 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDIN G FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. You can identify these statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as may, will, should, expect, anticipate, project, target, estimate, intend, continue or believe or the negatives of, or other variations on, these terms or comparable terminology. You should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss our plans, strategies, prospects and expectations concerning our business, operating results, financial condition and other similar matters. We believe that it is important to communicate our future expectations to our investors. Our forward-looking statements include information in this report regarding general domestic and global economic conditions, our future financing plans, our ability to operate as a business development company BDC and the expected performance of, and the yield on, our portfolio companies. There may be events in the future, however, that we are not able to predict accurately or control. The factors listed under Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as well as any cautionary language in this report, provide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward-looking statements. The occurrence of the events described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this report could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this report speaks only as of the date of this report. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. You are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we have filed or in the future may file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), including annual reports on Form 10-K, registration statements on Form N-2, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The safe harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), which preclude civil liability for certain forward-looking statements, do not apply to the forward-looking statements in this quarterly report because we are an investment company. The following factors are among those that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements: 
 our future operating results; 

disruptions in the capital markets, market conditions, and general economic uncertainty; 

changes in political, economic, social or industry conditions, the interest rate environment or conditions affecting the financial and capital markets, including the effect of any pandemic or epidemic;

 Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. GSAM ), a Delaware limited partnership and an affiliate of Goldman Sachs Co. LLC (including its predecessors, GS Co. ), is the investment adviser (the Investment Adviser of the Company. The term Goldman Sachs refers to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS Group Inc. ), together with GS Co., GSAM and its other subsidiaries. The Company is conducting an offering pursuant to which investors will make a capital commitment (a Commitment to purchase Units pursuant to a subscription agreement entered into with the Company pursuant to which the investor will agree to purchase Units for an aggregate purchase price equal to its Commitment. Each investor will be required to purchase the Company s Units each time the Company delivers a drawdown notice at least 10 business days prior to the required funding date (the Drawdown Date ). The offering and sale of Units will be exempt from registration pursuant to Regulation D and Regulation S promulgated under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for offers and sales of securities that do not involve a public offering and for offers and sale of securities outside of the United States. On October 6, 2022, the Company received a capital commitment of from an affiliate of the Investment Adviser (the Initial Member ). The Initial Member was the sole owner of the Company s interests until the period beginning on the first date on which investors in the Company are required to make the initial capital contribution to purchase Units, and Units are issued in respect thereof (the Initial Drawdown Date ). On October 19, 2022, the Company began accepting subscription agreements ("Subscription Agreements") from investors acquiring Units of the Company in the Company's private offering. Under the terms of the Subscription Agreements, investors are required to make capital contributions up to the undrawn amount of their capital commitment to purchase Units each time the Company delivers a drawdown notice.

Accelerated amortization of upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts 

Fees received from portfolio companies (directors fees, consulting fees, administrative fees, tax advisory fees and other similar compensation) are paid to the Company, unless, to the extent required by applicable law or exemptive relief, if any, therefrom, the Company only receives its allocable portion of such fees when invested in the same portfolio company as another Account (as defined below) managed by the Investment Adviser. Dividend income on preferred equity investments is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity investments is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies and on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Interest and dividend income are presented net of withholding tax, if any. Certain investments may have contractual payment in kind ("PIK") interest or dividends. PIK represents accrued interest or accumulated dividends that are added to the principal amount or shares (if equity) of the investment on the respective interest or dividend payment dates rather than being paid in cash and generally becomes due at maturity or upon the investment being called by the issuer. PIK is recorded as interest or dividend income, as applicable. If at any point the Company believes PIK is not expected to be realized, the investment generating PIK will be placed on non-accrual status. When a PIK investment is placed on non-accrual status, the accrued, uncapitalized interest or dividends are generally reversed through interest or dividend income, respectively. Certain structuring fees, amendment fees, syndication fees and commitment fees are recorded as other income when earned. Administrative agent fees received by the Company are recorded as other income when the services are rendered over time.

In order for the Company not to be subject to U.S. federal excise taxes, it must distribute annually an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) of its net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (ii) of its capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year and (iii) any net ordinary income and capital gains in excess of capital losses for preceding years that were not distributed during such years. The Company, at its discretion, may carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year dividends and pay a nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on this income. If the Company chooses to do so, this generally would increase expenses and reduce the amount available to be distributed to Unitholders. The Company will accrue excise tax on estimated undistributed taxable income as required. Certain of the Company s consolidated subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal and state corporate level income taxes. Income tax expense, if any, is included under the income category for which it applies in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

 The Hurdle Rate will be determined on a quarterly basis, and will be calculated by multiplying by the Company's NAV at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter, adjusted for the Company s subscriptions and distributions during the applicable calendar quarter. The Incentive Fee will be calculated and paid quarterly in arrears. The Incentive Fee is a fee owed by the Company to the Investment Adviser and is not paid out of distributions made to Unitholders.

Distributions The Company has a voluntary distribution reinvestment plan (the "DRIP") that provides for the automatic reinvestment of all cash distributions declared by the Board of Directors unless a Unitholder elects to opt out of the plan. As a result, if the Board of Directors declares a cash distribution, then the Unitholders who have not opted out of the DRIP will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested by the plan administrator, as agent for the Unitholders in administering the DRIP, in additional Units of the same class of Units, rather than receiving the cash distribution. Participation in the DRIP is completely voluntary. The company will use newly issued Units to implement the DRIP. The number of Units to be issued to a Unitholder is determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the distribution payable to such Unitholder, net of any applicable withholding tax, by the then-current NAV per Unit. For purposes of this calculation, the NAV per Unit may be based on the NAV per Unit calculated at the end of the most recent calendar month prior to the date of the applicable distribution, subject to adjustments for material changes and to the limitations of the Investment Company Act. The Company may terminate the DRIP upon notice in writing to each participant at least days prior to any record date for the payment of any distribution by the Company. The Initial Member has opted out of the DRIP.

 The following discussion and other parts of this report contain forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties. References to we, us, our, and the Company, mean Phillip Street Middle Market Lending Fund LLC or Phillip Street Middle Market Lending Fund LLC, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, as the context may require. The terms GSAM, Goldman Sachs Asset Management, , our Adviser or our Investment Adviser refer to Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership. The term GS Group Inc. refers to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS Co. refers to Goldman Sachs Co. LLC and its predecessors. The term Goldman Sachs refers to GS Group Inc., together with GS Co., GSAM and its other subsidiaries and affiliates. The discussion and analysis contained in this section refer to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. Please see Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with this discussion and analysis. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward-looking information due to factors discussed under Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements appearing elsewhere in this report. 
 OVERVIEW 
 We are a specialty finance company focused on lending to middle-market companies. We are a closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment Company Act"). In addition, we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company ("RIC"), and we expect to qualify annually for tax treatment, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2022. From our formation in 2022 through September 30, 2024, we have originated approximately 778.4 million in aggregate principal amount of debt investments prior to any subsequent exits and repayments. We seek to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation primarily through direct originations of secured debt, including first lien, unitranche debt, including last-out portions of such loans, and second lien debt, and unsecured debt, including mezzanine debt, as well as through select equity investments. 
 Unitranche loans are first lien loans that extend deeper in a borrower s capital structure than traditional first lien debt and may provide for a waterfall of cash flow priority between different lenders in such loan. In a number of instances, we may find another lender to provide the first-out portion of a unitranche loan while we retain the last-out portion of such loan, in which case, the first-out portion of the loan would generally receive priority with respect to the payment of principal, interest and any other amounts due thereunder as compared to the last-out portion that we would continue to hold. In exchange for taking greater risk of loss, the last-out portion generally earns a higher interest rate than the first-out portion of the loan. We use the term mezzanine to refer to debt that ranks senior in right of payment only to a borrower s equity securities and ranks junior in right of payment to all of such borrower s other indebtedness. We may make multiple investments in the same portfolio company. 
 We may also originate or invest in covenant-lite loans, which are loans with fewer financial maintenance covenants than other obligations, or no financial maintenance covenants. Such covenant-lite loans may not include terms that allow the lender to monitor the performance of the borrower or to declare a default if certain criteria are breached. These flexible covenants (or the absence of covenants) could permit borrowers to experience a significant downturn in their results of operations without triggering any default that would permit holders of their debt (such as us) to accelerate indebtedness or negotiate terms and pricing. Accordingly, to the extent we invest in covenant-lite loans, we may have fewer rights against a borrower and may have a greater risk of loss on such investments as compared to investments in or exposure to loans with financial maintenance covenants. Therefore, our investments may result in an above-average amount of risk and volatility or loss of principal. We also may invest in other assets, including cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other short-term investments, as described above. These investments entail additional risks that could adversely affect our investment returns. 
 32 

Table of Contents 

 We expect to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 90 of our net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in private middle-market credit obligations and related instruments. We define credit obligations and related instruments for this purpose as any fixed-income instrument, including loans to, and bonds, preferred stock of and other instruments, portfolio companies that provide exposure to fixed-income instruments. These other instruments may not by definition be fixed-income instruments, but structurally have the underlying investment risk and return profile and income-payment profile of fixed-income instruments. Middle market is used to refer to companies with between 5 million and 200 million of annual EBITDA, adjusted for certain one-time and non-recurring expenses that are outside the ordinary operations of these companies, along with companies that we determine, based on other metrics, including recurring revenue or tower cash flow, are middle market companies. Following such time that the aggregate amount of capital contributions to us made by Unitholders equals or exceeds 450 million, but subject to market conditions and the availability of suitable investment opportunities, we generally expect to target allocations among private middle-market credit obligations and related instruments in the following ratios: (i) 45 to companies with between 5 million and 25 million of EBITDA, and (ii) 55 to companies with between 25 million and 75 million of EBITDA, in each case adjusted for certain one-time and non-recurring expenses that are outside the ordinary operations of these companies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may invest on an opportunistic basis in credit obligations of private middle-market companies with EBITDA outside of the foregoing ranges, including credit obligations of companies that we believe are middle market companies based on metrics such as recurring revenue and tower cash flow, as opposed to EBITDA. In addition, as a result of fluctuations in the asset value of one asset relative to another asset, private middle-market credit obligations and related instruments may not reflect the foregoing targets or may represent less than 90 of our net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) at any time. However, we may not invest, under normal circumstances, more than 20 of our net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in securities and other instruments that are not private middle-market credit obligations. In addition, we are subject to the investment guidelines, which are further described in Item 1. Business Investment Criteria . 
 We expect to invest in middle-market companies domiciled in the United States. We may from time to time invest opportunistically in large U.S. companies, stressed or distressed debt, structured products, private equity or other opportunities, subject to the investment guidelines and the limits imposed by the Investment Company Act. 
 While we expect our investment program to focus primarily on debt investments, our investments may include equity or equity features, such as a direct investment in the equity or convertible securities of a portfolio company or warrants or options to buy a minority interest in a portfolio company. Any warrants we may receive with debt securities will generally require only a nominal cost to exercise, so as a portfolio company appreciates in value, we may achieve additional investment return from these equity investments. We may structure the warrants to provide provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest holder, as well as puts, or rights to sell such securities back to the portfolio company, upon the occurrence of specified events. In many cases, we may also obtain registration rights in connection with these equity investments, which may include demand and piggyback registration rights (which would allow us to have equity securities from an investment in a portfolio company registered for public offering in connection with a planned registration of such equity securities by the portfolio company). 
 For a discussion of the competitive landscape we face, please see Item 1A. Risk Factors Competition We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities and Item 1. Business Competitive Advantages in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 KEY COMPONENTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Investments 
 Our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment, the amount of capital we have available to us and the competitive environment for the type of investments we make. 
 As a BDC, we generally will be prohibited from acquiring assets other than qualifying assets unless, after giving effect to any acquisition, at least 70 of our total assets are qualifying assets. Qualifying assets generally include securities of eligible portfolio companies, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt instruments maturing in one year or less from the time of investment. Under the Investment Company Act and the rules thereunder, eligible portfolio companies include (i) private U.S. operating companies, (ii) public U.S. operating companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange (e.g., the New York Stock Exchange) or registered under the Exchange Act, and (iii) public U.S. operating companies having a market capitalization of less than 250 million. Public U.S. operating companies whose securities are quoted on the over-the-counter bulletin board and through OTC Markets are not listed on a national securities exchange and therefore are eligible portfolio companies.

Table of Contents 

 Revenues 
 We generate revenues in the form of interest income on debt investments and, to a lesser extent, capital gains and distributions, if any, on equity securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Some of our investments may provide for deferred interest payments or payment-in-kind PIK income. The principal amount of the debt investments and any accrued but unpaid interest generally becomes due at the maturity date. 
 We generate revenues primarily through receipt of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, structuring, syndication, exit fees or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. Portfolio company fees (directors fees, consulting fees, administrative fees, tax advisory fees and other similar compensation) will be paid to us, unless, to the extent required by applicable law or exemptive relief, if any, therefrom, we receive our allocable portion of such fees when invested in the same portfolio company as other client accounts managed by our Investment Adviser (collectively with the Company, the Accounts ), which other Accounts could receive their allocable portion of such fee. We do not expect to receive material fee income as it is not our principal investment strategy. We record contractual prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income. 
 Dividend income on preferred equity investments is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity investments is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies and on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Interest and dividend income are presented net of withholding tax, if any. 
 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of the management fee (the Management Fee and the incentive fee (the Incentive Fee to our Investment Adviser, legal and professional fees, interest and other debt expenses and other operating and overhead related expenses. The Management Fee and Incentive Fee compensate our Investment Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing and monitoring our investments. We bear all other expenses of our operations and transactions in accordance with the investment management and advisory agreement (the Investment Management Agreement and administration agreement (the Administration Agreement ), including: 
 our operational, offering and organizational expenses; 

fees and expenses, including travel expenses, incurred by our Investment Adviser or payable to third parties related to our investments, including, among others, professional fees (including the fees and expenses of consultants and experts) and fees and expenses from evaluating, monitoring, researching and performing due diligence on investments and prospective investments; 

interest, fees and other expenses payable on indebtedness for borrowed money (including through the issuance of notes and other evidence of indebtedness), other indebtedness, financings or extensions of credit, if any, incurred by us;

the expenses of and fees for registering or qualifying our Units for sale and of maintaining our registration or qualifying and registering us as a broker or a dealer; 

the fees and expenses of our directors who are not affiliated with our Investment Adviser; 

the cost of preparing and distributing reports, proxy statements and notices to our Unitholders, the SEC and other regulatory authorities; 

costs of holding Unitholder meetings; 

the fees or disbursements of custodians of our assets, including expenses incurred in the performance of any obligations enumerated by limited liability company agreement or other organizational documents insofar as they govern agreements with any such custodian; 

insurance premiums; and 

costs incurred in connection with any claim, litigation, arbitration, mediation, government investigation or dispute in connection with our business and the amount of any judgment or settlement paid in connection therewith, or the enforcement of our rights against any person and indemnification or contribution expenses payable by us to any person and other extraordinary expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of our business.

Table of Contents 

Our Investment Adviser will not be required to pay expenses of activities which are primarily intended to result in sales of Units. 
 We expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or decline as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset growth and to increase during periods of asset declines. 
 Leverage 
 We expect from time to time to borrow funds for a variety of purposes, subject to the limitations of the Investment Company Act, including to bridge fundings for investments in advance of drawdowns, as part of our investment strategy and to meet other short-term liquidity needs, including to pay the Management Fee. Sources of leverage include the issuance of senior securities (including preferred stock) and other credit facilities (secured by investments and/or pledges of undrawn commitments). Our secured credit facility (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the Credit Facility with Ally Bank ("Ally"), as administrative agent, allows us to borrow money and lever our investment portfolio, subject to the limitations of the Investment Company Act, with the objective of increasing our yield. This is known as leverage and could increase or decrease returns to our Unitholders. The use of leverage involves significant risks. We are permitted to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the Investment Company Act, is at least 150 after such borrowing (if certain requirements are met). 
 
 Certain trading practices and investments, such as reverse repurchase agreements, may be considered borrowings or involve leverage and thus may be subject to Investment Company Act restrictions. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered borrowings for these purposes. Practices and investments that may involve leverage but are not considered borrowings are not subject to the Investment Company Act s asset coverage requirement. The amount of leverage that we employ will depend on the assessment by our Investment Adviser and our board of directors (the Board of Directors or the Board of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing.

(1) The weighted average yield of our portfolio does not represent the total return to our Unitholders. 

(2) Computed based on (a) the annual actual interest rate or yield earned plus amortization of fees and discounts on the performing debt and other income producing investments as of the reporting date, divided by (b) the total investments (including investments on non-accrual and non-income producing investments) at amortized cost or fair value. 

(3) The calculation includes incremental yield earned on the "last-out" portion of the unitranche loan investments. 

(4) Computed based on (a) the stated coupon rate, if any, for each income-producing investment, divided by (b) the total investments (including investments on non-accrual and non-income producing investments) at amortized cost or fair value. 

As of September 30, 2024, the total portfolio weighted average yield measured at amortized cost and fair value was 10.9 and 10.8 , as compared to 12.6 and 12.6 as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in the weighted average yield at amortized cost and fair value was primarily driven by tightening of market conditions.

 For a particular portfolio company, we calculate the level of contractual indebtedness net of cash net debt owed by the portfolio company and compare that amount to measures of cash flow available to service the net debt. To calculate net debt, we include debt that is both senior and pari passu to the tranche of debt owned by us but exclude debt that is legally and contractually subordinated in ranking to the debt owned by us. We believe this calculation method assists in describing the risk of our portfolio investments, as it takes into consideration contractual rights of repayment of the tranche of debt owned by us relative to other senior and junior creditors of a portfolio company. We typically calculate cash flow available for debt service at a portfolio company by taking EBITDA for the trailing twelve-month period. Weighted average net debt to EBITDA is weighted based on the fair value of our debt investments, excluding investments where net debt to EBITDA may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk, such as cash collateralized loans and investments that are underwritten and covenanted based on recurring revenue. 

For a particular portfolio company, we also calculate the level of contractual interest expense owed by the portfolio company and compare that amount to EBITDA interest coverage ratio ). We believe this calculation method assists in describing the risk of our portfolio investments, as it takes into consideration contractual interest obligations of the portfolio company. Weighted average interest coverage is weighted based on the fair value of our performing debt investments, excluding investments where interest coverage may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk, such as cash collateralized loans and investments that are underwritten and covenanted based on recurring revenue. 

Median EBITDA is based on our debt investments, excluding investments where net debt to EBITDA may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk, such as cash collateralized loans and investments that are underwritten and covenanted based on recurring revenue. 

Portfolio company statistics are derived from the most recently available financial statements of each portfolio company as of the reported end date. Statistics of the portfolio companies have not been independently verified by us and may reflect a normalized or adjusted amount. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, investments where net debt to EBITDA may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk represented 14.42 and 35.7 of total debt investments at fair value. 

Our Investment Adviser monitors, on an ongoing basis, the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if it is meeting its respective business plan and to assess the appropriate course of action for each portfolio company. Our Investment Adviser has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following: (i) assessment of success in adhering to the portfolio company s business plan and compliance with covenants; (ii) periodic or regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; (iii) comparisons to our other portfolio companies in the industry, if any; (iv) attendance at and participation in Board meetings or presentations by portfolio companies; and (v) review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections of portfolio companies. 
 As part of the monitoring process, our Investment Adviser also employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our Investment Adviser grades the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 4 no less frequently than quarterly. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also take into account in certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. The grading system for our investments is as follows: 
 	 Grade 1 investments involve the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis. The trends and risk factors for this investment since origination or acquisition are generally favorable, which may include the performance of the portfolio company or a potential exit; 
 	 Grade 2 investments involve a level of risk to our initial cost basis that is similar to the risk to our initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition. This portfolio company is generally performing as expected and the risk factors to our ability to ultimately recoup the cost of our investment are neutral to favorable. All investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially assessed a grade of 2; 
 	 Grade 3 investments indicate that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has increased materially since origination or acquisition, including as a result of factors such as declining performance and non-compliance with debt covenants; however, payments are generally not more than 120 days past due; and 
 	 Grade 4 investments indicate that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has substantially increased since origination or acquisition, and the portfolio company likely has materially declining performance. For debt investments with an investment grade of 4, in most cases, most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. For investments graded 4, it is anticipated that we will not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a substantial loss of our initial cost basis upon exit.

 Our Investment Adviser grades the investments in our portfolio at least each quarter and it is possible that the grade of a portfolio investment may be reduced or increased over time. For investments graded 3 or 4, our Investment Adviser enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company. The following table shows the composition of our portfolio (excluding investments in money market funds, if any) on the 1 to 4 grading scale:

Investments are placed on non-accrual status when it is probable that principal, interest or dividends will not be collected according to the contractual terms. Accrued interest or dividends generally are reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Interest or dividend payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment. Non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest or dividends are paid and, in management s judgment, principal and interest or dividend payments are likely to remain current. We may make exceptions to this treatment if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.

This was primarily due to an increase in our aggregate borrowings outstanding during the period. 

Incentive Fees increased from 0 and 0 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.56 million and 1.05 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily driven by the performance of the investment portfolio for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. For additional information, see Note 3 Significant Agreements and Related Party Transactions in our consolidated financial statements included in this report. 

Management Fees increased from 0.37 million and 0.95 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.98 million and 2.25 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by an increase in members' capital. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Investment Adviser voluntarily waived 0 million and 0.29 million of its Management Fees. 

Offering costs decreased from 0.32 million and 0.98 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 0 million and 0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. This decrease is because Offering costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over 12 months beginning on the date of commencement of operations.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 The primary use of existing funds and any funds raised in the future is expected to be for our investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to our Unitholders or for other general corporate purposes, including paying for operating expenses or debt service to the extent we borrow or issue senior securities. 
 We expect to generate cash primarily from the net proceeds of any future offerings of our Units, drawdowns of capital commitments, future borrowings and cash flows from operations. Subject to the terms of our Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement (as it may be amended or amended and restated from time to time, the LLC Agreement ), to the extent we determine that additional capital would allow us to take advantage of additional investment opportunities, if the market for debt financing presents attractively priced debt financing opportunities, or if our Board of Directors otherwise determines that leveraging our portfolio would be in our best interest and the best interests of our Unitholders, we may enter into credit facilities in addition to our Credit Facility, or issue other senior securities. Subject to the terms of the LLC Agreement, we would expect any such credit facilities may be secured by certain of our assets and may contain advance rates based upon pledged collateral. The pricing and other terms of any such facilities would depend upon market conditions when we enter into any such facilities as well as the performance of our business, among other factors. As a BDC, with certain limited exceptions, we are only permitted to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the Investment Company Act, is at least 150 after such borrowing (if certain requirements are met). We may also refinance or repay any of our indebtedness at any time based on our financial condition and market conditions. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our asset coverage ratio based on the aggregate amount outstanding of our senior securities was 402 and 1,053 . We may also refinance or repay any of our indebtedness at any time based on our financial condition and market conditions.

 We may enter into investment commitments through signed commitment letters, that may ultimately become investment transactions in the future. We regularly evaluate and carefully consider our unfunded commitments using GSAM s proprietary risk management framework for the purpose of planning our capital resources and ongoing liquidity, including our financial leverage. 
 An affiliate of the Investment Adviser made a capital commitment to us of 10,000 on October 6, 2022 (commencement of operations) and served as our initial member (the Initial Member ). We began accepting subscription agreements (the Subscription Agreements from investors acquiring Units in our private offering. Under the terms of the Subscription Agreements, investors are required to make capital contributions up to the amount of their undrawn capital commitment to purchase Units each time we deliver a drawdown notice. 
 As of the dates indicated, we had aggregate capital commitments and undrawn capital commitments from investors as follows:

Contractual Obligations 
 We have entered into certain contracts under which we have future commitments. Payments under the Investment Management Agreement, pursuant to which GSAM has agreed to serve as our Investment Adviser, are equal to (1) Management Fee equal to a percentage of value of our average NAV at the end of the then-current calendar quarter and the prior calendar quarter and (2) an Incentive Fee based on pre-incentive fee net investment income.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We may become a party to investment commitments and to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of our business to fund investments and to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2024, we believed that we had adequate financial resources to satisfy our unfunded commitments. Our unfunded commitments to provide funds to portfolio companies were as follows:

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ materially. 
 For a description of our critical accounting policies, see Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. We consider the most significant accounting policies to be those related to our Valuation of Portfolio Investments, Revenue Recognition, Non-Accrual Investments, Distribution Policy and Income Taxes. We consider the most significant critical estimate to be the fair value measurement of investments. The critical accounting policies and estimates should be read in connection with our risk factors listed under Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Fair Value Measurement of Investments 
 Consistent with GAAP and the Investment Company Act, we conduct a valuation of our investments, pursuant to which our NAV is determined. Our investments are valued on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if required under the Investment Company Act. The determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. The majority of investments are not quoted or traded in an active market and as such their fair values are determined using valuation techniques, primarily discounted cash flows, market multiples, and recent comparable transactions. The most significant inputs in applying the discounted cash flow approach and the market multiples approach are the selected discount rates and multiples, respectively. The selection of these inputs is based on a combination of factors that are specific to the underlying portfolio companies such as financial performance and certain factors that are observable in the market such as current interest rates and comparable public company trading multiples. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of these valuations and any change in these valuations on the consolidated financial statements. For further details of our investments and fair value measurement accounting policy, see Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies Investments and Note 5 Fair Value Measurement. 
 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
 On November 1, 2024, we delivered a capital drawdown notice to our investors relating to the issuance and sale of Units for an aggregate offering price of approximately 37.5 million. The Units will be issued on or about November 15, 2024. 
 We will pay a distribution equal to an amount up to the Company s taxable earnings per unit, including net investment income (if positive) for the period October 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024, payable on or about January 28, 2025 to Unitholders of record as of December 31, 2024.

 ITEM 3.	QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are subject to financial market risks, most significantly changes in interest rates. Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in our earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we expect to fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is expected to be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, we can offer no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, on a fair value basis, 100.0 of our performing debt investments bore interest at a floating rate. Our borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a floating rate. 
 We regularly measure our exposure to interest rate risk. We assess interest rate risk and manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities. 
 Based on our September 30, 2024 Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, the following table shows the annual impact on net income of base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments) assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure:

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
