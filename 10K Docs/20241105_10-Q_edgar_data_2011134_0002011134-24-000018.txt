KIONI HOLDINGS LIMITED 

 NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 

NOTE 1 ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS 

Kioni Holdings Limited (the Company is a corporation established under the corporation laws in the State of Delaware on November 28, 2023. The Company is engaged in the business
of providing back-office support to companies. Kioni offers progressive and complete solutions for our customer's back office and administration
needs. These services include accounting and bookkeeping, human resources, digital marketing and sales, IT support and general business
consulting. 

The Company has adopted December 31 fiscal year end. 

The Company and its wholly owned subsidiary-Gold Times
Holdings Limited, which was acquired on June 19, 2024, are referred to as the Group . 

NOTE 2 GOING CONCERN 

The Group s consolidated financial statements
as of September 30, 2024 been prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a
going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Group
has not yet established a consistent ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a
going concern. The Group had accumulated loss of 98,215 for the period ended September 30, 2024. These factors among others raise substantial
doubt about the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern. 

In order to continue as a going concern, the Group
will need, among other things, additional capital resources. The Company has raised 100,000 by selling its shares through a registration
statement, which became effective on April 23 2024. Management s plan is to seek additional debt financing. However, management
cannot provide any assurances that the Group will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans to raise the addition debt financing
required for its operations. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and
classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Group be unable to continue
as a going concern. 

NOTE 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The results for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the full year. These consolidated financial statements and related
footnotes should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Group s
Annual Report on Form 10K for the period ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements
have been prepared by the Group without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments)
necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows at September 30, 2024 and for the related periods
presented. 

Basis of Presentation 

The consolidated financial statements of the Group
have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Group functional
and operational currency is US Dollar. 

Principles of Consolidation And Equity Accounting 

 Subsidiaries 

Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured
entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity where the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns
from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group. They are deconsolidated from the date
that control ceases. 

 The acquisition method of accounting is used to account
for business combinations by the group (see note Business Combinations). 

Inter-company transactions, balances and
unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction
provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to
ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. 

7 | P a g e 

Table of Contents 

Equity method 

Under the equity method of accounting, the investments
are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses
of the investee in profit or loss, and the Group s share of movements in other comprehensive income of the investee in other comprehensive
income. Dividends received or receivable from associates and joint ventures are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of the
investment. 

 Where the Group s share of losses in an
equity-accounted investment equals or exceeds its interest in the entity, including any other unsecured long-term receivables, the Group
does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the other entity. 

 Unrealised gains on transactions between the
Group and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group s interest in these entities. Unrealised losses
are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of equity-accounted
investees have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. 

 Business Combinations 

Goodwill is stated after separate recognition
of identifiable intangible assets. It is calculated as the excess of the sum of: (a) fair value of consideration transferred, (b) the
recognized amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, and (c) acquisition-date fair value of any existing equity interest
in the acquiree, over the acquisition-date fair values of identifiable net assets. 

 Any contingent consideration to be transferred
by the acquirer is recognized at acquisition-date fair value. Subsequent adjustments to consideration are recognized against goodwill
only to the extent that they arise from new information obtained within the measurement period (a maximum of 12 months from the acquisition
date) about the fair value at the acquisition date. All other subsequent adjustments to contingent consideration classified as an asset
or a liability are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. 

 Cash and Cash Equivalents 

For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Group
considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

As of September 30, 2024, the Group has not issued
any stock-based payments to its employees. 

Stock-based compensation is accounted for at fair value
in accordance with ASC 718, when applicable. To date, the Group has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock
options. 

Use of Estimates 

Preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management s
estimates and assumptions. 

Income Taxes 

The Group follows the liability method of accounting
for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective income tax basis (temporary differences).
 The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes
the enactment date. 

The Group utilizes the Financial Accounting Standards
Board's Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740 related to Income Taxes to account for the uncertainty in income taxes. Topic 740
for Income Taxes clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing rules for recognition, measurement and classification
in consolidated financial statements of tax positions taken or expected to be in a tax return. Further, it prescribes a two-step process
for the financial statement measurement and recognition of a tax position. The first step involves the determination of whether it is
more likely than not (greater than 50 percent likelihood) that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical
merits of the position. The second step requires that any tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold be measured
and recognized in the consolidated financial statements at the largest amount of benefit that is a greater than 50 percent likelihood
of being realized upon ultimate settlement. This topic also provides guidance on the accounting for related interest and penalties, financial
statement classification and disclosure. The Group's policy is that any interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized
in income tax expense when incurred. The Group has no uncertain tax positions or related interest or penalties requiring accrual at June
30, 2024.

Table of Contents 

New Accounting Pronouncements 

There were various accounting standards and interpretations
issued recently, none of which are expected to a have a material impact on our financial position, operations or cash flows. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

ASC 825, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
Instruments , requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments. ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements 
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures
about fair value measurements. Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information
available to management as of September 30, 2024. 

 The respective carrying values of certain on-balance-sheet
financial instruments approximate their fair values. These financial instruments include cash and related party loan payable. Fair values
were assumed to approximate carrying values for these financial instruments since they are short term in nature and their carrying amounts
approximate fair value. 

Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share 

The Group computes earnings (loss) per share in accordance
with ASC 260-10-45 Earnings per Share , which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face
of the statement of operations. Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net earnings (loss) available to common stockholders
by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share gives effect to all dilutive
potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive earnings (loss) per share excludes all potential common shares if their
effect is anti-dilutive. The Group has no potential dilutive instruments, and therefore, basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share are
equal. 

NOTE 4 CAPITAL STOCK 

The Group has 1,000,000 shares of common stock authorized with a par value
of 0.0001 per share. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Group had 1,000,000 shares issued and outstanding. 

NOTE 5 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

In support of the Group s efforts and cash requirements,
it may rely on advances from related parties until such time that the Group can support its operations or attains adequate financing through
sales of its equity or traditional debt financing. There is no formal written commitment for continued support by officers, directors,
or shareholders. Amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities. The advances are considered temporary in nature
and have not been formalized by a promissory note. 

During the period ended September 30, 2024, the sole
director of the Group subscribed for 50,000 shares in the Group for 10,000 in January 2024. From November 28,2023 (inception) through
December 31, 2023 the sole director subscribed for a total of 10,000 shares in the Group for 2,000. 

NOTE 6. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 

The Group has evaluated and determined that there are
no subsequent events from September 30, 2024 to the date the consolidated financial statements were issued.

Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION 

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 

Statements made in this Form 10-Q that are not historical
or current facts are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities
Act of 1933 (the Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements often can be identified by
the use of terms such as may, will, expect, believe, anticipate, estimate, 
 approximate or continue, or the negative thereof. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to
the safe harbors for such statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which
speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management's best judgment as to what may occur in the future.
However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual
results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected.
We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of
such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.

PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING 

We expect that working capital requirements will continue
to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected
to increase in line with the growth of our business. 

Existing working capital, further advances and debt
instruments, sale of our shares, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next twelve months.
We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of
the private placement of equity. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses
and capital expenditures relating to: (i) developmental expenses associated with a newly established business; and (ii) marketing expenses.
We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise
additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt
securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges
senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available
or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities,
which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not
have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that
are material to investors. 

GOING CONCERN 

The independent auditors' report accompanying our September
30, 2024 consolidated financial statements contained an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, 
which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. 

Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

As a smaller reporting company 
as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Group is not required to provide information required by this Item. 

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e)) within the end of
the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that as a result of material
weaknesses related to lack of segregation of duties and multiple levels of review over the financial reporting process, our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we
file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules
and forms. 

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in the Group's internal
control over financial reporting during the last quarterly period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Group's internal control over financial reporting.
