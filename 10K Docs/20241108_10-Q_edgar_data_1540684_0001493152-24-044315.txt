CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions
for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). All statements other than statements
of historical fact contained in this Quarterly Report are forward-looking statements, including without limitation, statements regarding
current expectations, as of the date of this Quarterly Report, our future results of operations and financial position, our ability to
effectively process our minerals and achieve commercial grade at scale; risks and hazards inherent in the mining business (including
risks inherent in exploring, developing, constructing and operating mining projects, environmental hazards, industrial accidents, weather
or geologically related conditions); uncertainty about our ability to obtain required capital to execute our business plan; our ability
to hire and retain required personnel; changes in the market prices of lithium and lithium products and demand for such products; the
uncertainties inherent in exploratory, developmental and production activities, including risks relating to permitting, zoning and regulatory
delays related to our projects; uncertainties inherent in the estimation of lithium resources. These statements involve known and unknown
risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from
any future results, performance or achievement expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. 

In
some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as may, will, should, 
 expect, plan, anticipate, could, intend, target, 
 project, contemplate, believe, estimate, predict, potential, 
or continue or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions Factors that could cause future results to materially
differ from the recent results or those projected in forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: unprofitable efforts
resulting not only from the failure to discover mineral deposits, but also from finding mineral deposits that, though present, are insufficient
in quantity and quality to return a profit from production; market fluctuations; government regulations, including regulations relating
to permitting, royalties, allowable production, importing and exporting of minerals, and environmental protection; competition; the loss
of services of key personnel; unusual or infrequent weather phenomena, litigation, sabotage, government or other interference in the
maintenance or provision of infrastructure as well as general economic conditions. 

The
forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report are based largely on our current expectations and projections about future events
and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These forward-looking statements
speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report and are subject to a number of important factors that could cause actual results to
differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including the factors described under the sections in this Quarterly
Report titled Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations and other of our filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). Additional information
regarding risk factors that may affect us is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the
 2023 Annual Report filed with the SEC on March 27, 2024. The risk factors contained in our 2023 Annual Report are updated
by us from time to time in Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and other filings that we make with the SEC. 

You
should read this Quarterly Report and the documents that we reference in this Quarterly Report completely and with the understanding
that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. Given these uncertainties, we caution you not to place
undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise
any forward-looking statements contained herein, whether as a result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances or
otherwise.

Exploration
costs such as drilling, development and related costs are either classified as exploration and charged to operations as incurred, or
capitalized, such as to assist with mine planning within a reserve area. Whether to capitalize an exploration cost or incur an
expense also depends on whether the drilling or development costs relate to an ore body that has been determined to be commercially
mineable and whether the expenditure relates to a probable future benefit to be generated singly or in combination with
other assets. The basis of the mineral interest is amortized on a units-of-production basis. 

The Company previously reported it was acquiring five
mineral rights totaling hectares pursuant to a mineral rights purchase agreement entered into on January 19, 2023 (the Acquisition
Agreement ). After a period of preliminary assessment, the Company and the counterparty to the agreement agreed to revise the terms
of the acquisition, following which the Company ultimately consummated the acquisition of only one mineral right totaling hectares.
The mineral right is located in the municipalities of Ara ua and Itinga, in a region known as Lithium Valley 
in the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil. The Company s obligations under the Acquisition Agreement as revised were: 

Payment of , which payment took place on January 19, 2023, and

Leases 

For
the reporting period ended September 30, 2024, no financial leases meeting the criteria outlined in ASC 842 have been identified. 

Operating
Leases 

Right
of use ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the
future lease payments over the lease term. When the rate implicit to the lease cannot be readily determined, we utilize our incremental
borrowing rate in determining the present value of the future lease payments. The ROU asset includes any lease payments made and lease
incentives received prior to the commencement date. Operating lease ROU assets also include any cumulative prepaid or accrued rent when
the lease payments are uneven throughout the lease term. The ROU assets and lease liabilities may include options to extend or terminate
the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. The ROU and lease liabilities are primarily related to commercial
offices with third parties. 

The
lease agreements have terms between to years and the liability was measured at the present value of the lease payments discounted
using interest rates with a weighted average rate of 6.5 , which was determined to be the Company s incremental borrowing rate.
The continuity of the lease liabilities is presented in the table below:

On
December 20, 2022, the Company made the appropriate filings with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada SOS that
were intended to effect the Originally Intended Reverse Stock Split (the Original Articles Amendment ). In April 2023, the
Board determined that due to an error, the Original Articles Amendment was a nullity and that it would be in the best interest of the

of incorporation to decrease the number of shares of authorized common stock to two hundred million and to amend certain
other provisions in the Company s articles (the Amended and Restated Articles ). The Board and the Majority Stockholder
determined to decrease the number of shares of authorized common stock to reduce the number of shares available for issuance given the
negative perception the dilutive effect of having such a large number of shares available for issuance may have on any potential future

2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The
following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated
financial statements and the notes to those financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly
Report and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and related Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 

This
Quarterly Report includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors described in the section
entitled Risk Factors in Item 1.A. of Part II of this Report that could cause actual results could differ materially from
those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. Additionally, our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results
that may be expected for any period in the future. 

Overview 

Atlas
Lithium Corporation Atlas Lithium , the Company , we , us , or our 
refer to Atlas Lithium Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries) is a mineral exploration and development company with a developing
lithium project and multiple lithium exploration properties. In addition, we own exploration properties in other battery minerals, including
nickel, copper, rare earths, graphite, and titanium. Our current focus is the development from exploration to future active mining of
our hard-rock lithium project located in the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil at a well-known pegmatitic district in Brazil, which has
been denominated by the government of Minas Gerais as Lithium Valley. We intend to mine and then process our lithium-containing
ore to produce lithium concentrate (also known as spodumene concentrate), a key ingredient for the battery supply chain. 

Our modular plant targeted at
producing up to 150,000 tons of lithium concentrate per annum tpa in what we describe as Phase I is in final phase
of fabrication. We plan on adding additional modules to the plant with the intent of doubling its production capacity to up to
300,000 tpa in Phase II. However, there can be no assurance that we will have the necessary capital resources to develop such facility or, if developed, that we will reach the production capacity necessary to commercialize our products and with the quality
needed to meet market demand. 

All
our mineral projects and properties are located in Brazil, a well-established mining jurisdiction. Our lithium properties include approximately
53,942 hectares (539 km 2 divided in 95 mineral rights (2 in pre-mining concession stage, 85 in exploration stage, and 8 in
pre-exploration stage). 

In
addition, we also have a few additional lithium mineral rights that are in the process of being acquired and not yet titled in our name. 

25 

 Table of Contents 

We
are primarily focused on advancing and developing our hard-rock lithium project located in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Our Minas
Gerais Lithium Project MGLP consists of 85 mineral rights spread over approximately 468 km 2 and predominantly
located within the Brazilian Eastern Pegmatitic Province which has been surveyed by the Brazilian Geological Survey and is known for
the presence of hard rock formations known as pegmatites which contain lithium-bearing minerals such as spodumene and petalite. Our primary
area of focus is the Neves Project, which is part of MGLP. The Neves Project has been drilled extensively and presents spodumene-bearing
deposits amenable to open pit mining, with generation of ore material that can be processed by dense media separation technique to yield
lithium concentrate, a commercial product within the battery supply chain. 

We
own approximately 44.74 of the shares of common stock of Apollo Resources, a private company primarily focused on the development of
its initial iron mine. 

We
also own approximately 21.01 of the shares of common stock of Jupiter Gold, a company with an operating quartzite quarry and gold projects
in exploration phase, the common stock of which is quoted on the OTCQB marketplace under the symbol JUPGF. 

The
results of operations from both Apollo Resources and Jupiter Gold are consolidated in our financial statements under U.S. GAAP. 

On October 31, 2024, Jupiter Gold and Apollo Resources
entered into an agreement and plan of merger pursuant to which Apollo will merge with and into Jupiter, with Jupiter continuing its corporate
existence as the surviving corporation. This transaction is expected to be completed by December 31, 2024. 

Operational
Update 

During the third quarter of 2024, we achieved several
important operational developments: 

In August 2024, our modular dense media separation (DMS) lithium processing
plant entered its final phase of fabrication. The DMS modules of the plant successfully underwent trial assembly in South Africa. Some
 parts remaining in near-final stages of fabrication at that time included effluent components, recently modified to improve
water efficiency, as well as conveyors. The plant s modular design, which has never before been used for lithium processing in Brazil,
represents an optimized approach featuring reduced height, weight, and physical footprint compared to traditional designs. The plant is
engineered to achieve the lowest processing circuit water usage in the industry. 

Also in August 2024, our spodumene concentrate plant design was selected
as a finalist for a November 14, 2024 contest, organized by a non-profit civil society organization in the state of Minas Gerais, recognizing
environmentally-sustainable approaches in the industry. 

[ 

In early October 2024, we announced the discovery of spodumene-rich pegmatites
in our Salinas Project area, located approximately 60 miles north of our flagship Neves Project. The Salinas Project spans 388 hectares
(approximately 959 acres) and is situated just 5 miles east of Latin Resources Colina Project, a significant lithium deposit. Our technical
team has completed soil geochemistry and LIDAR geological mapping with favorable results and is now pursuing further geological and geophysical
studies prior to initiation of a drilling campaign. 

On October 25, 2024, a voting board comprised of twelve representatives
from the local civil society and government unanimously approved Atlas Lithium s license application for its Neves Project, resulting
in the formal issuance of the permit. The permit authorizes Atlas Lithium to assemble and operate its lithium processing plant, to process
mined ore from one of its deposits at the facility, and to sell the lithium concentrate that it produces.

Results
of Operations 

The
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Net
loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, totaled 32,855,151, compared to net loss of 25,600,602 during the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The increase is mainly due to: 

After a trial mining period in the second half of 2023, Jupiter Gold commenced
ongoing operations at its quartzite quarry in 2024. Our gross margin of 249,722 was generated from the sales of 269 m 3 of
unprocessed blocks of quartzite produced by Jupiter Gold. By comparison, there was no gross margin generation in the nine months ended
September 30, 2023 

Higher
 general and administrative expenses of approximately 5.7 million in the period primarily due to increased costs of labor and consultants
 related to technical services, increased legal fees relating to transactions consummated during the quarter and other third-party
 costs; 

An
 increase of approximately 10.4 million in stock-based compensation expense compared to the prior period, reflecting bonus for the
 members of the management team eligible for stock-based compensation; and 

Higher
 finance costs of approximately 0.2 million for the period mainly due to interest expenses related to convertible notes issued in
 November 2023. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 22,056,560 and working capital of 16,401,099. 

Net
cash used by operating activities totaled 14,212,264 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash provided of 2,564,979
during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing a variation in the cash flow from operating activities of 16,777,243. The variation
in net cash used /provided by operating activities was mainly due to: 

In
 the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company received 20,000,000 arising from the one-time royalty sale with no matchable transaction
 in 2024, as explained in Note 3; and 

Increase
 of approximately 5,700,000 in general and administrative expenses due to the growth of the our personnel and infrastructure as we
 move towards revenue-generating operations. As a result, we had more expenditures such as employee compensation and the costs of third
parties service providers such as technical consultants.

 Table of Contents 

Net
cash used in investing activities totaled 23,559,858 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash used of
 771,977 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing an increase in cash used of 22,787,881 or 2,952 . The
increase reflects essentially: and capitalized exploration costs. 

The payments made in connection with the acquisition of our lithium processing
plant; and 

The capitalization of exploration costs incurred since April 2024. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities totaled 30,291,547 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 20,822,531 during
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing an increase in cash provided of 9,469,016 or 45 . The increase is mainly due
to the following financing activities that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023: 

The
 sale of an aggregate of 1,871,250 shares of our common stock to Mitsui in a private placement (the Private Placement ).
 The gross proceeds from the Private Placement were 30.0 million. 

For
further information on the transaction mentioned above, please refer to note 7 related parties transactions. 

We
have historically incurred net operating losses and have not yet generated material revenues from the sale of products or services. As
a result, our primary sources of liquidity have been derived through proceeds from the (i) sales of our equity and the equity of one
of our subsidiaries, and (ii) issuance of convertible debt. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 22,056,560 and
working capital of 16,401,099, compared to cash and cash equivalents 29,549,927 and a working capital of 23,809,637 as of December
31, 2023. We believe our cash and equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements
for a period of at least twelve months from the date of these financial statements. However, our future short- and long-term capital
requirements will depend on several factors, including but not limited to, the rate of our growth, our ability to identify areas for
mineral exploration and the economic potential of such areas, the exploration and other drilling campaigns needed to verify and expand
our mineral resources, the successful installation of our lithium processing facilities, and the ability to attract talent to manage
our different areas of endeavor. To the extent that our current resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may need
to seek additional equity or debt financing. If the needed financing is not available, or if the terms of financing are less desirable
than we expect, we may be forced to scale back our existing operations and growth plans, which could have an adverse impact on our business
and financial prospects and could raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

Currency
Risk 

We
operate primarily in Brazil, which exposes us to currency risks. Our business activities may generate intercompany receivables or payables
that are in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. Changes in exchange rates from the time the activity occurs
to the time payments are made may result in it receiving either more or less in local currency than the local currency equivalent at
the time of the original activity. 

Our
consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates between the applicable foreign
currency and the U.S. dollar affect the translation of each foreign subsidiary s financial results into U.S. dollars for purposes
of reporting in the consolidated financial statements. Our foreign subsidiaries translate their financial results from the local currency
into U.S. dollars in the following manner: (a) income statement accounts are translated at average exchange rates for the period; (b)
balance sheet asset and liability accounts are translated at end of period exchange rates; and (c) equity accounts are translated at
historical exchange rates. Translation in this manner affects the shareholders equity account referred to as the foreign currency
translation adjustment account. This account exists only in the foreign subsidiaries U.S. dollar balance sheets and is necessary
to keep the foreign subsidiaries balance sheets in agreement.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of American U.S. GAAP ).
Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies. We believe
that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our financial statements
is critical to an understanding of our financial statements.

The

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the
participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, has evaluated the design, operation, and effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act as of September 30, 2024. In
designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how
well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in reports filed
or submitted pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules
and forms of the Commission, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including its Principal Executive
Officer and Principal Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure .
In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management
is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. On the basis
of that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that as a result of the material weakness
in internal controls over financial reporting, described in our Amendment No. 1 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2024, filed on Form 10-K/A with the SEC on November 8, 2024 (the Form 10-K/A ), our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 for the reasons set forth below. 

As previously reported in our Amended Annual Report, we identified a material
weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023. During this period, the Company
outsourced its day-to-day accounting tasks due to limited accounting and financial reporting personnel and other resources needed to
ensure adherence to our internal controls and procedures. We had limited finance and accounting professionals with the requisite experience
to appropriately perform the supervision and review of the information received from the Company s third-party accounting service
provider. The lack of GAAP experience from the outsourced accounting firm combined with the limited availability of an experienced team
to supervise the third- party service provider resulted in the disclosed material weakness. 

Our remediation efforts in
response to this material weakness are ongoing and have included insourcing our accounting and finance functions and considering to hire
additional professionals.. We also continues the implementation of our SAP enterprise resource planning software. Our remediation efforts
will continue through the end of 2024 and beyond. While we have made substantial progress toward the remediation plan, the aforementioned
material weakness cannot be considered completely remediated until the applicable controls have operated for a sufficient period of time
and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

In May 2024, we concluded
the implementation of our SAP enterprise resource planning software and insourced the accounting and finance functions. 

Other than as discussed above,
there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially
affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations
of the Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes
that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the information
required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management,
including its Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect
the fact that there are resource constrains and that management is required to apply judgement in evaluating the benefits of possible
controls and procedures relative to their costs.
