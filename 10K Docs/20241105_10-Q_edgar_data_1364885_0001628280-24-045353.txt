 Airbus Term Sheet 
 
 Spirit and Airbus SE entered into the Airbus Term Sheet on June 30, 2024. The Airbus Term Sheet is a binding term sheet under which the parties have agreed to negotiate in good faith definitive agreements (the Definitive Agreements ), including a purchase agreement, providing for the acquisition by Airbus or its affiliates of the Spirit Airbus Business on the terms set forth in the Airbus Term Sheet with the goal of permitting Boeing and Holdings to consummate the Merger prior to the Outside Date. The Airbus Term Sheet provides that the execution of the Definitive Agreements will be subject to and conditioned upon the completion to the satisfaction of Airbus of its due diligence. The Airbus Term Sheet contemplates that specified portions of the Spirit Airbus Business, such as the portion of the Spirit Airbus Business in Prestwick, Scotland (the Airbus Prestwick Business ), may, instead of being acquired by Airbus or its affiliates, be acquired by one or more third parties. 
 
 Under the transaction terms set forth in the Airbus Term Sheet, Airbus would acquire from Spirit and its subsidiaries the Spirit Airbus Business, excluding any portions thereof to be acquired by third parties, and cash in the amount of 559.0 (subject to downward adjustment if the acquisition by Airbus includes the Airbus Prestwick Business) for nominal consideration of one dollar, subject to working capital and other purchase price adjustments and additional adjustments, to be agreed between the parties prior to execution and delivery of the Definitive Agreements, to reflect the fair market value of specified assets of the Spirit Airbus Business to the extent they are to be acquired by Airbus rather than third parties. 
 
 The transaction terms set forth in the Airbus Term Sheet include provisions for, among other things, the payment in full by Spirit to Airbus of any loans, advance payments, similar arrangements and undisputed liquidated damages owing from Spirit to Airbus (the Outstanding Amounts as of the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Airbus Term Sheet (the Airbus Transactions, and such closing, the Airbus Closing ), with any disputed liquidated damages to be resolved and paid in accordance with a mutually agreed dispute resolution process; transitional arrangements with respect to specified real estate; obtaining third-party consents; segregation of Spirit s business conducted primarily for the benefit of Airbus from the remainder of Spirit s business and treatment of vendor and supply contracts, employees, intellectual property, pensions and unfunded employee liabilities in connection with the separation of those portions of Spirit s business; mutual indemnification and releases; inclusion in the Definitive Agreements of customary representations, warranties and covenants; and transitional and other arrangements to be entered into by the parties at the Airbus Closing. 
 
 Under the transaction terms set forth in the Airbus Term Sheet, the Airbus Closing would be conditioned upon the receipt of applicable governmental and regulatory consents, approvals and clearances; the absence of any order, legal prohibition or injunction preventing the consummation of the Airbus Transactions; compliance by the parties with their pre-closing covenants in all material respects; payment in full of the Outstanding Amounts; the closing under the Merger Agreement occurring substantially concurrently with the Airbus Transactions; there being no material adverse change after the date of the Definitive Agreements and before the Airbus Closing in the business operations to be acquired by Airbus at the Airbus Closing; and Spirit s implementation in all material respects of technical measures and policies to protect confidential data of Airbus. 
 
 The Airbus Term Sheet provides that no binding agreement has been made with respect to the French aspects of the Airbus Transactions Airbus French Transactions ). Prior to the Company and Airbus and its affiliates entering into definitive agreements that are applicable to the Airbus French Transactions, Spirit and Airbus have agreed to comply with their respective information and consultation obligations with applicable employees and employee representatives. The Airbus Term Sheet also provides that the parties will complete necessary labor consultations and obtain necessary approvals from applicable unions and works councils in various jurisdictions, as may be legally required. 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) on a going concern basis, which assumes the Company will be able to continue as a going concern and contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, 

11 

Table of Contents 
 Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. 
 Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) 
 (U.S. Dollars in millions other than per share amounts) 

substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern exists. The Company has incurred net losses of , , , and , for the nine months ended September 26, 2024, and the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, and cash used in operating activities of , , , and , respectively for the same periods. As of September 26, 2024 , our debt balance was , including of debt classified as short-term. The Company s cash and cash equivalents were and as of September 26, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company will require additional liquidity to continue its operations over the next 12 months. 
 
 Further, certain changes made to the production and delivery process implemented by Boeing have had an immediate impact to the Company s results of operations and cash flows. On March 2, 2024, Boeing announced they would no longer accept deliveries of product that required out of sequence assembly or incremental quality re-work. As a result, the Company has experienced higher levels of inventory and contract assets and lower operational cash flows due to the inability to physically ship and invoice end items to Boeing in a timeframe aligned with production activities. Additionally, during late 2023 the Company was preparing its production line to accommodate an expected increase in production rates for 2024 and beyond. Boeing s ability to increase production rates is governed by the FAA, and the production rates which were anticipated are now limited. During the quarter ended September 26, 2024, the Company continued to experience delays and realized higher than anticipated costs with respect to these production and delivery processes, and anticipates that some level of higher costs will continue in the future. 
 
 On April 18, 2024, the Company entered into a Memorandum of Agreement MOA with Boeing, where Boeing advanced 425.0 to the Company to support the Company s liquidity. This MOA was amended on June 20, 2024, to increase the advance by an additional 40.0 and to revise certain repayment amounts and extend near-term repayment dates. As of the date of this filing, we have repaid 40.0 of the MOA advances; however, the other amounts remain outstanding. We have engaged in discussion with Boeing regarding a second amendment to the MOA, but there can be no assurance that such amendment will be entered into on acceptable terms, if at all. 
 
 On October 18, 2024, we announced a 21-day furlough, effective October 27, 2024, for approximately 700 employees working on the B767 and B777 programs in response to the strike by Boeing employees as the Company has reached maximum storage capacity on the B767 and B777 programs. Our ability to align our costs, including both internal and supply chain related spending, to react to unexpected changes in customer-determined production rates has and will likely continue to have a material impact on the Company s results of operations and cash flows. Our liquidity has been impacted by higher levels of inventory and contract assets, lower operational cash flows due to a decrease in expected deliveries to Boeing, higher factory costs to maintain rate readiness (attributed to product quality verification process enhancements, including moving such processes from Renton, Washington, to Wichita, Kansas), Boeing no longer allowing for traveled work on the B737 fuselage to its factories, the strike by Boeing employees, and limitations on Boeing increasing production rates. Based upon expected production volumes and deliveries, the terms of this advance require installments be repaid through October 2024, which has been deferred. 
 
 Additionally, the Company was in negotiations with Airbus related to pricing adjustments on the A220 and A350 programs during 2023 and continuing into 2024 with a goal of completing those negotiations in early 2024. As a result of the announcement on March 1, 2024, that the Company was engaged in discussions with Boeing about a possible acquisition of the Company by Boeing, followed by the signing of the Merger Agreement and Term Sheet on June 30, 2024, there was a shift in the strategic discussions with Airbus relevant to pricing adjustments on the A220 and A350 programs, most recently with a focus toward customer advances and other accommodations. 
 
 These developments in 2024 resulted in a significant reduction in projected revenue and operating cash flows over the next twelve months. Additionally, although the advances received in 2024 have provided essential operational liquidity, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional advances from our customers, repay current advances on the specified due dates, renegotiate the due date or otherwise obtain additional liquidity as needed under acceptable terms or at all. We will need to obtain additional funding to sustain operations, as we expect to continue generating operating losses for the foreseeable future. 
 
 As of November 5, 2024, management has developed a plan designed to improve liquidity in response to the developments highlighted above. These plans are dependent upon many factors, including, among other things, the outcomes of active discussions related to the timing or amounts of repayment for certain customer advances, the timing and expected proceeds received from certain divestitures, the expected timing and outcome of the Merger Agreement and Term Sheet announced June 30, 2024, achieving anticipated B737 deliveries, and the timing, resolution, and ultimate impact of the strike by Boeing

employees. Management is also evaluating additional strategies intended to improve liquidity to support operations, including, but not limited to, additional customer advances, issuing securities or debt financing subject to any contractual limitations and conditions, including the Merger Agreement, and restructuring of operations in an effort to increase efficiency and decrease expenses, which may include layoffs or additional furloughs. However, there can be no assurance that these plans or strategies will sufficiently improve our liquidity needs or that we will otherwise realize the anticipated benefits. Accordingly, substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern exists. 
 
 These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of the uncertainties described above.

, which included net forward loss charges of , and unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments related to periods prior to the third quarter of 2024 of . The forward losses in the third quarter were primarily driven by current production performance, and supply chain cost growth on the A350 and A220 programs, additional labor and supply chain cost growth on the B787 program, and increased costs related to factory performance on the B767 program. The unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments primarily relate to increased production costs associated with changes implemented by Boeing in March 2024 to introduce a new product verification process in Wichita, KS on the B737 program and current period changes in certain cost allocation methodologies and increased production costs on the B777 program. This change in business process for the B737 units has delayed delivery acceptances and caused a buildup of undelivered units in Wichita, KS. Additionally, the Company is maintaining a higher cost profile for an expected increase in production rates that has now been delayed due to the limitation on Boeing increasing its production rates, and production cost overruns on the A320 program. 
 
 During the third quarter ended September 28, 2023, the Company recognized unfavorable changes in estimates of , which included net forward loss charges of , and unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments related to periods prior to the third quarter of 2023 of . The forward losses in the quarter ended September 28, 2023 were primarily driven by labor and production cost growth on the A350 program, additional labor and supply chain cost growth on the B787 program, increased factory performance and supply chain costs on the B767 program, and production costs incurred on the Sikorsky CH-53K program. The unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments were primarily related to increased factory performance costs and rework costs related to the quality issue on the B737 aft pressure bulkhead on the B737 program, and production cost overruns and foreign currency movements on the A320 program.

 The Company has agreements (through Holdings subsidiaries) to sell, on a revolving basis, certain trade accounts receivable balances with Boeing, Airbus, and Rolls-Royce PLC and its affiliates (collectively, Rolls-Royce to third-party financial institutions. These programs were primarily entered into as a result of customers seeking payment term extensions with the Company and they continue to allow the Company to monetize the receivables prior to their payment date, subject to payment of a discount. No guarantees are delivered under the agreements. The Company s ability to continue using such agreements is primarily dependent upon the strength of the applicable customer s financial condition. Transfers under these agreements are accounted for as sales of receivables resulting in the receivables being derecognized from the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the nine months ended September 26, 2024, of accounts receivable were sold via these arrangements. The proceeds from these sales of receivables are included in cash from operating activities in the

 Contract liabilities ) ) ) Net contract assets (liabilities) 
 
 For the period ended September 26, 2024, the increase in contract assets reflects the net impact of more over time revenue recognition in relation to billed revenues during the period as well as the impact of changes implemented by Boeing in March 2024 to introduce a new product verification process in Wichita, KS. This change in business process has delayed delivery acceptances and caused a buildup of undelivered units in Wichita, KS. The increase in contract liabilities reflects the net impact of more deferred revenues recorded in excess of revenue recognized during the period. The increase in the current period was driven by receipts in both the Commercial and Defense Space segments related to funding for specific program expenditures. The Company recognized of revenue that was included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of the period.

As the Company is currently reporting a pre-tax loss for the nine months ended September 26, 2024, an increase in the effective tax rate results in an increase of income tax benefits while a decrease in the rate results in a reduction of income tax benefits. 
 
 As allowed by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, the Company has filed a claim for a pre-tax employee retention credit of 18.8 for 2020 and 1.0 for 2021. The outstanding pre-tax employee retention credit refund claim as of September 26, 2024 is 3.1. 
 
 The Company s federal audit is conducted under the Internal Revenue Service Compliance Assurance Process CAP program. The Company will continue to participate in the CAP program for 2021 through 2024. The CAP program s objective is to resolve issues in a timely, contemporaneous manner and eliminate the need for a lengthy post-filing examination. The Company has an open tax audit in the Kingdom of Morocco for tax years ending prior to the Company s ownership of the Moroccan legal entity. There are ongoing audits in other jurisdictions that are not material to the financial statements and the Company believes appropriate provisions for all outstanding tax issues have been made for all jurisdictions and years. 
 
 The Company operates under a tax holiday in Malaysia which is effective through September 30, 2024. The tax holiday is conditional upon remaining in good standing with the Malaysia taxing authorities, having at least 20 value-add and at least 30 of employees with diploma/degree in science/technical discipline. The tax benefit impact of this holiday has been 3.4, 3.0, and 3.4 for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The tax benefit for the nine months ended September 26, 2024 was 1.8.

 Indemnification 
 
 The Company has entered into customary indemnification agreements with its directors, and its bylaws and certain executive employment agreements include indemnification and advancement provisions. Under the bylaws and any applicable agreement, the Company agrees to indemnify individuals against claims arising out of events or occurrences related to that individual s service as the Company s agent or the agent of any of its subsidiaries to the fullest extent legally permitted. 
 
 The Company has agreed to indemnify parties for specified liabilities incurred, or that may be incurred, in connection with transactions they have entered into with the Company. The Company is unable to assess the potential number of future claims that may be asserted under these indemnities, nor the amounts thereof (if any). As a result, the Company cannot estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnities and therefore, no liability has been recorded. 
 
 Service and Product Warranties and Extraordinary Rework 
 
 Provisions for estimated expenses related to service and product warranties and certain extraordinary rework are evaluated on a quarterly basis. These costs are accrued and are recorded to unallocated cost of goods sold. These estimates are established using historical information on the nature, frequency, and average cost of warranty claims, including the experience of industry peers. In the case of new development products or new customers, the Company considers other factors including the experience of other entities in the same business and management judgment, among others. Service warranty and extraordinary work is reported in current liabilities and other liabilities on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 The warranty balance presented in the table below includes unresolved warranty claims that are in dispute in regard to their value as well as their contractual liability. The Company estimated the total costs related to some of these claims; however, there is significant uncertainty surrounding the disposition of these disputed claims and as such, the ultimate determination of the provision s adequacy requires significant management judgment. The amount of the specific provisions recorded against disputed warranty claims was as of September 26, 2024 and December 31, 2023. These specific provisions represent the Company s best estimate of probable warranty claims. Should the Company incur higher than expected warranty costs and/or discover new or additional information related to these warranty provisions, the Company may incur additional charges that exceed these recorded provisions. The Company utilized available information to make appropriate assessments, however the Company recognizes that data on actual claims experience is of limited duration and therefore, claims projections are subject to significant judgment. The amount of the reasonably possible disputed warranty claims in excess of the specific warranty provision was as of September 26, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 principal segments: Commercial, Defense Space and Aftermarket. Approximately and of the Company s net revenues for the three and nine months ended September 26, 2024 came from the Company s two largest customers, Boeing and Airbus. Boeing represents a substantial portion of the Company s revenues across segments. Airbus represents a substantial portion of revenues in the Commercial segment. The Company s primary profitability measure to review a segment s operating performance is segment operating income before corporate selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development. 
 
 Corporate selling, general and administrative expenses include centralized functions such as accounting, treasury and human resources that are not specifically related to the Company s operating segments and are not allocated in measuring the operating segments profitability and performance and net profit margins. Research and development includes research and development efforts that benefit the Company as a whole and are not unique to a specific segment. These items are not specifically related to the Company s operating segments and are not utilized in measuring the operating segments profitability and performance. 
 
 The Company s Commercial segment includes design and manufacturing of forward, mid, and rear fuselage sections and systems, struts/pylons, nacelles (including thrust reversers) and related engine structural components, wings, and wing components (including flight control surfaces), as well as other miscellaneous structural parts for large commercial aircraft and/or business/regional jets. Sales from this segment are primarily to the aircraft OEMs or engine OEMs of large commercial aircraft and/or business/regional jet programs. The Commercial segment manufactures products at the Company s facilities in Wichita, Kansas; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Kinston, North Carolina; Prestwick, Scotland; Casablanca, Morocco; Belfast, Northern Ireland; and Subang, Malaysia. The Commercial segment also includes an assembly plant for the A350 XWB aircraft in Saint-Nazaire, France. 
 
 The Company s Defense Space segment includes design and manufacturing of fuselage, strut, nacelle, and wing aerostructures (primarily) for U.S. Government defense programs, including Boeing P-8 and KC-46 Tanker, which are commercial aircraft that are modified for military use. The segment also includes fabrication, bonding, assembly, testing tooling, processing, engineering analysis, and training on fixed wing aircraft aerostructures, missiles and hypersonics work, including solid rocket motor throats and nozzles and re-entry vehicle thermal protections systems, forward cockpit and cabin, and fuselage work on rotorcraft aerostructures. Sales from this segment are primarily to the prime contractors on various U.S. Government defense program contracts for which the Company is a sub-contractor. A significant portion of the Company s Defense Space segment revenues are represented by defense business that is classified by the U.S. Government and cannot be specifically described. The Defense Space segment manufactures products at the Company s facilities in Wichita, KS; Tulsa, OK; Biddeford, ME; Woonsocket, RI; Belfast, Northern Ireland; and Prestwick, Scotland. 
 
 The Company s Aftermarket segment includes design, manufacturing, and marketing of spare parts and maintenance, repair, and overhaul MRO services, repairs for flight control surfaces and nacelles, radome repairs, rotable assets, engineering services, advanced composite repair, and other repair and overhaul services.

 (U.S. Dollars in millions other than per share amounts) 

The Aftermarket segment manufactures products at the Company's facilities in Wichita, KS; Tulsa, OK; Kinston, North Carolina; Dallas, TX; Prestwick, Scotland; Casablanca, Morocco; and Belfast, Northern Ireland. 
 
 The Company s segments are consistent with the organization and responsibilities of management reporting to the chief operating decision-maker for the purpose of assessing performance. The Company s definition of segment operating income differs from Operating income as presented in its primary financial statements and a reconciliation of the segment and consolidated results is provided in the table set forth below. 
 
 While some working capital accounts are maintained on a segment basis, much of the Company s assets are not managed or maintained on a segment basis. Property, plant, and equipment, including tooling, is used in the design and production of products for each of the segments and, therefore, is not allocated to any individual segment. In addition, cash, prepaid expenses, other assets, and deferred taxes are managed and maintained on a consolidated basis and generally do not pertain to any particular segment. Raw materials and certain component parts are used in aerostructure production across all segments. Work-in-process inventory is identifiable by segment but is managed and evaluated at the program level. As there is no segmentation of the Company s productive assets, depreciation expense (included in fixed manufacturing costs and selling, general and administrative expenses) and capital expenditures, no allocation of these amounts has been made solely for purposes of segment disclosure requirements. 
 
 The following table shows segment revenues and operating income (loss) for the nine months ended September 26, 2024 and September 28, 2023:

References to Spirit refer only to our subsidiary, Spirit AeroSystems, Inc., and references to Holdings refer only to Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. 

Global Economic Conditions 
 
 Global economic conditions impact our results of operations. Our business operations depend on, among other things, sufficient OEM orders (without suspension) from airlines and the financial resources of airlines, our suppliers, other companies and individuals. 
 
 Energy, freight, raw material and other costs have been impacted by, and may continue to be impacted by, the war in Ukraine. Prolonged global inflationary pressures have also impacted these costs in addition to increased interest costs and labor costs. In certain situations, we have the ability to recover certain abnormal inflationary impacts through contractual agreements with our customers; however, we anticipate that we will experience reduced levels of profitability related to inflationary impacts until such time as the rate of inflation subsides to normal historical levels. Our associated estimates of such costs, where applicable, use the most recent information available. The economic impact of inflation, together with the impact of increases in interest rates and actions taken to attempt to reduce inflation, may have a significant effect on the global economy, air travel, our supply chain and our customers, and, as a result, on our business. 
 
 In addition, Russia s invasion of Ukraine, the resultant sanctions and other measures imposed by the U.S. and other governments, and other related impacts have resulted in economic and political uncertainty and risks. In response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the associated U.S. sanctions, the Company suspended all sanctioned activities relating to Russia, primarily consisting of sales and service activities. The suspended activities impacts to prospective revenues, net income, net assets, cash flow from operations, and the Company s Consolidated Financial Position are not material. Continuation or significant expansion of economic disruption or escalation of the conflict, or other geopolitical events of a similar nature, such as the conflict in the Middle East, could have a material adverse effect on orders from our customers, the public s ability or willingness to continue to travel, the availability and timeliness of certain elements of parts procured from our supply chain, and/or our results of operations. 
 
 We expect that our operating environment will continue to remain dynamic and evolve through 2024. We continue to monitor and evaluate related risks and uncertainties relating to macroeconomic conditions, including the items discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on February 22, 2024 (the 2023 Form 10-K and in Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part II of this Quarterly Report. 
 
 On September 12, 2024, machinists at Boeing represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers IAM voted to strike after rejecting a contract offer from Boeing. The machinists commenced a strike on September 13, 2024, that was resolved on November 4, 2024, when the machinists voted to approve a new contract. On October 18, 2024, we announced a three week furlough for approximately 700 employees on programs that had reached maximum storage capacity. Even as the strike has ended, we are evaluating various additional options intended to mitigate the overall financial impact of the strike. We are currently unable to fully estimate what impact the strike will have on the Company s near or long-term financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 Agreement and Plan of Merger with The Boeing Company 
 
 On June 30, 2024, Holdings entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement with The Boeing Company Boeing and Sphere Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Boeing Merger Sub ).

 The Merger Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants of Holdings, Boeing and Merger Sub, including covenants restricting Holdings from soliciting alternative acquisition proposals, governing the conduct of the Company s business during the period between the date of the Merger Agreement and completion of the Merger and relating to the parties efforts to consummate the Merger as promptly as reasonably practicable. The Merger Agreement includes provisions to facilitate the disposition by the Company to Airbus SE and its affiliates Airbus of the Spirit Airbus Business, as contemplated by a term sheet between Spirit and Airbus SE (the Airbus Term Sheet described below under the sub-heading Airbus Term Sheet . The Merger Agreement also includes provisions, which are consistent with provisions in the Airbus Term Sheet, to facilitate the potential sale, subject to certain Boeing consent rights, by the Company to other third parties of specified assets and businesses, some of which include or comprise parts of the Spirit Airbus Business. Such specified assets and businesses include, among others, the Company s operations in Belfast, Northern Ireland (other than the operations that are part of the Spirit Airbus Business) and Subang, Malaysia, certain of the Company s operations in Prestwick, Scotland and the Company s Fiber Materials, Inc. business. 
 
 The Merger Agreement includes termination provisions under which either Holdings or Boeing may terminate the Merger Agreement in various circumstances, including if the Merger has not been consummated by March 31, 2025, subject to three automatic three-month extensions if on each such date all of the closing conditions except those relating to regulatory approvals or the disposition of the Spirit Airbus Business have been satisfied or waived (such date, as so extended (if applicable), the Outside Date ). Upon termination of the Merger Agreement in specified circumstances, Holdings would be required to pay to Boeing a termination fee of 150.0 million. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement in other specified circumstances, Boeing would be required to pay to Holdings a termination fee of 300.0 million reduced (but not to less than zero) by the aggregate then-outstanding amount of cash advances to be repaid by the Company to Boeing, whether or not then due and payable, pursuant to the applicable agreements governing cash advances by Boeing to the Company. 
 
 Subject to satisfaction of the closing conditions in the Merger Agreement, the closing of the Merger is expected to occur in mid-2025. 
 
 In connection with the proposed merger, Spirit and Boeing have each received a request for additional information second request from the Federal Trade Commission as part of the regulatory review process under the HSR Act. The second request extends the waiting period imposed by the HSR Act until 30 days after Spirit and Boeing have substantially complied with the requests or the waiting period is terminated sooner by the Federal Trade Commission.

 Spirit and Airbus entered into the Airbus Term Sheet on June 30, 2024. The Airbus Term Sheet is a binding term sheet under which the parties have agreed to negotiate in good faith definitive agreements (the Definitive Agreements ), including a purchase agreement, providing for the acquisition by Airbus or its affiliates of the Spirit Airbus Business on the terms set forth in the Airbus Term Sheet with the goal of permitting Boeing and Holdings to consummate the Merger prior to the Outside Date.

 B737 Program 
 
 The B737 MAX program is a critical program to the Company. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 approximately 45 , 45 , and 35 of our net revenues, respectively, were generated from sales of components to Boeing for the B737 aircraft, as compared to 53 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, which was the most recent period to exclude impacts from the B737 MAX grounding and the COVID-19 pandemic. While we have entered into long-term supply agreements with Boeing to continue to provide components for the B737 for the life of the aircraft program, including commercial and military P-8 derivatives, Boeing does not have any obligation to purchase components from us for any replacement for the B737 that is not a commercial derivative model as defined by the Special Business Provisions and the General Terms Agreement (collectively, the Sustaining Agreement between Spirit and Boeing. The Sustaining Agreement is a requirements contract and Boeing can reduce the purchase volume at any time.

 In March 2019, the B737 MAX fleet was grounded in the U.S. and internationally following the 2018 and 2019 accidents involving two B737 MAX aircraft. In November 2020, the Federal Aviation Administration (the FAA issued an order rescinding the grounding of the B737 MAX and published an Airworthiness Directive specifying design changes to be made before the aircraft returned to service. Boeing s deliveries of the B737 MAX resumed in the fourth quarter of 2020. Since November 2020, regulators from Brazil, Canada, China the EU, U.K., India, and other countries have taken similar actions to unground the B737 MAX and permit return to service. During the six months ended June 27, 2024, Boeing continued to announce orders for the B737 MAX. 
 
 We expect that the B737 MAX and other narrowbody production rates will recover to pre-pandemic levels before widebody production rates. For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 The B737 MAX 7 and MAX 10 models are currently going through FAA certification activities. In December 2022, an extension for certification of these two models to December 31, 2024 was granted when the U.S. Congress passed the Fiscal Year 2023 Omnibus Appropriations Bill. In early 2024, Boeing communicated that it has pledged to develop new engine inlets for the B737 MAX to rectify overheating issues observed with the current engine inlets when the anti-ice system is activated under specific conditions. Boeing anticipates this activity will be completed in approximately one year. If Boeing is unable to achieve certification of these models or the entry into service is inconsistent with current assumptions, future revenues, earnings, and cash flows are likely to be adversely impacted. 
 
 The B737 MAX 9 derivative fleet was temporarily grounded by the FAA while certain safety inspections were completed and to allow the FAA time to review any required maintenance actions following the January 5, 2024 in-flight incident on a B737 MAX 9 aircraft flown by Alaska Airlines. The B737 MAX 9 fleet returned to service on January 26, 2024 after mandatory inspections were completed. We are participating in investigations relating to this incident. For additional information, see Note 19 Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees. 
 
 Certain changes made to the production and delivery process implemented by Boeing have had an immediate impact to our results of operations and cash flows. On March 2, 2024, Boeing announced they would no longer accept deliveries of product that required out of sequence assembly or incremental quality re-work. A new product verification process has been implemented by Boeing at our factory in Wichita, KS. 
 
 B787 Progra m 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2021, the combination of production rate decreases from our customer and estimated costs of rework and engineering changes resulted in incremental forward loss charges of 153.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2022, our estimates for further production rate decreases and build schedule changes, supply chain costs, and other costs, including costs of rework, drove additional forward loss charges of 93.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2023, our estimates related to the impact of the IAM agreement, additional labor and supply chain cost growth drove additional forward loss charges of 93.0 million recognized through the quarter ended September 29, 2023. On October 12, 2023, we executed a Memorandum of Agreement with Boeing (the 2023 MOA ), where, among other items, we established recurring shipset price increases effective for line unit 1164 through line unit 1605 with a mutual goal of concluding good faith pricing negotiations, other interests and considerations 12 months prior to the delivery of line unit 1605, which based on the latest schedule is anticipated in March, 2028. As a result, we reversed previously recognized forward loss charges of 205.6 million and also reversed a previously recognized material right obligation of 154.6 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2023. See also Note 19, Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees . For the nine months ended September 26, 2024, our updated estimates drove an additional 316.0 million of forward loss primarily related to schedule changes, additional labor and supply chain cost growth. Additional production rate changes, changes in cost assessments, claims, labor work stoppages, supply chain cost changes, or changes to the scope of quality issues and any associated rework, could result in an incremental loss provision. 
 
 Airbus Programs 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2021, the A350 program recorded forward loss charges of 55.2 million related to customer driven production rate changes and quality-related costs. The A350 program recorded additional forward loss charges of 105.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 related to estimated quality-related costs, non-recurring engineering and tooling costs, and additional labor, freight, and other cost requirements driven by parts shortages, production and quality issues, and customer production rate changes. The A350 program recorded additional forward loss charges of 121.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 related to labor and production cost growth, higher supply chain costs and schedule revisions. For the nine months ended September 26, 2024, our updated estimates drove 296.8 million of incremental estimated forward loss on the A350 program, driven primarily by a change in strategic pricing conversations with our customer, Airbus, incremental orders Airbus secured, and the impact of factory performance and supply chain cost growth.

The A220 wing program recorded additional forward losses of 25 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily related to the bankruptcy of a supplier and associated failure of the supplier to deliver key parts on the program. The A220 program recorded additional forward losses of 164.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily related to higher production, labor and supply chain costs. For the nine months ended September 26, 2024, our updated estimates drove 255.9 million of incremental estimated forward loss on the A220 program, driven by a change in strategic pricing conversations with our customer, Airbus, incremental orders Airbus secured, and increased production and supply chain costs.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Goodwill 
 
 Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually on the first day of the fourth quarter, or whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2023, in accordance with our annual assessment policy, we opted to bypass the qualitative assessment and performed a quantitative assessment to test goodwill for impairment. 
 
 As part of our impairment assessment, we utilized a third-party to assist us with estimating the fair value of each of our respective reporting units under both the income approach and the market approach with equal weighing applied to the results of each approach. These approaches require making assumptions regarding long-term growth rates, revenue and earnings projections, estimation of cash flows, discount rates, and market and company-specific factors. 
 
 The results of our annual assessment indicated that the fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value for each reporting unit, and as a result, no impairment existed as of the annual assessment date during the fourth quarter of 2023. Further, we have not identified any indications of impairment that would prompt an interim impairment assessment for the quarter ended September 26, 2024.

 Changes in Estimates 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we recognized unfavorable changes in estimates of 242.9 million, which included net forward loss charges of 217.2 million, and unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments related to periods prior to the third quarter of 2024 of 25.7 million. The forward losses in the third quarter were primarily driven by current production performance, and supply chain cost growth on the A350 and A220 programs, additional labor and supply chain cost growth on the B787 program, and increased costs related to factory performance on the B767 program. The unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments primarily relate to increased production costs associated with changes implemented by Boeing in March 2024 to introduce a new product verification process in Wichita, KS on the B737 program and schedule changes and increased production costs on the B777 program. This change in business process for the B737 units has delayed delivery acceptances and caused a buildup of undelivered units in Wichita, KS. Additionally, we are maintaining a higher cost profile for a planned rate increase that has now been delayed because of the production rate limitations on the B737 program, and production cost overruns on the A320 program. A s referenced above, we utilize a periodic forecasting process to assess the progress and performance of our programs. We may continue to experience forward losses in the future as a result of production schedule impacts from our customers, increases in costs related to persistent inflation, or other factors resulting in cost estimates higher than our original forecast. 
 
 During the same period in the prior year, we recognized total unfavorable changes in estimates of 165.1 million, which included net forward loss charges of 101.1 million, and unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments related to periods prior to the third quarter of 2023 of 64.0 million.

 Three Months Ended September 26, 2024 as Compared to Three Months Ended September 28, 2023 
 
 Revenue. Net revenue for the three months ended September 26, 2024 was 1,470.6 million, an increase of 31.7 million, or 2.2 , compared to net revenue of 1,438.9 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by increased Commercial production across most programs partially offset by lower B737 production volume, and increased Defense Space production . Approximately 78 and 81 of Spirit s net revenues for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively, came from our two largest customers, Boeing and Airbus. 
 
 Total deliveries to Boeing decreased to 88 shipsets during the third quarter of 2024, compared to 108 shipsets delivered in the same period of the prior year, primarily driven by delivery delays caused by increased quality and final inspection measures undertaken by Boeing. Total deliveries to Airbus increased to 178 shipsets during the third quarter of 2024, compared to 165 shipsets delivered in the same period of the prior year, primarily driven b y increases in A320, A220 and A350 deliveries . Deliveries for business/regional jet components increased to 66 shipsets delivered during the third quarter of 2024, compared to 59 shipsets delivered in the same period of the prior year. In total, deliveries were flat at 332 shipsets during the third quarter of 2024, compared to 332 shipsets delivered in the same period of the prior year. 
 
 Gross (Loss) Profit . Gross loss was 246.0) million for the three months ended September 26, 2024, compared to gross loss of 53.6) million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in loss from the prior year period was primarily driven by higher excess capacity costs and higher forward losses, as detailed below. In the third quarter of 2024, we recognized 70.1 million of excess capacity production costs driven by cost overruns and production schedule changes on B737 MAX and A220 programs, compared to excess capacity cost of 56.4 million in the same period of the prior year. In the third quarter of 2024, we recognized 25.7 million of unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments related to periods prior to the third quarter of 2024, and 217.2 million of net forward loss charges. As mentioned in the Note 3 Changes in Estimates to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I of this Quarterly Report, the forward losses recorded in the third quarter of 2024 were primarily driven by current production performance, and supply chain cost growth on the A350 and A220 programs, additional labor and supply chain cost growth on the B787 program, and increased costs related to factory performance on the B767 program. In the third quarter of 2023, we recorded 64.0 million of unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments related to periods prior to the third quarter of 2023, and 101.1 million of net forward loss charges primarily driven by labor and production cost growth on the A350 program, additional labor and supply chain cost growth on the B787 program, increased factory performance and supply chain costs on the B767 program, and production costs incurred including the impact of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers IAM agreement on the Sikorsky CH-53K program. 
 
 SG A and Research and Development. Current period SG A was higher than in the prior year period by 24.6 million, primarily due to increased purchased services for merger related activities and certain employee retention-related expenditures outlined in the Merger Agreement of 5.4 million. Research and development expenses were essentially flat for the three months ended September 26, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 
 Operating (Loss) Income. Operating loss for the three months ended September 26, 2024 was 350.1) million, an increase of 216.4 million, compared to operating loss of 133.7) million for the same period in the prior year. The variance reflects the higher excess capacity costs and higher forward losses detailed above. 
 
 Interest Expense and Financing Fee Amortization. Interest expense and financing fee amortization for the three months ended September 26, 2024 increased 15.7 million compared to the same period in the prior year, driven by the higher interest rate on the Second Lien 2030 Notes compared to the refinanced Second Lien 2025 Notes, the addition of the Exchangeable Senior Notes and the addition of the Bridge Credit Agreement . The three months ended September 26, 2024 includes 81.2 million of interest and fees paid or accrued in connection with long-term debt and 6.5 million in amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount, compared to 70.1 million of interest and fees paid or accrued in connection with long-term debt and 2.9 million in amortiz ation of deferred financing costs and original issue discount for the same period in the prior year. See also Note 14 Debt to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I of this Quarterly Report. 
 
 Other Income (Expense), net. Other expense, net for the three months ended September 26, 2024 was 33.0) million, compared to other income of 7.3 million for the same period in the prior year, a decrease in income of 40.3 million. The decrease in other income was primarily due to foreign currency losses of 28.0) million recognized in the current period, versus gains of 12.9 million in the same period of the prior year. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes . Our reported tax rate includes two principal components: an expected annual tax rate and discrete items resulting in additional provisions or benefits that are recorded in the quarter that an event arises. Events or items that could give rise to discrete recognition include excess tax benefit in respect of share-based compensation, finalizing audit examinations for open tax years, statute of limitations expiration, or a change in tax law.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future income tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts for existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred income tax assets to an amount that in management s opinion will ultimately be realized. We have reviewed our material deferred tax assets to determine whether or not a valuation allowance was necessary. Based on evaluation of both the positive and negative evidence available, management determined that it was necessary to continue to maintain a valuation allowance against nearly all of its net U.S. and U.K. deferred tax assets as of September 26, 2024. The net valuation allowance was increased by 84.4 million in the U.S. and by 33.2 million in the U.K. for the three months ended September 26, 2024. 
 
 The income tax provision for the three months ended September 26, 2024 includes 0.1 million for federal taxes, 2.6 million for state taxes and 0.1 million for foreign taxes. The income tax provision for the three months ended September 28, 2023 includes 6.7) million for federal taxes, 3.7 million for state taxes and 5.4 million for foreign taxes. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 26, 2024 is (0.60 as compared to (1.19 for the same period in 2023. As we are reporting a pre-tax loss for the three months ended September 26, 2024, an increase in the effective tax rate results in an increase of income tax benefits while a decrease in the rate results in a reduction of income tax benefits. 
 
 The decrease from the U.S. statutory tax rate is attributable primarily to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. 
 
 Merger Agreement . Other than transaction expenses associated with the Merger of 28.8 million, the Merger Agreement did not affect the Company s consolidated financial statements for the three months ended September 26, 2024. 
 
 Segments. The following table shows segment revenues and operating loss for the three months ended September 26, 2024 and September 28, 2023:

 Commercial segment, Defense Space segment, and Aftermarket segment represented approximately 78 , 16 , and 7 , respectively, of our net revenues for the three months ended September 26, 2024 and approximately 79 , 14 , and 7 , respectively, of our net revenues for the three months ended September 28, 2023. 
 
 Commercial segment. Commercial segment net revenues for the three months ended September 26, 2024 were 1,139.8 million, an increase of 3.4 million, or 0 , compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in revenues was primarily driven by higher production across most programs, partially offset by lower production volume on the B737 program. 
 
 Commercial segment operating margins were (26 for the three months ended September 26, 2024, compared to (7 for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in margin for the three months ended September 26, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, was primarily due to higher unfavorable changes in estimates recorded in the current period . In the third quarter of 2024, the segment recorded unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of 37.5 million and net forward loss charges of 212.9 million. In comparison, during the third quarter of 2023, the segment recorded unfavorable cumulative catch-

 up adjustments of 59.1 million and net forward loss charges of 86.5 million. For the three months ended September 26, 2024, the Commercial segment included 65.8 million of excess capacity production costs and restructuring costs of 0.1) million, compared with excess capacity costs of 54.3 million, costs of 0.8 million related to temporary production pause, and restructuring costs of 0.0 million for the same period in the prior year. 
 
 Defense Space segment. Defense Space segment net revenues for the three months ended September 26, 2024 were 231.3 million, an increase of 25.6 million, or 12 , compared to the same period in the prior year. The variance from the prior year period includes the impact of additional revenues from higher activity on development programs, higher production on the Sikorsky CH-53K and progress on classified programs partially offset by decreased revenue on P-8 units under the Boeing B737 program, the contracts for which include units produced for the Boeing P-8 program that are accounted for in the Defense Space segment. Additionally, we recognized non-recurring revenues on the FLRAA program associated with Spirit s closeout of the program. 
 
 Defense Space segment operating margins increased to 19 for the three months ended September 26, 2024, compared to 5 for the same period in the prior year. The increase in margin over the prior year period was primarily due to higher revenues and margin on Sikorsky CH-53K and classified programs, as well as the non-recurring revenues mentioned above, partially offset by increased costs on the Boeing P-8 program resulting from the impacts of Boeing s changes to the quality inspection process and schedule changes. F or the three months ended September 26, 2024 the Defense Space segment included 4.3 million of excess capacity production costs and restructuring costs of 0.0 million, compared with compared with excess capacity costs of 2.1 million. The segment recorded favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of 11.8 million for the three months ended September 26, 2024. The segment recorded net forward loss charges of 4.3 million for the three months ended September 26, 2024. In comparison, during the same period of the prior year, the segment recorded unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of 4.9 million and net forward loss charges of 14.6 million. 
 
 Aftermarket segment. Aftermarket segment net revenues for the three months ended September 26, 2024 were 99.5 million, an increase of 2.7 million, or 3 , compared to the same period in the prior year. Aftermarket segment operating margins were 9 for the three months ended September 26, 2024, compared to 18 for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in margins was driven primarily by increased spares volume . 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 26, 2024 as Compared to Nine Months Ended September 28, 2023 
 
 Revenue . Net revenue for the nine months ended September 26, 2024 was 4,665.3 million, an increase of 430.3 million, or 10.2 , compared to net revenue of 4,235.0 million in the same period in the prior year. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by increased Boeing and Airbus production, and increased Defense Space production . Approximately 81 and 82 of the Company s net revenues for the nine months ended September 26, 2024 and September 28, 2023, respectively, came from our two largest customers, Boeing and Airbus. 
 
 Total deliveries to Boeing decreased to 216 shipsets during the nine months ended September 26, 2024, compared to 324 shipsets delivered in the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by delivery delays caused by increased quality and final inspection measures undertaken by Boeing. Total deliveries to Airbus increased to 594 shipsets during the nine months ended September 26, 2024, compared to 529 shipsets delivered in the same period in the prior year, primarily driven b y increases in A320, A220 and A350 deliveries. D eliveries for business/regional jet components decreased to 165 shipsets during the nine months ended September 26, 2024, compared to 167 deliveries in the same period in the prior year. In total, deliveries decreased to 975 shipsets during the nine months ended September 26, 2024, compared to 1,020 shipsets delivered in the same period of the prior year. 
 
 Gross (Loss) Profit . Gross loss was 915.0) million for the nine months ended September 26, 2024, compared to gross loss of 85.2) million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in loss over the same period of the prior year was primarily driven by higher unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments and higher forward losses, as detailed below . In the nine months ended September 26, 2024, we recognized 142.5 million of excess capacity production costs driven by cost overruns and production schedule changes on B737 MAX and A220 programs, compared to excess capacity production costs of 152.9 million in the same period of the prior year. In the nine months ended September 26, 2024, the Company recognized 78.1 million of unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments related to periods prior to the nine months ended September 26, 2024, and 926.1 million of net forward loss charges. The forward losses recorded in the period were primarily driven by a change in strategic pricing conversations with our customer, Airbus, incremental orders Airbus secured, current production performance, and supply chain cost growth on the A350 and A220 programs, schedule changes, additional labor and supply chain cost growth on the B787 program, and increased costs related to factory performance and supply chain cost growth on the B767 program. In the nine months ended September 28, 2023, the Company recorded 49.4 million of unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments related to periods prior to the nine months ended September 28, 2023, and 315.8 million of net forward loss charges. The forward losses recorded in the nine months ended September 28, 2023 were primarily driven by labor and

 production cost growth, higher supply chain costs, and schedule revisions on the A350 program and additional labor, the impact of the IAM agreement and supply chain cost growth on the B787 program, increased factory performance and supply chain costs on the B767 program, and production costs incurred including the impact of the IAM agreement on the Sikorsky CH-53K program . The total gross loss impact related to the IAM agreement in the nine months ended September 28, 2023 was 35.6 million. 
 
 SG A and Research and Development . SG A expense was 41.7 million higher for the nine months ended September 26, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year. The variance was driven by increased purchased services for merger related activities and certain employee retention-related expenditures outlined in the Merger Agreement of 5.4 million. Greater research and development activity drove research and development expense 0.5 million higher for the nine months ended September 26, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 
 Restructuring Costs . Restructuring costs of 0.7 million were recorded for the nine months ended September 26, 2024, driven by a reduction in hourly production workforce in an effort to align the workforce to current production rates . Restructuring costs of 7.2 million were recorded during the nine months ended September 28, 2023, driven by the results of the voluntary separation program . 
 
 Operating (Loss) Income . Operating loss for the nine months ended September 26, 2024 was 1,209.0) million, an increase of 859.8, compared to the operating loss of 349.2) million for the same period in the prior year. The increase reflects higher unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments and higher forward losses detailed above. 
 
 Interest Expense and Financing Fee Amortization . Interest expense and financing fee amortization for the nine months ended September 26, 2024 increased 32.2 million compared to the same period of the prior year, driven by the higher interest rate on the Second Lien 2030 Notes compared to the refinanced Second Lien 2025 Notes, the addition of the Exchangeable Senior Notes, and the addition of the Bridge Credit Agreement. The nine months ended September 26, 2024 includes 231.1 million of interest and fees paid or accrued in connection with long-term debt and 12.2 million in amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount, compared to 208.0 million of interest and fees paid or accrued in connection with long-term debt and 8.6 million in amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount for the same period in the prior year. See also Note 14 Debt . 
 
 Other Income (Expense), net . Other expense for the nine months ended September 26, 2024 was 30.3) million, compared to other expense of 120.0) million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in other expense was primarily due to net pension related income in the current year period of 11.2 million versus net pension related expense of 59.0) million in the prior year period as well as excise tax expense of 35.9) million in the prior year period. In addition, we recorded higher foreign currency losses of 24.1) million recognized in the current period, versus losses of 0.4) million in the same period of the prior year. The respective pension expense value for 2023 was driven by special accounting impacts related to pension plan termination activities. See also Note 15 Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I of this Quarterly Report. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes . Our reported tax rate includes two principal components: an expected annual tax rate and discrete items resulting in additional provisions or benefits that are recorded in the quarter that an event arises. Events or items that could give rise to discrete recognition include excess tax benefit in respect of share-based compensation, finalizing audit examinations for open tax years, statute of limitations expiration, or a change in tax law. 
 
 Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future income tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts for existing asset and liabilities and their respective tax bases. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred income tax assets to an amount that in management's opinion will ultimately be realized. We have reviewed our material deferred tax assets to determine whether or not a valuation allowance was necessary. Based on evaluation of both the positive and negative evidence available, management determined that it was necessary to continue to maintain a valuation allowance against nearly all of its net U.S. and U.K. deferred tax assets as of September 26, 2024. The net valuation allowance increased by 255.4 million in the U.S. and by 118.9 million in the U.K. for the nine months ended September 26, 2024. 
 
 The income tax provision for the nine months ended September 26, 2024 includes 2.5 million for federal taxes, 2.0 million for state taxes, and 11.4 million for foreign taxes. The income tax provision for the nine months ended September 28, 2023 includes 10.9) million for federal taxes, 1.1 million for state taxes, and 10.9 million for foreign taxes. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 26, 2024 is (1.07 as compared to the (0.16 for the same period in the prior year. As we are reporting a pre-tax loss for the nine months ended September 26, 2024, an increase in the effective tax rate results in an increase of income tax benefits while a decrease in the rate results in a reduction of income tax benefits.

 The decrease from the U.S. statutory rate is attributable primarily to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. 
 
 Merger Agreement. Other than transaction expenses associated with the Merger of 46.8 million, the Merger Agreement did not affect the Company s consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 26, 2024. 
 
 Segments . The following table shows segment revenues and operating loss for the nine months ended September 26, 2024 and September 28, 2023: 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 26, 2024 September 28, 2023 in millions) Segment Revenues Commercial 3,662.3 3,367.9 Defense Space 706.5 583.7 Aftermarket 296.5 283.4 4,665.3 4,235.0 Segment Operating Income (Loss) Commercial (1,054.8) (200.5) Defense Space 95.7 41.0 Aftermarket 43.4 61.4 (915.7) (98.1) SG A (258.9) (217.2) Research and development (34.4) (33.9) Total operating loss (1,209.0) (349.2) 
 
 Commercial segment, Defense Space segment, and Aftermarket segment represented approximately 79 , 15 , and 6 , respectively, of our net revenues for the nine months ended September 26, 2024, and approximately 80 , 14 , and 7 , respectively, of our net revenues for the nine months ended September 28, 2023. 
 
 Commercial segment . Commercial segment net revenues for the nine months ended September 26, 2024 were 3,662.3 million, an increase of 294.4 million, or 9 , compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in revenues was primarily driven by increased Boeing and Airbus production in the current period. 
 
 Commercial segment operating margins were (29 for the nine months ended September 26, 2024, compared to (6 for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in margin, compared to the same period in the prior year, was driven by higher unfavorable changes in estimates recorded in the current period . For the nine months ended September 26, 2024, the Commercial segment includes 135.0 million of excess capacity production costs and 0.7 million of restructuring costs, compared with excess capacity production costs of 147.0 million, costs of 7.9 million related to temporary production pause, and 6.3 million of restructuring costs for the same period in the prior year. For the nine months ended September 26, 2024, the segment recorded unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of 89.0 million and net forward loss charges of 918.9 million. In comparison, for the nine months ended September 28, 2023, the segment recorded unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of 40.7 million and net forward loss charges of 298.3 million. 
 
 Defense Space . Defense Space segment net revenues for the nine months ended September 26, 2024 were 706.5 million, an increase of 122.8 million, or 21 , compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in revenues from the prior year period includes the impact of additional revenues from higher activity on development programs, higher production on the Sikorsky CH-53K and FLRAA programs and progress on classified programs partially offset by decreased production of P-8 units under the Boeing B737 program, the contracts for which include units produced for the Boeing P-8 program that are accounted for in the Defense Space segment. Additionally, we recognized non-recurring revenues on the FLRAA program associated with Spirit s closeout of the program. 
 
 Defense Space segment operating margins were 14 for the nine months ended September 26, 2024, compared to 7 for the same period in the prior year. The increase in margin, compared to the same period in the prior year, was primarily due to higher revenues and margin on the Sikorsky CH-53K program and classified programs, as well as the non-recurring revenues mentioned above, partially offset by increased costs on the Boeing P-8 program resulting from the impacts of Boeing s changes

 to the quality inspection process and schedule changes. F or the nine months ended September 26, 2024, the Defense Space segment includes 7.5 million of excess capacity production costs, compared with excess capacity production costs of 5.9 million, costs of 0.2 million related to temporary production pause, and 0.9 million of restructuring costs for the same period in the prior year. For the nine months ended September 26, 2024, the segment recorded favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of 10.9 million and net forward loss charges of 7.2 million. In comparison, for the nine months ended September 28, 2023, the segment recorded unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of 8.7 million and net forward loss charges of 17.5 million. 
 
 Aftermarket . Aftermarket segment net revenues for the nine months ended September 26, 2024 were 296.5 million, an increase of 13.1 million, or 5 , compared to the same period in the prior year. Aftermarket segment operating margins were 15 for the nine months ended September 26, 2024, compared to 22 for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in margin, compared to the same period in the prior year, was primarily driven by increased spares volume and lower MRO activity. For the nine months ended September 28, 2023, the Aftermarket segment included 2.4 of benefit from the settlement of a contingent consideration obligation related to a prior year acquisition. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. Our principal sources of liquidity are operating cash flows from continuing operations and borrowings to finance our business operations. 
 
 These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) on a going concern basis, which assumes the Company will be able to continue as a going concern and contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern exists. We have incurred net losses of 1,508.9 million, 616.2 million, 545.7 million, and 540.8 million, for the nine months ended September 26, 2024, and the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, and cash used in operating activities of 1,257.5 million, 225.8 million, 394.6 million, and 63.2 million, respectively for the same periods. As of September 26, 2024 , our debt balance was 4,402.6 million, including 426.2 million of debt classified as short-term. Our cash and cash equivalents were 217.6 million and 823.5 million as of September 26, 2024 , and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company will require additional liquidity to continue its operations over the next 12 months. 
 
 Further, certain changes made to the production and delivery process implemented by Boeing have had an immediate impact on our results of operations and cash flows. On March 2, 2024, Boeing announced they would no longer accept deliveries of product that required out of sequence assembly or incremental quality re-work. As a result, we have experienced higher levels of inventory and contract assets and lower operational cash flows due to the inability to physically ship and invoice end items to Boeing in a timeframe aligned with production activities. Additionally, during late 2023 we were preparing our production line to accommodate an expected increase in production rates for 2024 and beyond. Boeing s ability to increase production rates is governed by the FAA, and the production rates which were anticipated are now limited. During the quarter ended September 26, 2024, the Company continued to experience delays and realized higher than anticipated costs with respect to these production and delivery processes, and anticipates that some level of higher costs will continue in the future. 
 
 On April 18, 2024, we entered into a Memorandum of Agreement MOA with Boeing, where Boeing advanced 425.0 million to us to support our liquidity. This MOA was amended on June 20, 2024, to increase the advance by an additional 40.0 million and to revise certain repayment amounts and extend near-term repayment dates. As of the date of this filing, we have repaid 40.0 million of the MOA advances; however, the other amounts remain outstanding. We have engaged in discussion with Boeing regarding a second amendment to the MOA, but there can be no assurance that such amendment will be entered into on acceptable terms, if at all. While we made consistent progress in the expected amount of time required to execute the new production and delivery processes highlighted above in the third quarter ended September 26, 2024, we experienced continued delay in delivering the expected number of units to Boeing. Additionally, we experienced higher costs than anticipated to execute the processes identified above and anticipates that some level of higher costs will continue in the future. 
 
 On October 18, 2024, we announced a 21-day furlough, effective October 27, 2024, for approximately 700 employees working on the B767 and B777 programs in response to the strike by Boeing employees as we have reached maximum storage capacity on the B767 and B777 programs. Our ability to align our costs, including both internal and supply chain related spending, to react to unexpected changes in customer-determined production rates has and will likely continue to have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows. Our liquidity has been impacted by higher levels of inventory and contract assets, lower operational cash flows due to a decrease in expected deliveries to Boeing, higher factory costs to maintain rate readiness (attributed to product quality verification process enhancements, including moving such processes from Renton, 
 53 

Table of Contents 

 Washington, to Wichita, Kansas), Boeing no longer allowing for traveled work on the B737 fuselage to its factories, the strike by Boeing employees, and the limitations on Boeing increasing production rates. Based upon expected production volumes and deliveries, the terms of this advance require installments be repaid through October 2024, which have been deferred. 
 
 Additionally, we were in negotiations with Airbus related to pricing adjustments on the A220 and A350 programs during 2023 and continuing into 2024 with a goal of completing those negotiations in early 2024. As a result of the announcement on March 1, 2024, that we were engaged in discussions with Boeing about a possible acquisition of the Company by Boeing, there was a shift in the strategic discussions with Airbus relevant to pricing adjustments on the A220 and A350 programs, most recently with a focus toward customer advances and other accommodations. 
 
 These developments in 2024 resulted in a significant reduction in projected revenue and operating cash flows over the next twelve months. Additionally, although the advances received in 2024 have provided essential operational liquidity, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional advances from our customers, repay current advances on the specified due dates, renegotiate the due date or otherwise obtain additional liquidity as needed under acceptable terms or at all. We will need to obtain additional funding to sustain operations, as we expect to continue generating operating losses for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern exists. 
 
 As of November 5, 2024, management has developed a plan designed to improve liquidity in response to the developments highlighted above. These plans are dependent upon many factors, including, among other things, the outcomes of active discussions related to the timing or amounts of repayment for certain customer advances, the timing and expected proceeds received from certain divestitures and the expected timing and outcome of the Merger Agreement and Term Sheet announced June 30, 2024, achieving anticipated B737 deliveries, and the timing, resolution, and ultimate impact of the strike by Boeing employees. Management is also evaluating additional strategies intended to improve liquidity to support operations, including, but not limited to, additional customer advances, issuing securities or debt financing subject to any contractual limitations and conditions, including in the Merger Agreement, and restructuring of operations in an effort to increase efficiency and decrease expenses, which may include layoffs or additional furloughs. However, there can be no assurance that these plans or strategies will sufficiently improve our liquidity needs or that we will otherwise realize the anticipated benefits. For additional information, please see Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors, We have incurred significant operating losses in the last few years and have identified conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of the uncertainties described above. 
 
 Merger Agreement 
 
 On June 30, 2024, we entered into the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement contains customary covenants by us regarding the conduct of our business prior to the closing of the Merger. In addition, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to take, authorize, agree or commit to do certain actions outside of the ordinary course of business, including incurring indebtedness (other than under existing credit facilities or to replace certain existing indebtedness maturing in 2025) or materially amending the terms of existing indebtedness, issuing equity, and disposing of significant assets. We do not believe that the restrictions in the Merger Agreement will prevent us from meeting our debt obligations, ongoing costs of operations, working capital needs or capital expenditure requirements. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement in specified circumstances, we would be required to pay to Boeing a termination fee of 150.0 million. 
 
 Customer Advances 
 
 As described in the Form 8-K filed by us on April 23, 2024, on April 18, 2024, we entered into the MOA with Boeing to provide 425.0 million of cash advances, based upon our maintaining a production rate that supports Boeing s production demand in accordance with certain long-term supply agreements, all of which was received in the second quarter of 2024. Additionally, this MOA was amended on June 20, 2024 to provide an additional 40.0 million of cash advance which was received in the second quarter. 
 
 The amended MOA requires a repayment of a total of 129.5 million in July 2024, 150.6 million on August 14, 2024, 134.3 million on September 18, 2024, and 50.6 million on October 16, 2024. Our repayment obligation will be accelerated, and any outstanding amount advanced under the agreement will immediately become due and payable, in the event that (i) we fail to make any repayment in full on the applicable Repayment Date, (ii) we fail to submit a satisfactory written confirmation that we are able to and intend to make the required repayment thirty days prior to each Repayment Date, as required under the agreement, (iii) we repudiate any performance obligation under the agreement or certain of the our existing agreements with Boeing, (iv) there occurs, either as to Spirit, Spirit Holdings or any of their respective subsidiaries, any of the events of default

Table of Contents 

 (generally relating to insolvency, reorganization, liquidation or similar proceedings, or to business suspension, dissolution or winding-up) described in specified provisions of our existing agreements with Boeing, then all amounts of the advances from the MOA that remain outstanding to Boeing pursuant to the repayment provisions of the MOA as of such time will become immediately due and payable. These advances have been accounted for as financing cash flows. As of the date of this filing, we have repaid 40.0 million of the MOA advances; however, the other amounts remain outstanding. We are in discussion with Boeing regarding a second amendment to the MOA, but there can be no assurance that such amendment will be entered into on acceptable terms, if at all. 
 
 During the three months ended September 26, 2024, we received an advance payment from Airbus of 27.4 under a Memorandum of Agreement between Airbus S.A.S. and Spirit Europe, Shorts Brothers PLC and Spirit AeroSystems North Carolina, Inc Spirit North Carolina ), for up to 50.0 million related to certain program related expenditures. The remaining 22.6 million was received on October 2, 2024. This memorandum of agreement was amended on October 6, 2024 to include an additional 12.0 million for specified expenditures. This amount was received on October 8, 2024. Per the terms of the amended memorandum of agreement, these amounts will be forgiven upon close of the Airbus Transactions, or if earlier, repaid to Airbus on December 31, 2025. 
 
 During the quarter ended March 28, 2024, we received an advance payment from Airbus of 17.0 million under a term sheet agreement between Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Airbus Canada and Shorts Brothers PLC (our facilities located in Belfast, Northern Ireland), for short term funding for increased freight costs incurred in the period from January to March 2024. The full amount of the advance is to be repaid per the terms of the Airbus Term Sheet. 
 
 During the quarter ended June 29, 2023, we received cash advances of 180.0 million from Boeing related to a memorandum of agreement with Boeing executed on April 28, 2023. Per the terms of the amended memorandum of agreement, 90.0 million is payable in December 2025 and the remaining 90.0 million is payable in equal 45.0 million installments in December 2026 and 2027. Our repayment obligation will be accelerated, and any outstanding amount advanced under the agreement will immediately become due and payable, in the event that (i) we fail to make any repayment in full on the applicable Repayment Date, (ii) we fail to submit a satisfactory written confirmation that we are able to and intend to make the required repayment thirty days prior to each Repayment Date, as required under the agreement, or (iii) we repudiate any performance obligation under the agreement or certain of our existing agreements with Boeing. Boeing will have the right to set off any unpaid amount due and payable under the memorandum of agreement from any amount owed to Boeing under any other agreement between the parties. As of September 26, 2024, th e 180.0 million is reflected in the Customer financing, long-term line item on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Based on the specific terms and conditions within the final agreement, the 180.0 million receipt was shown as a financing cash flow during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, while the future repayment of the Boeing advances will be reflected as usage of financing cash flow. See Note 21 Customer Financing to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I of this Quarterly Report for more information. 
 
 During the quarters ended June 29, 2023 and September 28, 2023, we received two equal advance payments from Airbus of 50.0 million each under an agreement between Airbus S.A.S. and Spirit AeroSystems (Europe) Limited Spirit Europe signed on June 23, 2023 (the A350 Agreement ). The A350 Agreement provided for up to 100.0 million of advances that are required to be repaid along with a nominal fee to Airbus by way of offset against the purchase price of A350 FLE shipset deliveries in 2025. To the extent actual deliveries in 2025 are insufficient to offset the advance amount, any amount not offset against deliveries will be due and payable to Airbus per the terms of the Airbus Term Sheet. Related to the A350 Agreement, Spirit Europe has pledged certain program assets including work in process inventories and raw materials at Spirit s Scotland facility in an amount sufficient to cover the advances. Based on the specific terms and conditions within the A350 Agreement, the 100.0 million of receipts was included within operating cash flows during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. As the Airbus advance will be repaid through offset against shipset deliveries, those repayments will effectively reduce operating cash flow in 2025. See Note 11 Customer Advances to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I of this Quarterly Report for more information. 
 
 Advances on the B787 Program. Boeing has made advance payments to Spirit under the B787 Supply Agreement that are required to be repaid to Boeing by way of offset against the purchase price for future shipset deliveries. As of September 26, 2024, the amount of advance payments received by us from Boeing under the B787 Supply Agreement and not yet repaid was approximately 172.8 million. 
 
 Operational Impacts of Alaska Airlines Incident 
 
 The B737 MAX 9 derivative fleet was temporarily grounded by the FAA while certain safety inspections were completed and to allow the FAA time to review any required maintenance actions following the January 5, 2024 in-flight incident on a B737 MAX 9 aircraft flown by Alaska Airlines. The B737 MAX 9 fleet returned to service on January 26, 2024 after mandatory inspections were completed. We are participating in investigations relating to this incident. As discussed in Item 1A. 
 55 

Table of Contents 

 Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K, we are currently unable to fully estimate what impact this incident, including any impacts of investigations, will have on our near or long-term financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 However, certain changes made to the production and delivery process implemented by Boeing have had an immediate impact to our results of operations and cash flows. On March 2, 2024, Boeing announced they would no longer accept deliveries of product that required out of sequence assembly or incremental quality re-work. A new product verification process has been implemented by Boeing at our factory in Wichita, KS. As a result, we have experienced higher levels of inventory and contract assets and lower operational cash flows due to the inability to physically ship and invoice end items to Boeing. Additionally, during late 2023 we began preparing our production line to accommodate an expected increase in production rates that has now been delayed due to the limitation on Boeing increasing its production rates. Our ability to align our factory costs, which include both internal and supply chain related spending to react to unexpected changes in customer-determined production rates, is expected to have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows throughout 2024. 
 
 Sales of Trade Accounts Receivable 
 
 We have agreements to sell, on a revolving basis, certain trade accounts receivable balances with Boeing, Airbus, and Rolls-Royce to third-party financial institutions. These programs were primarily entered into as a result of Boeing and Airbus seeking payment term extensions with us, and they continue to allow us to monetize the receivables prior to their payment date, subject to payment of a discount. Our ability to continue using such agreements is primarily dependent upon the strength of Boeing s, Airbus s, and Rolls-Royce s financial condition. If any of these financial institutions involved with these arrangements experiences financial difficulties, becomes unwilling to support Boeing, Airbus, or Rolls-Royce due to a deterioration in their financial condition or otherwise, or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the factoring arrangements, we may experience significant disruption and potential liquidity issues, which could have an adverse impact upon our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. For the nine months ended September 26, 2024, 2,569.4 million of accounts receivable were sold via these arrangements. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 The following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the nine months ended September 26, 2024 and September 28, 2023: 
 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 26, 2024 September 28, 2023 in millions) Net cash used in operating activities (1,257.5) (339.5) Net cash used in investing activities (106.7) (76.5) Net cash provided by financing activities 764.8 134.1 Effect of exchange rate change on cash and cash equivalents 0.3 Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash for the period (599.1) (281.9) Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash beginning of period 845.9 678.4 Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, end of period 246.8 396.5 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 26, 2024 as Compared to Nine Months Ended September 28, 2023 
 
 Operating Activities. For the nine months ended September 26, 2024, we had a net cash outflow of 1,257.5 million from operating activities, an increase in net cash outflow of 918.0 million compared to a net cash outflow of 339.5 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in net cash outflow, perio d over period, primarily represents the buildup of contract assets and inventory due to the significant reduction in shipments of Boeing end items due to changes implemented by Boeing in March 2024 to introduce a new product verification process in Wichita, KS. This change in business process has delayed delivery acceptances and caused a buildup of undelivered units in Wichita, KS. Additionally, the prior year first quarter was impacted by the excess pension plan asset reversion as discussed in Note 15 Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I of this Quarterly Report. 
 
 Investing Activities. For the nine months ended September 26, 2024, we had a net cash outflow of 106.7 million for investing activities, an increase in net cash outflow of 30.2 million compared to a net cash outflow of 76.5 million for the same period in the prior year. The cash outflows for investing activities in both periods was driven by capital expenditures.

 Financing Activities. For the nine months ended September 26, 2024, we had a net cash inflow of 764.8 million for financing activities, an increase in net cash inflow of 630.7 million, compared to a net cash inflow of 134.1 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in net cash inflow was primarily driven b y 245.0 million of increased receipts of Boeing advances and 350.0 million of borrowings under the Bridge Credit Agreement in the current year. D uring the nine month periods ended September 26, 2024 and September 28, 2023, we did not pay any dividends. There were no repurchases of Holdings Common Stock under our share repurchase program during either the nine months ended September 26, 2024 or September 28, 2023. 
 
 Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Obligations 
 
 Effective October 1, 2021, we spun off a portion of the existing Pension Value Plan PVP A ), to a new plan called PVP B PVP B ). As part of the PVP B plan termination process, a lump sum offering was provided during 2021 for PVP B participants and the final asset distribution was completed in the first quarter of 2022. At September 26, 2024 and December 31, 2023, an excess pension plan asset reversion of 48.2 million and 61.1 million, respectively, is recorded on the Restricted plan assets line item on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Restricted plan assets are expected to be reduced over five years as they are distributed to employees under a qualified benefit program. 
 
 Separately, during the nine months ended September 28, 2023, we received an excess plan asset reversion of 179.5 million of cash from PVP A. This transaction was accounted for as a negative contribution and is included on the Pension plans employer contributions line item on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 28, 2023. Excise tax of 35.9 million related to the reversion of excess plan assets was separately recorded to the Other income (expense), net line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the nine months ended September 28, 2023. See also Note 20 Other Income (Expense), Net to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I of this Quarterly Report for more information. 
 
 As disclosed in the Company s 2022 Form 10-K, in July 2022, the Company adopted and communicated to participants a plan to terminate PVP A. In the first quarter of 2023, the Company recognized additional non-cash, pre-tax non-operating settlement accounting charges of 64.6 million related to the purchase of annuities for any participants not electing a lump-sum distribution. 
 
 Our U.S. pension plan remained fully funded at September 26, 2024. Our plan investments are broadly diversified, and we do not anticipate a near-term requirement to make cash contributions to our U.S. pension plan. See Note 15 Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I of this Quarterly Report for more information on the Company s pension plans. Other than the reversion of excess plan assets noted above, which was accounted for as a negative contribution, the Company s expected contributions for the current year have not significantly changed from those described in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K. The Shorts Pension has been in a deficit position during recent years, and there is a risk that additional contributions will be required from the trustees or the U.K. Pension Regulator as described under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Derivatives Accounted for as Hedges 
 
 Cash Flow Hedges Foreign Currency Forward Contract 
 
 The Company has entered into a series of currency forward contracts, each designated as a cash flow hedge upon the date of execution, for the purpose of reducing the variability of cash flows and hedging against the foreign currency exposure for forecasted payroll, pension and vendor disbursements that are expected to be made in the British pound sterling at our operations located in Belfast, Northern Ireland. All outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were settled in August 2024. Since the forecasted transactions remain probable of occurring, the changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges recorded in AOCI will be recognized in earnings in the period in which the forecasted transactions impact earnings. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI and recorded in earnings in the period in which the forecasted transactions impact earnings. The gain recognized in AOCI was 1.5 million for the nine months ended September 26, 2024. Within the next 12 months, the Company expects to recognize a gain of 1.6 million in earnings related to the foreign currency forward contracts.

 Information Regarding Guarantors of Spirit s Notes Registered Under the Securities Act of 1933 
 
 Spirit s 2026 Notes are guaranteed by Spirit AeroSystems North Carolina, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings Spirit NC ), and Holdings, and Spirit s 2028 Notes are guaranteed by Holdings. None of Spirit s notes are guaranteed by Spirit s or Holdings other domestic subsidiaries or any foreign subsidiaries (together, the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries ). The Company consolidates each of Spirit and Spirit NC in its consolidated financial statements. Spirit and Spirit NC are both 100 percent-owned and controlled by Holdings. Holdings guarantees of Spirit s indebtedness are full and unconditional, except that the guarantees may be automatically released and relieved upon satisfaction of the requirements for legal defeasance or covenant defeasance under the applicable indenture being met. Holdings guarantees are also subject to a standard limitation which provides that the maximum amount guaranteed by Holdings will not exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed without making the guarantee void under fraudulent conveyance laws. 
 
 The guarantees of Holdings and Spirit NC with respect to Spirit s 2026 Notes are made on a joint and several basis. The guarantee of Spirit NC is not full and unconditional because Spirit NC can be automatically released and relieved of its obligations under certain circumstances, including if it no longer guarantees Spirit s credit facility. Like Holdings guarantees, the guarantee of Spirit NC is subject to a standard limitation which provides that the maximum amount guaranteed by Spirit NC will not exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed without making the guarantee void under fraudulent conveyance laws. 
 
 All of the existing guarantees by Holdings and Spirit NC rank equally in right of payment with all of the guarantors existing and future senior indebtedness. The secured indebtedness of Spirit (including guarantees of Spirit s existing and future secured indebtedness) will be effectively senior to guarantees of any unsecured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. Future guarantees of subordinated indebtedness will rank junior to any existing and future senior indebtedness of the guarantors. The guarantees are structurally junior to any debt or obligations of non-guarantor subsidiaries, including all debt or obligations of subsidiaries that are released from their guarantees of the notes. As of September 26, 2024, indebtedness of our non-guarantor subsidiaries included 343.0 million of outstanding borrowings under intercompany agreements with guarantor subsidiaries and 16.5 million of finance leases of our non-guarantor subsidiaries. Based on our understanding of Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X Rule 3-10 ), we believe that Holdings guarantees of Spirit s indebtedness comply with the conditions set forth in Rule 3-10, which enable us to present summarized financial information for Holdings, Spirit and Spirit NC, which is a consolidated guarantor subsidiary, in accordance with Rule 13-01 of Regulation S-X. The summarized financial information excludes information regarding the non-guarantor subsidiaries. In accordance with Rule 3-10, separate financial statements of the guarantor subsidiaries have not been presented. The following tables include summarized financial information of Spirit, Holdings, and Spirit NC (together, the obligor group ). Investments in and equity in the earnings of the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, which are not a member of the obligor group, have been excluded. The summarized financial information of the obligor group is presented on a combined basis for Spirit and Holdings, and separately

 Supply Chain Financing Applicable to Suppliers 
 
 We have provided our suppliers with access to a supply chain financing program through facilities with third-party financing institutions. The program allows suppliers to monetize the receivables prior to their payment date, subject to payment of a discount. Our suppliers ability to continue using such agreements is primarily dependent upon the strength of our financial condition. During the nine months ended September 26, 2024 , our financing institutions adjusted their capacities resulting in a net increase in capacity under our existing supply chain financing program . While our suppliers access to this supply chain financing program could be curtailed if our credit ratings are downgraded, we do not expect that changes in the availability of supply chain financing to our suppliers will have a significant impact on our liquidity. 
 
 The balance of confirmed obligations to suppliers who elected to participate in the supply chain financing program included in our accounts payable balance as of September 26, 2024 and September 28, 2023 was 116.9 mill ion and 112.7 million, respectively. Confirmed obligations to suppliers who elected to participate in the supply chain financing program decreased by 38.7 million and increased by 10.7 million during the nine-month periods ended September 26, 2024 and September 28, 2023, respectively. While changes in each perio d typically reflect trends in purchasing levels from suppliers related to production levels during the applicable period, the decrease in the current period as compared to the balance at December 31, 2023 is primarily due to the ongoing realignment in participating suppliers and facility capacity.

 Risks Related to Our Debt, Liquidity, Financial Estimates and Taxes 
 
 We have incurred significant operating losses in the last few years and have identified conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 As described more fully in Note 1 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, since 2020, the Company has incurred significant operating losses. In particular, the Company has incurred net losses of million, 616.2 million, 545.7 million, and 540.8 million, for the nine months ended September 26, 2024, and the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. 
 
 The Company s liquidity has been impacted by, among other things, higher levels of inventory and contract assets, lower operational cash flows due to a decrease in expected deliveries to Boeing, higher factory costs to maintain rate readiness, Boeing no longer allowing for traveled work on the B737 fuselage to its factories, the strike by Boeing employees, and the limitations on Boeing increasing production rates. On October 18, 2024, the Company announced a 21-day furlough, effective October 28, 2024, for approximately 700 Company employees working on the B767 and B777 programs in response to the strike by Boeing employees, as the Company has reached maximum storage capacity on the B767 and B777 programs. 
 
 As of November 5, 2024, management has developed a plan designed to improve liquidity in response to the developments described above. These plans are dependent on many factors, including, among other things, the outcomes of our active discussions related to the timing or amounts of repayment for certain customer advances, achieving forecasted B737 deliveries, and the strike by Boeing employees. Management also is evaluating additional strategies intended to improve liquidity to support operations, including, but not limited to, additional customer advances, issuing securities or debt financing subject to any contractual limitations and conditions, including in the Merger Agreement, and restructuring of operations with the aim of increasing efficiency and decreasing expenses, which may include layoffs or additional furloughs. 
 
 There can be no assurance with respect to the outcomes of such discussions or that these plans or strategies will sufficiently improve the Company s liquidity needs to enable continuation of operations for at least the next twelve months. Accordingly, these conditions and events raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 The substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern may adversely impact the price of our common stock, our reputation and relationship with investors, employees and third parties with whom we do business, our ability to raise additional capital or refinance existing debt, our ability to comply with certain covenants under our debt agreements or meet other contractual obligations, and our ability to achieve our business objectives, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, to the extent the Company seeks additional sources of financing, there can be no assurance that such financing would be available to the Company on acceptable terms or at all, and any financing that the Company obtains could entail dilution to stockholders, onerous interest rates or covenants, or other terms that are unfavorable to the Company and the holders of its common stock.

 Risks Related to Employment Matters 
 
 Increases in labor costs, potential labor disputes, and work stoppages at our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers or 
 customers have impacted, and could materially adversely affect, our financial performance. 
 
 Our financial performance is affected by the availability of qualified personnel and the cost of labor. A majority of our workforce is represented by unions. If we were unable to renew major labor agreements at expiration, or if our workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations, which could cause us to be unable to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis and could result in a breach of our supply agreements. This could result in a loss of business and an increase in our operating expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, on June 21, 2023, employees represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers IAM voted to reject the Company s contract offer and strike. In response, the Company suspended its Wichita operations and IAM represented employees began to strike following the expiration of the contract on June 24, 2023. Although a new contract was ratified by IAM-represented employees on June 29, 2023, our labor costs will be higher than the previous IAM contract by approximately 80.0 million annually and we incurred strike disruption charges, changes in estimates during the period related to higher wages and other employee benefits resulting from the new contract and a reduction in deliveries of certain aircraft, including the B737, which will negatively impact expected revenue, earnings and cash flow. Any future strike or similar disruption could have similar adverse impacts. In addition, our non-unionized labor force may become subject to labor union organizing efforts, which could cause us to incur additional labor costs and increase the related risks that we now face. 
 
 Due to the receipt of occasional government incentives, we have certain commitments to keep our programs in their current locations. This may prevent us from being able to offer our products at prices that are competitive in the marketplace and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate new business. 
 
 In addition, many aircraft manufacturers, airlines, and aerospace suppliers, including certain of our customers, have unionized work forces. Any strikes, work stoppages, or slowdowns experienced by aircraft manufacturers, airlines, or aerospace suppliers has and could in the future reduce our customers demand for additional aircraft structures or prevent us from completing production of our aircraft structures. Union negotiations, strikes, work stoppages, or slowdowns at our customers has and could in the future also directly or indirectly impact our business. For example, on September 12, 2024, machinists at Boeing represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers voted to strike after rejecting a contract offer from Boeing. The machinists commenced a strike on September 13, 2024, that was resolved on November 4, 2024, when the machinists voted to approve a new contract. On October 18, 2024, we announced a 21-day furlough, effective October 27, 2024, for approximately 700 employees working on the B767 and B777 programs in response to the strike by Boeing employees, as the Company had reached maximum storage capacity on the B767 and B777 programs. Even as the strike has ended, we may need to implement further cost saving measures, including layoffs or additional furloughs. 
 
 Risks Related to the Merger and the Airbus Business Disposition 
 
 We may not be able to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with Airbus with respect to the Airbus Business Disposition or to complete the disposition of the Spirit Airbus Business. 
 
 Disposition by us of the Spirit Airbus Business is a condition to Boeing s obligation to consummate the Merger. Under the Airbus Term Sheet, Spirit and Airbus have agreed to negotiate in good faith definitive agreements (the Definitive Agreements ), including a purchase agreement, providing for the acquisition by Airbus or its affiliates of the Spirit Airbus Business on the terms set forth in the Airbus Term Sheet with the goal of permitting Boeing and Holdings to consummate the Merger prior to prior to a specified Outside Date (initially, March 31, 2025, subject to extension by three months on up to three occasions under certain circumstances). Execution of the Definitive Agreements is subject to and conditioned upon the completion to the satisfaction of Airbus of its due diligence. If we are able to negotiate and enter into the Definitive Agreements, there can be no assurance that we would satisfy the closing conditions in the Definitive Agreements, including receipt of regulatory approvals, or be able to consummate the disposition of the Spirit Airbus Business as contemplated by the Airbus Term Sheet or the Definitive Agreements. If we face difficulty in completing the disposition of the Spirit Airbus Business, we could be unable to satisfy the conditions to the closing under the Merger Agreement in a timely matter or at all.

 Because the market prices of Boeing Common Stock and Holdings Common Stock will fluctuate prior to the consummation of the Merger, Holdings stockholders cannot be sure of the market value of shares of Boeing Common Stock that they will receive in the Merger or the difference between the market value of shares of Boeing Common Stock that they will receive in the Merger and the market value of shares of Holdings Common Stock immediately prior to the Merger. 
 
 At the Effective Time, each share of Holdings Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Holdings Common Stock owned by Holdings, Boeing or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries, in each case not held on behalf of third parties) will be automatically cancelled and cease to exist and will be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of Boeing Common Stock equal to (a) if the Boeing Stock Price, is greater than 149.00 but less than 206.94, the quotient obtained by dividing 37.25 by the Boeing Stock Price, rounded to four decimal places, or (b) if the Boeing Stock Price is greater than or equal to 206.94, 0.1800 or (c) if the Boeing Stock Price is equal to or less than 149.00, 0.2500. The respective market prices of both Boeing Common Stock and Holdings Common Stock have fluctuated since the date on which the Merger Agreement was signed and will continue to fluctuate. The market price of Boeing Common Stock, when received by Holdings stockholders after the Merger is completed, could be greater than, less than or the same as the market price of Boeing Common Stock at the time of the special meeting of Holdings stockholders at which Holdings stockholders will vote on a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. For that reason, the market price of Boeing Common Stock on the date of the special meeting may not be indicative of the value of the shares of Boeing Common Stock that Holdings stockholders will receive upon completion of the Merger, and, at the time of the special meeting, Holdings stockholders will not know, or be able to determine, the number of shares of Boeing Common Stock that they will receive in the Merger or the market value of shares of Boeing Common Stock that they will receive in the Merger as compared to the market value of Holdings Common Stock immediately prior to the Merger. 
 
 The market prices of Boeing Common Stock and Holdings Common Stock are subject to fluctuations due both to factors affecting market prices for publicly traded equity securities generally and to factors affecting Boeing Common Stock or Holdings Common Stock in particular. Market prices of Boeing Common Stock and Holdings Common Stock have been volatile at times in the past and may be volatile in the future. Neither Boeing nor Holdings is permitted to terminate the Merger Agreement or re-solicit the vote of Holdings stockholders solely because of changes in the market price of Boeing Common Stock or Holdings Common Stock. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including general and industry-specific market and economic conditions and changes in factors specific to each of Holdings and Boeing s business, operations and prospects; regulatory and legal developments; market assessments of the benefits of the Merger and the likelihood that the Merger will be completed; timing of the Merger and receipt of related regulatory approvals; and other factors beyond our control. 
 
 The Merger is subject to conditions, including certain conditions that are beyond our control and may not be satisfied on a timely basis or at all. Failure to complete the Merger could have material adverse effects on us. 
 
 Completion of the Merger is subject to a number of conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. Some of the conditions, such as adoption of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Holdings Common Stock entitled to vote thereon and receipt of certain regulatory approvals, are beyond our control, resulting in uncertainty as to the timing of completion of the Merger and as to whether the Merger will be completed at all. The governmental authorities from which the regulatory approvals are required may impose conditions on the completion of the Merger, require changes to the terms of the Merger Agreement, prevent the consummation of the Merger or make the consummation of the Merger illegal. In addition, the Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both Holdings and Boeing that, if exercised, would result in the Merger not being consummated. 
 
 There can be no assurance that the various conditions to completion of the Merger will be satisfied or will not result in the abandonment or delay of the Merger. Any delay in completing the Merger could cause Boeing and Holdings not to realize, or to be delayed in realizing, some or all of the benefits that Boeing and Holdings expect to achieve if the Merger is completed within the time currently expected. 
 
 If the Merger is not completed, the market price of Holdings Common Stock could decline as a result, and our business could be adversely affected, including as a result of the need to pay expenses relating to the uncompleted Merger, such as legal, accounting, printing and financial advisory fees; negative reactions from our employees, customers, suppliers and financing sources, from other persons with whom we have important business relationships and from regulators and credit rating agencies; any requirement that we pay a termination fee under the Merger Agreement; and litigation related to any failure to complete the Merger or related to any enforcement proceeding that may be commenced against us to perform our obligations pursuant to the Merger Agreement. If the Merger Agreement is terminated and the Board seeks another business combination, we might not be able to find a party willing to enter into a transaction with terms equivalent to or more attractive than the terms agreed to in the Merger Agreement.

Table of Contents 

The Merger is subject to certain regulatory approvals that, if delayed, not granted or granted with burdensome or unacceptable conditions, could delay, impair or prevent consummation of the Merger or result in additional costs or reduce the anticipated benefits of the Merger. 
 
 The completion of the Merger is subject to the expiration or termination of all waiting periods (and any agreed upon extensions of any waiting period or commitment not to consummate the Merger for any period of time) applicable to the completion of the Merger under the HSR Act and the receipt of certain additional regulatory approvals, including clearance or approval by foreign investment authorities in France, the United Kingdom and Canada. 
 
 Regulatory authorities in the United States or other jurisdictions could take action under antitrust or foreign investment laws seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under antitrust laws under certain circumstances. 
 
 Any such injunctions, divestitures, requirements or legal actions could jeopardize or delay the completion, or reduce the anticipated benefits, of the Merger. There is no assurance that we and Boeing will obtain all required regulatory consents or approvals on a timely basis, or at all. Failure to obtain the necessary consents and approvals could substantially delay or prevent the completion of the Merger, which could negatively affect us. 
 
 The Merger Agreement limits our ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger and could discourage a potential competing acquiror or other strategic transaction partner from making a favorable alternative transaction proposal. 
 
 Under the Merger Agreement, we are required, subject to certain exceptions with respect to unsolicited proposals and the Divestiture Assets, not to directly or indirectly solicit competing acquisition proposals or to enter into discussions concerning, or provide confidential information in connection with, any unsolicited alternative acquisition proposals. In addition, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, we may be required to pay Boeing a termination fee of 150 million. These provisions could discourage a potential acquirer or other strategic transaction partner that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant portion of the Company from considering or pursuing an alternative transaction with us or proposing such a transaction, even if the potential acquirer or other strategic transaction partner were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than the per share market value proposed to be received or realized in the Merger. These provisions might also result in a potential acquirer or other strategic transaction partner proposing to pay a lower price than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable by us in certain circumstances. If the Merger Agreement is terminated and we seek another business combination, we may not be able to negotiate or consummate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the Merger Agreement. 
 
 The Merger, and uncertainty regarding the Merger, may adversely affect our relationships with customers, suppliers, strategic partners and others and could adversely affect our ability to manage our business. 
 
 The Merger will occur only if the Merger Agreement s conditions to consummation of the Merger are satisfied or waived. Accordingly, there may be uncertainty regarding the completion of the Merger. This uncertainty and the prospect of the Merger itself have caused and may continue to cause customers, suppliers, strategic partners and others that deal with us to delay or defer entering into contracts with us or making other decisions concerning the Company or to seek changes in or cancellation of existing business relationships with us. Delays or deferrals of contracts or other decisions or changes in or cancellations of existing agreements or relationships could in some individual cases or in the aggregate have an adverse impact on our business, regardless of whether the Merger is ultimately completed. 
 
 In addition, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the Merger, including being obligated to use reasonable best efforts to conduct our business in all material respects in the ordinary course and not to engage in specified types of actions, subject to certain exceptions. These restrictions could delay or otherwise adversely affect our ability to execute certain of our business strategies or limit our ability to respond to competitive or other developments that arise prior to the completion of the Merger and could negatively affect our business and operations.

 Uncertainties associated with the Merger and the Airbus Business Disposition may result in our losing management and other key personnel, which could adversely affect our business and operations. 
 
 We are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key management, technical and professional personnel to execute our business plans. Our success, including as a part of Boeing after the Merger, will depend in part upon our ability to retain key management and other key personnel. Current and prospective employees of ours may experience uncertainty about their roles with us or the Spirit Airbus Business following the Merger and the Airbus Business Disposition or have other concerns regarding the timing and completion of the Merger and the Airbus Business Disposition or regarding the operations of the Company and the Spirit Airbus Business following the Merger and the Airbus Business Disposition, any of which may have an adverse effect on our ability to retain, attract or motivate key management and other key personnel. If we are unable to retain personnel, including key management, who are critical to future operations, we could face disruptions in our operations, loss of customers, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated additional recruitment and training costs. In addition, the loss of key personnel could diminish the anticipated benefits of the Merger or delay the completion of the Merger. 
 
 We have incurred and expect to incur significant transaction costs in connection with the Merger and the Airbus Business Disposition. 
 
 We have incurred and expected to continue to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with negotiating and completing the Merger and the Airbus Business Disposition, including, among others, fees paid to financial, legal, accounting and other advisors, employee retention, severance and benefit costs, filing fees and, potentially, termination fees. These fees and costs have been, and will continue to be, substantial and, in many cases, will be borne by us whether or not the Merger and the Airbus Business Disposition are completed, and could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 Completion of the Merger may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain of our agreements. 
 
 The completion of the Merger may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain of our agreements. If we are unable to negotiate modifications, consents or waivers of those provisions, following completion of the Merger, the counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under such agreements, potentially terminate such agreements or seek monetary damages. Even if we are able to negotiate modifications, consents or waivers, the counterparties may require a fee for such modifications, consents or waivers or seek to renegotiate such agreements on terms less favorable to us. Any of the foregoing or similar developments could have an adverse effect on our or Boeing s business and results of operations following completion of the Merger. 
 
 Securities class action and derivative lawsuits in connection with the Merger or the Airbus Business Disposition could result in substantial costs and prevent or delay the consummation of the Merger. 
 
 Securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against public companies that have entered into acquisition or merger agreements. Defending against and settling or otherwise resolving these types of claims can result in substantial costs, including costs associated with indemnification of directors and officers, and divert management time and resources. An adverse judgment in any such litigation relating to the Merger or the Airbus Business Disposition could result in monetary damages, which could have a negative impact on Boeing s and the Company s respective liquidity and financial condition. If a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting completion of the Merger or the Airbus Business Disposition, that injunction could delay or prevent the Merger from being completed, which could adversely affect our and Boeing s businesses, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 As of November 5, 2024, one lawsuit challenging the Merger had been filed on behalf of purported Holdings stockholders. On August 29, 2024, following the public announcement of the Merger, a lawsuit relating to the Merger was filed by a purported Holdings stockholder against Holdings and the Holdings board of directors in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (the Lawsuit ). The Lawsuit, captioned Murphy v. Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. et al. , Docket No. 1:24-cv-06539, alleges, among other things, that the registration statement on Form S-4 relating to the Merger fails to disclose certain allegedly material information in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The Lawsuit seeks injunctive relief enjoining the Merger, damages, costs, and other remedies.

 After the Merger, Holdings stockholders will have a significantly lower ownership and voting interest in Boeing than they currently have in Holdings and will exercise less influence over management. 
 
 Immediately following completion of the Merger, Holdings stockholders will have a significantly lower ownership and voting interest in Boeing than they currently have in Holdings. Consequently, former Holdings stockholders will have less influence over the management and policies of Boeing than they currently have over the management and policies of Holdings. 
 
 The shares of Boeing Common Stock to be received by Holdings stockholders upon completion of the Merger will have different rights from shares of Holdings Common Stock. 
 
 Upon completion of the Merger, Holdings stockholders will no longer be stockholders of Holdings, but will instead become stockholders of Boeing, and their rights as Boeing stockholders will be governed by the terms of the Boeing certificate of incorporation and bylaws. The terms of Boeing s certificate of incorporation and bylaws are in some respects materially different from the terms of Holdings certificate of incorporation and bylaws, which currently govern the rights of Holdings stockholders. 
 
 Holdings stockholders will not be entitled to appraisal rights in the Merger. 
 
 Under Delaware law, holders of Holdings Common Stock will not have appraisal rights in connection with the Merger.
