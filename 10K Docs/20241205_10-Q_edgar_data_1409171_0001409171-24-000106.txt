 million and million as of October 31, 2024 and January 31, 2024, respectively. Our deferred revenue most often increases in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year due to a higher level of customer down payments or prepayments and longer time periods between customer payment and delivery of the equipment asset, and the related recognition of equipment revenue, prior to its seasonal use. During the nine months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized million and million, respectively, of revenue that was included in the deferred revenue balance as of January 31, 2024 and January 31, 2023, respectively.

 The Company reviews its long-lived assets for potential impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the long-lived asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. The Company determined, based on changing expectations regarding the future use of certain long-lived assets, that the 15.4 million carrying value of these assets may not be fully recoverable. The Company performed an impairment assessment of this asset group and as a result recognized an impairment charge of 0.3 million, of which 0.2 million was within the Agriculture segment and 0.1 million was within the Construction segment, for the three months ended October 31, 2024. For the nine months ended October 31, 2024, the Company recognized total impairment charges of 1.2 million, of which 0.2 million was within the Agriculture segment, 0.1 million was within the Construction segment and 0.9 million was within the Europe segment. The impairment charge is reflected in the Impairment of Intangibles and Long-Lived Assets amount in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 The Company performed an interim impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 for the German reporting unit. Under the impairment test, the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using an income approach in which a discounted cash flow analysis is utilized, which includes a five-year forecast of future operating performance for the reporting unit and a terminal value that estimates sustained long-term growth. The discount rate applied to the estimated future cash flows reflects an estimate of the weighted-average cost of capital of comparable companies. 
 In second quarter of fiscal year 2025, the quantitative goodwill impairment analysis for the German reporting unit indicated that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value. The implied fair value of the goodwill associated with the reporting unit approximated zero, thus requiring a full impairment charge of the goodwill carrying value of the reporting unit. As such, a goodwill impairment charge of million was recognized within the Europe segment, which is reflected in Impairment of Goodwill in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 The recognition of goodwill in the above business combination arose from the acquisition of an assembled workforce and anticipated synergies expected to be realized. The acquired customer relationship intangible assets are being amortized on a straight line basis over a useful life of years. The distribution rights assets are indefinite-lived intangible assets not subject to amortization, but are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events or when circumstances indicate that impairment may be present. The Company estimated the fair value of these intangible assets using a multi-period excess earnings model, an income approach.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our interim unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report, and the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024. 
 
 Overview 
 We own and operate a network of full service agricultural and construction equipment stores in the United States, Australia, and Europe. Based upon information provided to us by CNH Industrial N.V. or its U.S. subsidiary CNH Industrial America, LLC, we are the largest retail dealer of CaseIH Agriculture equipment in the world, one of the largest retail dealers of Case Construction equipment in North America and one of the largest retail dealers of New Holland Agriculture and New Holland Construction equipment in the United States. We operate our business through four reportable segments: Agriculture, Construction, Europe and Australia. Within each segment, we have four principal sources of revenue: new and used equipment sales, parts sales, service, and equipment rental and other activities. 
 Demand for agricultural equipment and, to a lesser extent, parts and service support, is impacted by agricultural commodity prices and net farm income. Based on September 2024 U.S. Department of Agriculture publications, the estimate of net farm income for calendar year 2024 indicated an approximate 4.4 decrease as compared to calendar year 2023, which follows an approximate 19.5 decrease in net farm income for calendar year 2023 as compared to calendar year 2022. Given this expected decrease in farmer profitability, the industry is experiencing decreased demand for equipment purchases. 
 For the third quarter of fiscal 2025, our net income was 1.7 million, or 0.07 per diluted share, compared to a fiscal 2024 third quarter net income of 30.2 million, or 1.32 per diluted share. Significant factors impacting the quarterly comparisons were: 
 Gross profit margin decreased to 16.3 for the third quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to 19.9 for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease in gross profit margin is primarily due to lower equipment margins, which are being driven by higher levels of inventory and softening demand. In addition, the Company has taken an active stance on managing inventory down to targeted levels. 
 Floorplan interest expense increased by 5.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2024. The increase is primarily due to a higher level of interest-bearing inventory and usage of existing floorplan capacity to finance the O'Connors acquisition in October 2023. 
 Revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 decreased by 2.1 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The revenue decrease was led by softening of demand for equipment purchases due to the expected decline of net farm income this growing season and mostly offset by the additional revenue resulting from the acquisition of O'Connors, in October 2023. 
 
 Acquisitions 
 Fiscal 2024 
 J.J. O Connor Sons Pty. Ltd. Acquisition 
 On October 2, 2023, we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of O Connors. The acquired business consisted of 15 CaseIH dealership locations and one parts center in the states of New South Wales, South Australia, and Victoria in Southeastern Australia. O'Connors has been a successful Case IH complex, and our acquisition of this entity provides us with the opportunity to expand our international presence into the large, well-established Australian agriculture market. Total cash consideration paid for O'Connors was 66.5 million, which was financed through available cash resources and line of credit availability. The 15 O Connors store locations are included within our Australia segment. 
 ERP Transition 
 In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, we completed the implementation of the phased roll-out plan to integrate all of our domestic stores to the new Enterprise Resource Planning ("ERP"). With the full domestic implementation complete, the focus has now shifted to the next phase, which is working with the ERP provider to enhance the support tools to improve employee efficiency and customer experience.

 Total revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 declined by 2.1 or 14.3 million compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2024 primarily due to same-store sales decrease of 10.5 resulting from challenging industry conditions such as decreases in agricultural commodity prices and projected net farm income which have a negative effect on customer sentiment. Further, in the September 2024 U.S. Department of Agriculture publications, calendar year 2024's net farm income is forecasted to decrease 4.4 compared to 2023, which in turn had a decline of 19.5 in net farm income compared to 2022. This was partially offset by the acquisition of O'Connors that was completed in October 2023.

 Gross profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 decreased 20.1 or 27.8 million, as compared to the same period last year. Gross profit margin declined to 16.3 in the current quarter from 19.9 in the prior year quarter. The decrease in gross profit margin in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was primarily due to lower equipment margins, which are being driven by higher levels of inventory and softening demand. 
 Our Company-wide absorption rate which is calculated by dividing our gross profit from sales of parts, service and rental fleet by our operating expenses, less commission expense on equipment sales, plus interest expense on floorplan payables and rental fleet debt decreased to 74.1 for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 87.4 during the same period last year. The decrease in our absorption rate was primarily due to increased floorplan interest expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the same period last year.

 Our operating expenses in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 7.2 as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of additional operating expenses due to acquisitions that have taken place in the past year. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 14.5 in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 from 13.3 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

 The change in interest and other income (expense) for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was primarily due to foreign currency fluctuations in the quarter. The increase in floorplan interest expense for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was primarily due to a higher level of interest-bearing inventory, including the usage of existing floorplan capacity to finance the O'Connors acquisition in October 2023. The increase in other interest expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 is the result of increased borrowing on our CNH Industrial revolving line of credit as well as an increased amount of long term debt outstanding resulting from real estate purchased as part of dealership acquisitions and purchases of previously leased facilities in fiscal 2024.

 Our effective tax rate was and for each of the three months ended October 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023, respectively. The decreased effective tax rate was primarily due to the impact of certain discrete items, mainly the vesting of share-based compensation, the mix of domestic and foreign income and the impact of the recognition of valuation allowance on our foreign deferred tax assets. 
 The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development s OECD Pillar Two Global Anti-Base Erosion GloBE model rules, issued under the OECD Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, introduce a global minimum tax of 15 applicable to multinational enterprise groups with consolidated financial statement revenue in excess of 750 million. Numerous foreign jurisdictions have already enacted tax legislation based on the GloBE rules, with some effective as early as January 1, 2024. As of October 31, 2024, we recognized a nominal income tax expense for Pillar Two GloBE minimum tax. The Company is continuously monitoring the evolving application of this legislation and assessing its potential impact on our future tax liability.

 Agriculture 
 Agriculture segment revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 decreased 9.3 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily driven by a same-store sales decrease of 10.8 . The same-store sales decrease was due to a decrease in equipment revenue, which resulted from challenging industry conditions, such as, decreases in agricultural commodity prices and projected net farm income, which negatively affected customer sentiment in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to the same period in the prior year. Changes in actual or anticipated net farm income generally have a direct correlation with the retail demand for equipment. 
 Agriculture segment income before income taxes for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was 1.9 million compared to 35.1 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease in gross profit is primarily due to lower sales, which is being driven by softening demand, lower equipment margins, as well as an increase in floorplan interest expense. 
 Construction 
 Construction segment revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 10.0 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase in revenue was primarily due to timing of equipment sales. 
 Our Construction segment loss before income taxes was 0.9 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 4.1 million income before income taxes in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease in segment results was primarily related to a lower equipment margins as well as higher floorplan interest expense compared to same period last year. In addition, dollar utilization of our rental fleet decreased from 33.2 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 to 26.2 in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. Dollar fleet utilization is calculated by dividing the rental revenue earned on our rental fleet by the average gross carrying value of our rental fleet (comprised of original equipment costs plus additional capitalized costs) for that period. 
 Europe 
 Europe segment revenue was 62.4 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 85.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease in revenue results the softening of equipment demand, which results from a decrease in global agricultural commodity prices, sustained higher interest rates and drought conditions in Eastern Europe which have negatively impacted yields and grower profitability.

Table of Contents 

Our Europe segment loss before income taxes was 1.2 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 5.1 million income before income taxes in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease in segment pre-tax income was primarily the result of decreased equipment sales as noted above as well as a reduction in equipment gross margins due to softening of demand. 
 Australia 
 We entered the Australian market in October 2023 with our acquisition of O'Connors. Australia segment revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was 50.1 million. Our Australia segment loss before income taxes was 0.3 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2025. 
 Shared Resources/Eliminations 
 We incur centralized expenses/income at our general corporate level, which we refer to as Shared Resources, and then allocate most of these net expenses to our segments. Since these allocations are set early in the year, unallocated balances may occur. Shared Resources income before income taxes was 0.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to loss before income taxes of 3.9 million for the same period last year.

 Total revenue for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 increased by 1.9 , or 35.9 million, compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2024, driven primarily by the acquisition of O'Connors that was completed in October 2023 and offset by the decrease in Company-wide same-store sales of 7.6 . The same-store sales were negatively impacted by challenging industry conditions, such as, decreases in agricultural commodity prices and projected net farm income, which have a negative effect on retail demand for equipment. Further, in the September 2024 U.S. Department of Agriculture publications, calendar year 2024's net farm income is forecasted to decrease by 4.4 compared to 2023, which in turn had a decline of 19.5 in net farm income compared to 2022.

Gross profit margin also decreased to 17.7 in the first nine months of fiscal 2025 from 20.5 in the same period last year. The decrease in gross profit margin for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 was primarily due to lower equipment margins, which are being driven by higher levels of inventory and softening demand. 
 Our Company-wide absorption rate for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 decreased to 72.8 , as compared to 95.9 during the same period last year. The decrease in absorption was primarily driven by increased floorplan interest expense in the first nine months of fiscal 2025 compared to the same period last year.

 The change in interest and other income (expense) compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was primarily due to the impact of 11.2 million of non-cash, sale-leaseback financing expense related to the agreement to purchase 13 of our leased facilities at the end of the respective lease terms and offset by the 3.6 million gain on cancellation of debt in relation to a New Market Tax Credit Program. Floorplan interest expense increased 18.5 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2025, as compared to the same period last year, primarily due to a higher level of interest-bearing inventory, including the usage of existing floorplan capacity to finance the O'Connors acquisition in October 2023. The increase in other interest expense in the first nine months of fiscal 2025 is the result of an increased amount of long term debt outstanding resulting from real estate purchased as part of dealership acquisitions and purchases of previously leased facilities in fiscal 2024 as well as increased borrowing on our CNH Industrial revolving line of credit.

 Agriculture 
 Agriculture segment revenue for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 decreased 4.9 compared to the same period last year. The revenue decrease was due to a same-store sales decrease of 6.5 during the first nine months of fiscal 2025 as compared to the prior year period. The same-store sales decrease was due to a decrease in equipment revenue resulting from challenging industry conditions, such as decreases in agricultural commodity prices and projected net farm income, which negatively affected customer sentiment in fiscal 2025, as compared to the same period in the prior year. Changes in actual or anticipated net farm income generally have a direct correlation with retail demand for equipment. 
 Agriculture segment income before income taxes was 15.6 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 compared to 92.3 million over the first nine months of fiscal 2024. The decrease in gross profit is primarily due to lower equipment margins, which are driven by higher levels of inventory and softening demand. In addition, we recorded a 6.1 million non-cash, sale-leaseback finance modification expense related to the agreement to purchase 13 of our leased facilities at the end of the respective lease terms and had an increase in our operating expenses and floorplan interest expense. 
 Construction 
 Construction segment revenue for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 increased 2.0 compared to the same period last year. 
 Our Construction segment loss before income taxes was 5.6 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 compared to 13.7 million of income before income taxes for the first nine months of fiscal 2024. The decrease in segment results was led by a 5.1 million non-cash, sale-leaseback finance modification expense related to the agreement to purchase for 13 of our leased facilities at the end of the respective lease terms, equipment gross margins were also lower due to increased supply and

moderately softer demand, and floorplan interest expense increased compared to the same period last year. The dollar utilization of our rental fleet decreased from 30.1 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 to 24.2 in the first nine months of fiscal 2025. 
 Europe 
 Europe segment revenue for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 decreased 21.8 compared to the same period last year. The decrease in revenue reflects the softening of new equipment demand, which results from by a decrease in global agricultural commodity prices, sustained higher interest rates and drought conditions in Eastern Europe which negatively impacted yields and grower profitability. 
 Our Europe segment loss before income taxes was 2.1 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 compared to 17.1 million of income before income taxes for the same period last year. The decrease in segment pre-tax income was primarily the result of decreased equipment sales as noted above. Additionally, we recorded 0.5 million of impairment expense related to certain goodwill assets and 0.9 million in impairment expense related to other intangible assets and long-lived assets. 
 Australia 
 We entered the Australian market in October 2023 with our acquisition of O'Connors. Australia segment revenue for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 was 155.9 million. Our Australia segment income before income taxes was 0.6 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2025.

 We incur centralized expenses/income at our general corporate level, which we refer to as Shared Resources, and then allocate most of these net expenses to our segments. Since these allocations are set early in the year, and a portion is planned to be unallocated, unallocated balances may occur. Shared Resources income before income taxes was 0.4 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 compared to a loss before income taxes of 5.7 million for the same period last year.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 To supplement net income and diluted earnings per share ("Diluted EPS"), both GAAP measures, we present adjusted net income and adjusted Diluted EPS, both non-GAAP financial measures that include an adjustment for the impact of a one-time, non-cash sale-leaseback financing expense. We believe that the presentation of adjusted net income and adjusted Diluted EPS is relevant and useful to our management and investors because it provides a measurement of earnings on activities that we consider to occur in the ordinary course of our business. Adjusted net income and adjusted Diluted EPS should be evaluated in addition to, and not considered a substitute for, or superior to, the most comparable GAAP measure. In addition, other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures in a different manner, which may hinder comparability of our adjusted results with those of other companies. 
 The following tables reconcile (i) net income, a GAAP measure, to adjusted net income and (ii) Diluted EPS, a GAAP measure, to adjusted Diluted EPS:

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash reserves, cash generated from operations, and borrowings under our floorplan and other credit facilities. We expect these sources of liquidity to be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements, acquisitions, capital expenditures and other investments in our business, service our debt, pay our tax and lease obligations and other commitments and contingencies, and meet any seasonal operating requirements for the foreseeable future. However, our borrowing capacity under our floorplan and other credit facilities is dependent on compliance with various covenants as further described in the "Risk Factors" section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Equipment Inventory and Floorplan and Working Capital Payable Credit Facilities 
 As of October 31, 2024, the Company had floorplan payable lines of credit for equipment purchases totaling 1.5 billion, which is primarily comprised of a 875.0 million credit facility with CNH Industrial, a 390.0 million floorplan payable line and a 110.0 million working capital line of credit under the Bank Syndicate Agreement, and a 80.0 million credit facility with DLL Finance. 
 Our equipment inventory turnover decreased from 2.4 times for the rolling 12 month period ended October 31, 2023 to 1.6 times for the rolling 12 month period ended October 31, 2024. The decrease in equipment turnover was attributable to an 
 33 

Table of Contents 

increase in equipment inventory over the rolling 12 month period ended October 31, 2024 and a decline in demand for equipment purchases. Our equity in equipment inventory, which reflects the portion of our equipment inventory balance that is not financed by floorplan payables, decreased to 13.9 as of October 31, 2024 from 18.2 as of January 31, 2024. 
 Adequacy of Capital Resources 
 Our primary uses of cash have been to fund our operating activities, including the purchase of inventories and providing for other working capital needs, meeting our debt service requirements, making payments due under our various leasing arrangements, funding capital expenditures, including rental fleet assets, and funding acquisitions. Based on our current operational performance, we believe our cash flow from operations, available cash and available borrowing capacity under our existing credit facilities will adequately provide for our liquidity needs for, at a minimum, the next 12 months. 
 As of October 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the financial covenants under our CNH Industrial and DLL Finance credit agreements and we were not subject to the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant under the Bank Syndicate Agreement as our adjusted excess availability plus eligible cash collateral (as defined therein) was not less than 15 of the lesser of (i) aggregate borrowing base and (ii) maximum credit amount as of October 31, 2024. The financial covenants also require us to maintain an adjusted debt to tangible net worth ratio of 3.5, which is measured on a quarterly basis. 
 On December 2, 2024, we received a letter from CNH Industrial Capital America LLC that waived the Consolidated Fixed Charge Cover Ratio covenant for the period February 1, 2025 through January 31, 2026. We also received a letter from DLL Finance LLC dated December 2, 2024, which waived the Minimum Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio covenant for the period April 30, 2025 through January 31, 2026. On December 3, 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Bank Syndicate Agreement that lowers the adjusted excess availability metric from 15 to 10 for the period December 15, 2024 to March 15, 2025, and thereafter reverts to 15 . 
 While not expected to occur, if operating results were to create the likelihood of a future covenant violation, we would continue to work with our lenders on an appropriate modification or amendment to our financing arrangements. 
 Cash Flow 
 Cash Flow Used for Operating Activities 
 Net cash used for operating activities was 56.2 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2025, compared to 82.1 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2024. The decrease in the usage of cash for operating activities was primarily driven by an increase in inventory and favorable collection of outstanding receivables, which was partially offset by decrease in the amount drawn on manufacturing floorplan payables and decrease in net income for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 compared to the prior year period. 
 Cash Flow Used for Investing Activities 
 Net cash used for investing activities was 29.4 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2025, compared to 64.1 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2024. The decrease in net cash used for investing activities was primarily the result of the acquisitions of Pioneer Farm Equipment and MAREP in the first nine months of fiscal 2024. 
 Cash Flow Provided by Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 71.0 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 compared to 170.3 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by a higher amount drawn on non-manufacturing floorplan payables during the first nine months of fiscal 2024. 
 Information Concerning Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of October 31, 2024, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Therefore, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships. 
 
 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2024, and in other materials filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (and included in oral statements or other written statements made by the Company). 
 Forward-looking statements are statements based on future expectations and specifically may include, among other things, the impact of farm income levels on customer demand for agricultural equipment and services, the effectiveness and

expected benefits of our new ERP system and the timing of the phased roll-out of the ERP system to the Company's domestic locations, the general market conditions of the agricultural and construction industries, equipment inventory levels and our ability to manage inventory down to target levels and the effects of these actions on future results, and our primary liquidity sources being sufficient to meet future business needs for the foreseeable future, and the adequacy of our capital resources to provide for our liquidity needs for the next 12 months. Any statements that are not based upon historical facts, including the outcome of events that have not yet occurred and our expectations for future performance, are forward-looking statements. The words potential, believe, estimate, expect, intend, may, could, will, plan, anticipate, and similar words and expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of our management. These forward-looking statements involve important risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect anticipated results or outcomes in the future and, accordingly, actual results or outcomes may differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on our Ukrainian subsidiary, our ability to successfully integrate and realize growth opportunities and synergies in connection with the O'Connors acquisition, the risk that we have assumed unforeseen or other liabilities in connection with the O'Connors acquisition, the impact of those conditions and obligations imposed on us under the CaseIH dealer agreements entered into in connection with our acquisition of the Heartland companies, commercial application equipment business, our substantial dependence on CNH Industrial, including CNH Industrial's ability to design, manufacture and allocate inventory to our stores in quantities necessary to satisfy our customer's demands, disruptions of supply chains and associated impacts on the Company's supply vendors and their ability to provide the Company with sufficient and timely inventory to meet customer demand, adverse market conditions in the agricultural and construction equipment industries, and those matters identified and discussed under the section titled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to those matters, there may exist additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial that may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and may cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Other than as required by applicable law, we disclaim any obligation to update such risks and uncertainties or to publicly announce results of revisions to any of the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to reflect future events or developments.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Exposure to changes in interest rates results from borrowing activities used to fund operations. For fixed rate debt, interest rate changes affect the fair value of financial instruments but do not impact earnings or cash flows. Conversely, for floating rate debt, interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flows, assuming other factors are held constant. We have both fixed and floating rate financing. Some of our floating rate credit facilities contain minimum rates of interest to be charged. Based upon our interest-bearing balances and interest rates as of October 31, 2024, holding other variables constant, a one percentage point change in interest rates for the next 12-month period would have a positive or negative impact to the pre-tax earnings and cash flow by approximately 5.9 million. At October 31, 2024, we had floorplan payables of 1.0 billion, of which approximately 588.0 million was variable-rate and 460.2 million was non-interest bearing. In addition, at October 31, 2024, we had total long-term debt, including finance lease obligations, of 185.3 million, primarily all of which was fixed rate debt. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 Our foreign currency exposures arise as the result of our foreign operations. We are exposed to transactional foreign currency exchange rate risk through our foreign entities holding assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. In addition, the Company is exposed to foreign currency transaction risk as a result of certain intercompany financing transactions. The Company attempts to manage its transactional foreign currency exchange rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments, primarily foreign exchange forward contracts, or through natural hedging instruments. Based upon balances and exchange rates as of October 31, 2024, holding other variables constant, we believe that a hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in all applicable foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows. As of October 31, 2024, our Ukrainian subsidiary had 0.1 million of net monetary liabilities denominated in Ukrainian hryvnia ("UAH"). We have attempted to minimize our net monetary asset position in Ukraine through reducing overall asset levels in Ukraine and at times through borrowing in UAH which serves as a natural hedging instrument offsetting our net UAH denominated assets. Many of the currency and payment controls the National Bank of Ukraine imposed in February 2022, have been relaxed, making it more practicable to manage our UAH exposure. However, the continuation of the Russia/Ukraine conflict could lead to more significant UAH devaluations or more stringent payment controls in the future. The inability to fully manage our net monetary asset position and continued UAH devaluations for an extended period of time, could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows. 
 In addition to transactional foreign currency exchange rate risk, we are also exposed to translational foreign currency exchange rate risk as we translate the results of operations and assets and liabilities of our foreign operations from their functional currency to the U.S. dollar. As a result, our results of operations, cash flows and net investment in our foreign operations may be adversely impacted by fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. We believe that a hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in all applicable foreign exchange rates, holding all other variables constant, would not have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures . After evaluating the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with the participation of the Company s management, have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) are effective. 
 (b) Changes in internal controls . In August 2024, the Company completed the implementation of its new ERP system and modified certain existing internal control processes and procedures related to the new system. These changes did not materially affect its internal control over financial reporting. As the Company implements new functionality under this ERP system, the Company will continue to assess the impact on its internal control over financial reporting.
