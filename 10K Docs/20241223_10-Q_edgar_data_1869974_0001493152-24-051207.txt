SPECIAL
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Report ), including the section entitled Management s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 under Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ),
and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and such statements are made pursuant
to the safe harbor provisions contained therein. These forward-looking statements relate to current expectations and strategies, future
operations, future financial positioning, future revenue, projected costs, prospects, current plans, current objectives of management
and expected market growth, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, levels
of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from expectations, estimates, and projections expressed or implied
by these forward-looking statements and, consequently, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as a guarantee, an assurance,
a prediction, or a definitive statement of fact or probability of future events. All statements contained in this Report, other than
statements of historical fact, including statements regarding our future operating results and financial position, our business strategy
and plans and our objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. The words may, should, 
 could, predict, potential, plan, seeks, believe, 
 will likely result, expect, continue, will continue, will, will
be, anticipate, seek, estimate, intend, plan, projection, 
 would, outlook, and similar expressions that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes, or the negative
version of those words or phrases or other comparable words or phrases of a future or forward-looking nature, are intended to identify
forward-looking statements. The absence of such words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. 

You
should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained
in this Report primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business,
financial condition and operating results. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks,
uncertainties and other factors including those below in this Report under the caption Risk Factors and in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, under the captions Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
and Risk Factors . These factors and the other risk factors described in our periodic and current reports filed with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC from time to time, however, are not necessarily all of the important
factors that could cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by
any of our forward-looking statements. 

Moreover,
we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not
possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this
Report. The results, events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur, and actual results,
events or circumstances could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. 

In
addition, statements that we believe and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These
statements are based on information available to us as of the date of this Report. And, while we believe that information provides a
reasonable basis for these statements, that information may be limited or incomplete. Our statements should not be read to indicate that
we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain, and
investors are cautioned not to unduly rely on these statements. 

The
forward-looking statements made in this Report relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We undertake no
obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Report to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Report
or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. We may not actually achieve the plans,
intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking
statements. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint
ventures or investments. 

Unless
the context otherwise requires, the terms Ocean Biomedical, Inc., the Company, we, our, 
 us, or similar references in this Report refer to Ocean Biomedical, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

BIOMEDICAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

million,
in aggregate consideration before transaction and other fees, which Legacy Ocean stockholders received in the form of shares of common
stock of the Company (the consummation of the business combination and other transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement,
collectively, the Business Combination ). 

The
Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles U.S. GAAP ). Under this method of accounting, AHAC, which is the legal acquirer, is treated as the
 acquired company for financial reporting purposes and Legacy Ocean is treated as the accounting acquirer. The net
assets of AHAC are stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. All historical financial
information presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements represents Legacy Ocean and its wholly-owned subsidiaries
as Legacy Ocean is the predecessor to the Company. The wholly-owned subsidiaries include: (i) Ocean ChitofibroRx Inc., (ii) Ocean
ChitoRx Inc., (iii) Ocean Sihoma Inc., and (iv) Ocean Promise, Inc. The Business Combination is accounted for as the equivalent of a
capital transaction in which the Company has issued stock for the net assets of AHAC. 

The
Company s common stock and warrants commenced trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the symbols OCEA and OCEAW, 
respectively, on February 15, 2023. Refer to Note 3, Business Combination and Backstop Agreement , for additional details. 

The
Company is subject to risks common to companies in the biopharmaceutical industry, including, but not limited to, risks related to the
successful development and commercialization of product candidates, fluctuations in operating results and financial risks, the ability
to successfully raise additional funds when needed, protection of proprietary rights and patent risks, patent litigation, compliance
with government regulations, dependence on key personnel and prospective collaborative partners, and competition from competing products
in the marketplace. 

Going
Concern Considerations 

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern, which
contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. 

The
Company had no cash inflows from operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had
cash of thousand, restricted cash of million, and a working capital deficiency of million. The Company s current
operating plan indicates it will incur losses from operations and generate negative cash flows from operating activities, given anticipated
expenditures related to research and development activities and its lack of revenue generating ability at this point in the Company s
lifecycle. These events and conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within
one year after the date these financial statements are issued. 

The
Company will need to raise additional funds in order to advance its research and development programs, operate its business, and meet
its current and future obligations as they come due. Based on the Company s current operational plans and assumptions, which may
not be realized, the Company expects to use the net proceeds from the Backstop Agreement (as defined in Note 3, Business Combination
and Backstop Agreement and future debt and equity financings, including possibly under the Common Stock Purchase Agreement (as defined
in Note 3, Business Combination and Backstop Agreement and the SPA entered into in May 2023 (as defined in Note 7, Senior
Secured Convertible Notes as well as further deferrals of certain of its accrued expenses and contingency payments due upon the
closing of future financings to fund operations. However, the Company s ability to utilize certain of its in-place financing arrangements,
such as the Backstop Agreement, or execute on new sources of liquidity are dependent on various factors outside of the Company s
control, including market conditions and the performance of the Company s common stock. 

There
is no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining additional financing on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all,
and the Company may not be able to enter into collaborations or other arrangements. If the Company is unable to obtain funding, the Company
could be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate its research and development programs, which could adversely affect its business prospects
and its ability to continue operations. 

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification
of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Impacts
of Market Conditions on Our Business 

Disruption
of global financial markets and a recession or market correction, including the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine
and the related sanctions imposed against Russia, the effects of Hamas attack of Israel and the ensuing war, and other global
macroeconomic factors such as inflation and rising interest rates, could reduce the Company s ability to access capital, which
could in the future negatively affect the Company s liquidity and could materially affect the Company s business and the
value of its common stock. 

million and million, respectively, consisting of the portion of proceeds received from the 2023 Convertible
Note, as defined in Note 7, Senior Secured Convertible Notes , that is being held in an escrow account. 

million as a reduction to the Business Combination proceeds into additional paid-in capital during the first quarter of 2023. The
Company recorded 
million as a component of other income (expense) in its condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended
March 31, 2023, as the amounts were in excess of the proceeds generated as a result of the Business Combination. 

liability for income tax associated with uncertain
tax positions. 

shares of the Company s common stock on the open market for 
per share (the Redemption Price ). The Company agreed to purchase the unsold portion of the Backstop Shares from the
Backstop Parties on a forward basis upon the Maturity Date (as amended, the third anniversary of the closing of the
Business Combination, subject to certain acceleration provisions). The purchase price payable by the Company includes a prepayment
in the amount of the Redemption Price per share (the Prepayment from the proceeds released from the trust account
related to those shares. Among the acceleration provisions is the Backstop Parties right to accelerate the Maturity Date if
the Company s stock price trades below a stipulated price per share for any 30 trading days during a 45 day consecutive
trading-day period (in October 2023, this acceleration provision was amended with one Backstop Party providing it the right to
accelerate the Maturity Date if the Company s stock price trades below a stipulated price per share for any 20 trading days
during a 30 day consecutive trading-day period). On any date following the closing of the Business Combination, the Backstop Parties
also have the option to early terminate the arrangement in whole or in part by providing an optional early termination date notice
to the Company (the Optional Early Termination ). For those shares that are early terminated (the Terminated
Shares ), the Backstop Parties will owe the Company an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of Terminated Shares and
(y) the Redemption Price, which may be reduced in the case of certain dilutive events (the Reset Price ). 

Upon
the Maturity Date, the Company is obligated to pay the Backstop Parties an amount equal to the product of (i) the maximum number of shares
of less the number of Terminated Shares by (ii) (the Maturity Consideration ). The Company can pay the Maturity
Consideration in cash or shares of the Company s common stock if certain conditions are met. 

The
Backstop Parties have purchased a fixed total of of the Company s common stock, referred to herein as the Backstop
Shares. The Backstop Parties Optional Early Termination economically results in the Backstop Agreement operating in substance
to grant the Backstop Parties a put option with the right to sell all or a portion of the Backstop Shares. Over the
three-year maturity period, the Company is entitled to either a return of the Prepayment, the underlying shares, or a combination thereof,
at the sole discretion of the Backstop Parties. 

For
further information regarding the Backstop Agreement, refer to Note 3, Business Combination and Backstop Agreement . 

Backstop
Put Option Liability and Fixed Maturity Consideration 

The
Backstop Agreement consists of two financial instruments that are accounted for as follows: 

(i) 
 The
 in-substance written put option which is recorded in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements as the
 Backstop Put Option Liability and treated as a derivative liability recorded at fair value with changes in fair value
 recognized in net loss. The Company measures the fair value of the Backstop Put Option Liability on a recurring basis, with any fair
 value adjustment recorded within other income (expense) in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Refer to Note 4, Fair
 Value Measurements , for further detail. 

(ii) 
 The
 Fixed Maturity Consideration representing the 
 in maximum shares less the 
 Backstop Shares multiplied by .
 The Company has elected to measure the Fixed Maturity Consideration using the Fair Value Option FVO under ASC 825, Financial
 Instruments . The Company measures the fair value of the Fixed Maturity Consideration on a recurring basis, with any fair value
 adjustment recorded within other income (expense) in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Refer to Note 4, Fair
 Value Measurements , for further detail. 

The
Prepayment is accounted for as a reduction to equity to reflect the substance of the overall arrangement as a net purchase of the Backstop
Shares and sales of shares to the Backstop Parties. 

million, in a private placement. On May 25, 2023, the Company consummated the closing for the sale of (i) the initial
Note in the principal amount of million (referred to in this Report as the 2023 Convertible Note and (ii) a warrant
to initially acquire up to additional shares of the Company s common stock with an initial exercise price of per
share of common stock, subject to adjustment, exercisable immediately and expiring from the date of issuance (the SPA
Warrant ). 

The
Company has elected to account for the Notes at fair value under the fair value option, under which the Notes are initially measured
at fair value and subsequently remeasured during each reporting period. Changes in fair value are reflected within other income
(expense) in the condensed consolidated financial statements, except for the portions, if any, related to the instrument specific
credit risk which would be recorded in other comprehensive income. 

Further,
the Company concluded that the investor s right to acquire additional Notes is separately exercisable from the 2023 Convertible
Note and the SPA Warrant. If and when the additional Notes are issued, the Company will evaluate whether to account for such additional
Notes at (a) fair value under the fair value option or (b) an amortized cost. Refer to Note 7, Senior Secured Convertible Notes ,
for further detail on the terms of the Notes and potential future issuances. 

In
addition, the Company determined that the SPA Warrant was (i) freestanding from the 2023 Convertible Note and (ii) classified as a
derivative liability. Accordingly, upon issuance the SPA Warrant was measured at fair value with an offset to cash proceeds from the
2023 Convertible Note, with the remainder of 
million recorded to other income (expense) on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company reassesses the
classification of the SPA Warrant at each reporting period and records any changes to fair value as necessary. To date, there have
been no changes in classification. 

In
addition to the liabilities recorded for the 2023 Convertible Note and the SPA Warrant, the Company also recorded a liability for
the purchase option within the SPA in favor of the investor (the Ayrton Note Purchase Option ), which gives the
investor, at its option through 2025, the right to purchase from the Company additional Notes (up to the sum of the aggregate
principal amount) at one or more additional closings. The initial recognition of this liability was measured at fair value utilizing
the Black-Scholes Merton model and the fair value of 
million was recorded to other income (expense) on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The liability is recorded
within current liabilities on the Company s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023. The liability is remeasured at
each reporting period and the Company records any changes to fair value as necessary. 

If the Company is a smaller reporting company at the time that it ceases to be an emerging growth company, the Company
may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically,
as a smaller reporting company, the Company may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements
in its Annual Report on Form 10-K and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations
regarding executive compensation. 

shares, with an aggregate value equal to million, of AHAC s Class A common stock to
 the holders of Legacy Ocean s securities immediately prior to the Closing, in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding
 capital stock of Legacy Ocean. The aggregate value was adjusted as required by the Business Combination Agreement to take into account
 net working capital, closing net debt and Legacy Ocean transaction expenses. 

The
 shares of AHAC Class B common stock held by Aesther Healthcare Sponsor, LLC (the Sponsor were immediately prior to the Closing. 

The
 Backstop Parties (as defined below within Backstop Agreement purchased shares of AHAC s Class A common stock
 prior to the Closing that are subject to the Backstop Agreement (these shares, referred to as the Recycled Shares, 
 and the Backstop Agreement are both further discussed and defined below). 

AHAC
 issued an additional shares of Class A common stock to the Sponsor prior to the Closing in consideration for obtaining
 extensions beyond the September 2022 deadline to complete an initial business combination. 

The
 Backstop Parties purchased shares of AHAC s Class A common stock in the open market for an aggregate purchase price
 of million prior to the Closing (the Share Consideration Shares ).

The
Company has concluded that the Earnout Shares represent a freestanding equity-linked financial instrument as the arrangement (i) can
be indexed to the Company s stock and (ii) meets all of the criteria for equity classification within ASC 815-40. The Company performed
the two-step analysis described within ASC 815-40-15 to determine indexation and noted that while the arrangement does contain contingencies,
these contingencies are based on the market for the Company s stock and do not preclude indexation.

the fair value of the Earnout Shares offset within additional paid-in capital, there is no inherent impact to the condensed consolidated
financial statements. Since the Earnout Shares are contingent on the Company s stock price, there will be no impact to outstanding
shares and will not represent participating securities until the time at which the contingencies have been met.

Agreement 

As
discussed in Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , on August 31, 2022, AHAC and Legacy

further discussed in Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , the Company agreed to purchase
the unsold portion of the Backstop Shares from the Backstop Parties on a forward basis upon the Maturity Date. The purchase price payable
by the Company includes a Prepayment from the proceeds released from the trust account related to those shares. Upon the Maturity Date,
the Company is obligated to pay the Backstop Parties an amount equal to the product of (i) the maximum number of shares of

to Closing, the Prepayment amount was equal to million, consisting of million for the Recycled Shares and million for
the Polar Subscription shares. As the million was a netted transaction between the Company and Polar, only million was paid
out of the funds the Company received from AHAC s trust account. This net impact from the payment outflow to Backstop Parties for
the Backstop Agreement of million and the proceeds inflow from the issuance of common stock pursuant to the Backstop Agreement
and Polar Subscription of million are reported in the Company s condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. The Prepayment
amount was accounted for as a reduction to equity to reflect the substance of the overall arrangement as a net purchase of the Backstop
Shares. 

The
Backstop Agreement consists of two financial instruments that are accounted for as follows: 

(i) 
 The
 in-substance written put option which is recorded in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements as the Backstop
 Put Option Liability and treated as a derivative liability recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in
 net loss. The Company measures the fair value of the Backstop Put Option Liability on a recurring basis, with any fair value adjustment
 recorded within other income/(expense) in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Refer to Note 4, Fair Value Measurements ,
 for further detail. 

(ii)

 ASC 825, Financial Instruments . The Company measures the fair value of the Fixed Maturity Consideration on a recurring basis,
 with any fair value adjustment recorded within other income/(expense) in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Refer
 to Note 4, Fair Value Measurements , for further detail. 

The
Prepayment is accounted for as a reduction to equity to reflect the substance of the overall arrangement as a net purchase of the Backstop
Shares and sales of shares to the Backstop Parties. 

. 

On
May 23, 2023 the Company received an Equity Prepaid Forward Transaction - Valuation Date Notice Notice from Vellar stating
that due to the Company s alleged failure to timely register the shares held by Vellar, Vellar had the right to terminate the Backstop
Agreement as to their portion of the shares and Vellar claimed that it is entitled to receive Maturity Consideration (as defined in the
Backstop Agreement) equal to million, which at the Company s discretion may be paid in cash or by offset to the shares currently
held by Vellar. Management takes issue with multiple aspects of the Notice including, but not limited to, Vellar s right to terminate
their portion of the Backstop Agreement and their asserted Maturity Consideration calculation. As such, the Company is consulting with
advisors and other parties and is considering the potential resources and remedies it may elect to pursue and intends to assert its rights
should this matter not be resolved. After a review of all applicable documents related to the Backstop Agreement, the Company believes
its position with respect to the terms of the Backstop Agreement and intent of the parties is supported by the Backstop Agreement and
facts and circumstances under which it was entered into. Further, given the early stage of this matter and the uncertainty inherent in
litigation and investigations, the Company does not currently believe it is (i) probable to incur losses or (ii) possible to develop
estimates of reasonably possible losses (or a range of possible losses) for this matter. 

On
October 2, 2023, the Company entered into a Side Letter Agreement (the Side Letter with Polar. The Side Letter amended
certain terms of the Polar Agreement, as discussed in Note 3, Business Combination and Backstop Agreement. The Side Letter amended the
definitions of Seller VWAP Trigger Event and Reset Price as used in the Backstop Agreement as it relates
to Polar and the Polar Agreement. Per the amended definitions, the (i) Seller VWAP Trigger Event is an event that occurs
if the VWAP price is below per share for any 20 trading days during a 30 consecutive trading day-period thereafter and (ii) the
 Reset Price is defined as . The Side Letter did not amend any terms of the Backstop Agreement as it relates to the
other Backstop Parties. 

The
 Seller VWAP Trigger Event for Polar occurred in October 2023 and the other Backstop Parties in November 2023. The Company
received written notice from Polar on November 6, 2023, acknowledging its right to designate any date as the Maturity Date from the date
of the notice to, and including, the third anniversary of the Business Combination. As of the date of this filing, one of the Backstop
Parties, Polar had not designated a Maturity Date. Refer to above in this footnote for further detail around the purported Maturity Date
for Vellar.

value.

commitment shares to White Lion, which had a fair value of million upon issuance. The million in commitment costs was recorded

initially acquire up to additional shares of the Company s common stock with an initial exercise price of per share
of common stock, subject to adjustment, exercisable immediately and expiring from the date of issuance (the SPA Warrant ).
Each Note will be sold at an original issue discount of . Future issuances of Notes Additional Closings are subject
to satisfaction of certain conditions. At the closing of the first Additional Closing, million in principal amount of Notes will
be issued (the First Additional Closing Date and million in principal amount of Notes will be issued at the closing
of the second Additional Closing. So long as any Notes remain outstanding, the Company and each of its subsidiaries are prohibited from
effecting or entering into an agreement to affect any subsequent placement involving a Variable Rate Transaction, as defined within the
SPA, other than pursuant to the White Lion Common Stock Purchase Agreement. 

The
interest rate applicable to each Note is, as of any date of determination, the lesser of Each Note will mature on the first anniversary of its issuance. 

All
or any portion of the principal amount of each Note, plus accrued and unpaid interest is convertible at any time, in whole or in part,
at the noteholder s option, into shares of the Company s common stock at an initial fixed conversion price of per
share, subject to certain adjustments and alternative conditions. A noteholder will not have the right to convert any portion of a Note,
to the extent that, after giving effect to such conversion, the noteholder (together with certain of its affiliates and other related
parties) would beneficially own in excess of of the shares of the Company s common stock outstanding immediately after giving
effect to such conversion. Upon a change of control of the Company, noteholders may require the Company to redeem all, or any portion,
of the Notes at a price stipulated by certain conditions as discussed within the SPA. At March 31, 2024, the principal amount outstanding
under the 2023 Convertible Note was million.

failure of Dr. Chirinjeev Kathuria to be the chairman of the Company s Board of Directors. In connection with an event of default,
the noteholders may require the Company to redeem all or any portion of the Notes, at a premium set forth in the SPA. 

The
Company is subject to certain customary affirmative and negative covenants regarding the rank of the Notes, the incurrence of indebtedness,
the existence of liens, the repayment of indebtedness and the making of investments, the payment of cash in respect of dividends, distributions
or redemptions, the transfer of assets, the maturity of other indebtedness, and transactions with affiliates, among other customary matters.
The Company is also subject to financial covenants requiring that (i) the amount of the Company s available cash equals or exceeds
 million at the time of each Additional Closing; (ii) the ratio of (a) the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, accrued and
unpaid interest thereon, and accrued and unpaid late charges to (b) the Company s average market capitalization over the prior

a Current Calendar Month (x) the available cash on the last calendar day in such Current Calendar Month shall be greater
than or equal to the available cash on the last calendar day of the month prior to such Current Calendar Month less million. 

The
Company has elected to account for the Notes at fair value under the fair value option, under which the Notes were initially
measured at fair value and subsequently re-measured during each reporting period. Changes in fair value were reflected within other
income (expense) in the condensed consolidated financial statements, except for the portions, if any, related to the instrument
specific credit risk which would be recorded in other comprehensive income. 

Further,
the Company concluded that the right to acquire additional Notes is separately exercisable from the 2023 Convertible Note and the SPA
Warrant. If and when the additional Notes are issued, the Company will evaluate whether to account for such additional Notes at (a) fair
value under the fair value option or (b) an amortized cost. 

In
addition, the Company determined that the SPA Warrant was (i) freestanding from the 2023 Convertible Note and (ii) classified as a
derivative liability. Accordingly, upon issuance the SPA Warrant was measured at fair value with an offset to cash proceeds from the
2023 Convertible Note, with the remainder of 
million recorded to other income/(expense) on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company reassess the
classification of the SPA Warrant at each reporting period and records any changes to fair value to other income (expense) on the
condensed consolidated statement of operations. To date, there have been no changes to the classification of the SPA
Warrant. 

In
addition to the liabilities recorded for the 2023 Convertible Note and the SPA Warrant, the Company also recorded a liability for
the Ayrton Note Purchase Option, which gives the Investor, at its option through 2025, the right to purchase from the Company
additional Notes (up to the sum of the aggregate principal amount) at one or more Additional Closings. The initial recognition of
this liability was measured at fair value utilizing the Black-Scholes Merton model and the fair value of 
million was recorded to other income (expense) on the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal quarter ended
June 30, 2023. The liability was recorded within current liabilities on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet as
of June 30, 2023. The liability is remeasured at each reporting period and the Company records any changes to other income
(expense) on the consolidated statement of operations. As of December 31, 2023, it was determined that the fair value of the Ayrton
Note Purchase Option was zero. 

The
Company issued 
shares of its common stock to the Investor during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as interest payments. A total of 
million was recorded to other income (expense) for the shares issued based on the grant date fair values.

License
Fees 

The
Company has entered into license agreements with its academic research institution partners. Under these license agreements, the Company
is required to make annual fixed license maintenance fee payments. The Company is also required to make payments upon successful completion
and achievement of certain milestones as well as royalty payments upon sales of products covered by such licenses. The payment obligations
under the license and collaboration agreements are contingent upon future events such as achievement of specified development, clinical,
regulatory, and commercial milestones. As the timing of these future milestone payments are not known, the Company has not included these
fees in the consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023.

Contingent
Compensation and Other Contingent Payments 

Under
the management employment agreements, we have salaries and bonuses that are contingently payable upon financing, collectively called
contingent compensation, that are contingently payable based only upon our first cumulative capital raise of at least million. As
of March 31, 2024, we have contingent compensation and bonuses in the amount of million to certain members of senior management. 

We
also have million of contingent vendor payments, which are also contingently payable based only upon our first cumulative capital
raise of at least million. 

These
amounts will not be paid if the contingencies do not occur. Since the payment of obligations under these agreements are contingent
upon these future events, which are not considered probable as such future events are deemed outside of our control, we have not
included these amounts in our condensed consolidated financial statements. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, 
million of contingent compensation was paid and recorded in general and administrative expenses on the Company s consolidated
statement of operations. There have not been any contingent compensation payments for the three months ended March 31, 2024.

Virion
Contribution Agreement 

On
October 11, 2023, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Contribution Agreement (the Contribution Agreement with Virion Therapeutics, LLC Virion and Poseidon Bio LLC to provide financial, technical and operational assistance
to the further growth and development of Virion s Intelligent and Adaptable CD8+ T cell-based Immunotherapy VIACT platform. Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, the Company acquired a 
membership interest in Virion and purchased one membership unit of Virion for an initial contribution of either a) 
million in cash, or b) 
shares of the Company s common stock, 
of which were transferred to Virion by Poseidon Bio LLC, with the remaining 
shares issued by the Company on December 1, 2023. The Company elected to fund the initial contribution via the issuance of shares of
its common stock. In the case of an initial contribution in the form of shares of common stock, the Contribution Agreement provides
for a post-closing true-up 18 months from the closing date, whereby the Company would be required to make a true-up contribution.
This post-closing true-up amount would be equal to the difference between liquidation proceeds received by Virion from the sale of
the 
shares of common stock received in the initial contribution and 
million. The post-closing true-up amount is payable, at the Company s discretion, in the form of additional shares of the
Company s common stock, or cash. This investment has been reflected at the minimum amount to be contributed as of the
post-closing true-up, or 
million and is reflected in non-current assets on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets as Investment in Virion.
The Company initially recorded a liability of 
million for the estimated amount of the post-closing true-up, reflecting the 
million reduced by the fair market value of the common stock issued pursuant to the Contribution Agreement at the time of the
contribution. The liability will be remeasured at each reporting period and the Company will record any changes to other
income (expense) on the consolidated statement of operations. Based upon the closing price of the Company s common stock at
March 31, 2024, the Company decreased the liability for the post-closing true-up to 
million and reflected a gain of 
million for the change in the fair value of the Virion Contribution Liability in other income/(expense) on its consolidated
statement of operations. 

The
investment in Virion is accounted for as an equity method investment under ASC 323 as the Company has significant influence over the
investee. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, Virion incurred a net loss of approximately million. The Company recorded its
share of this loss of approximately million for the three months ended March 31, 2024.

2022
Stock Option and Incentive Plan 

The
Company s Board of Directors the Board approved and adopted the 2022 Stock Option and Incentive Plan and Form of
Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement for Non-Employee Directors (the Incentive Plan prior to the Closing of the Business
Combination. 

The
maximum number of shares of common stock that may be initially issued or transferred pursuant to awards under the Incentive Plan equals
 shares (the Share Limit ). The Share Limit will automatically increase on the first trading day in January of
each calendar year during the term of the Incentive Plan, with the first such increase to occur in January 2024, by an amount equal to
the lesser of (i) three percent (3 of the total number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding on December 31 of the immediately
preceding calendar year or (ii) such number of shares of common stock as may be established by the Board. 

The
Incentive Plan authorizes stock options, stock appreciation rights, and other forms of awards granted or denominated in the Company s
common stock or units of the Company s common stock, as well as cash bonus awards. The Incentive Plan retains flexibility to offer
competitive incentives and to tailor benefits to specific needs and circumstances. Any award may be structured to be paid or settled
in cash. Any awards under the Incentive Plan (including awards of stock options and stock appreciation rights) may be fully vested at
grant or may be subject to time- and/or performance-based vesting requirements. 

The
Incentive Plan does not limit the authority of the Board or any committee to grant awards or authorize any other compensation, with or
without reference to the Company s common stock, under any other plan or authority. The Board may amend or terminate the Incentive
Plan at any time and in any manner. Stockholder approval for an amendment will be required only to the extent then required by applicable
law or deemed necessary or advisable by the Board. Unless terminated earlier by the Board and subject to any extension that may be approved
by stockholders, the authority to grant new awards under the Incentive Plan will terminate on the tenth anniversary of its establishment. 

Stock
Options to Non-Employee Directors 

Under
the Non-employee Director Compensation Policy, upon initial election or appointment to the Board, each new non-employee director will
be granted under the Incentive Plan a one-time grant of a non-statutory stock option to purchase shares of its common stock on
the date of such director s election or appointment to the Board, issuable under the incentive plan. These will vest in substantially
equal monthly installments over three years, subject to the director s continued service as a member of the Board through each
applicable vesting date. 

On
February 15, 2023, options were granted to each of the non-employee directors at a strike price of per share. 

The
estimated fair value of a non-statutory stock option to purchase common stock on the grant date was per share and was determined
using the Black-Scholes Merton model. The valuation used the following assumptions: 

Expected
volatility : 

Expected
term : years 

Risk-Free
Interest Rate : 

Dividend
Yield : The Company has not declared or paid dividends to date and does not anticipate declaring dividends. As such, the dividend
yield has been estimated to be . 

The
stock-based compensation expense recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2024, was million and was recorded within general
and administrative expense in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations, as discussed below. 

Options granted 

Options cancelled or forfeited 

Outstanding at March 31, 2024 

The
aggregate intrinsic value in the above table is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the Company s common stock
as of March 31, 2024 and the exercise price of the stock options. As of March 31, 2024, the total unrecognized compensation related to
unvested stock option awards granted was million, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of approximately
 years. stock options were exercised during the period. 

2022
Employee Stock Purchase Plan 

The
Board approved and adopted the 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP prior to the Closing of the Business Combination. 

Subject
to adjustment, shares of common stock are available for purchase pursuant to the exercise of options under the ESPP. Shares
to be delivered upon exercise of options under the ESPP may be authorized but unissued stock, treasury stock, or stock acquired in an
open-market transaction. Subject to certain requirements and exceptions, all individuals classified as employees on the payroll records
of the Company, or its subsidiaries are eligible to participate in any one or more of the offerings under the ESPP. 

The
ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of common stock during specified offering periods, with such offering periods not to
exceed 27 months. During each offering period, eligible employees will be granted an option to purchase shares of common stock on the
last business day of the offering period. The purchase price of each share of common stock issued pursuant to the exercise of an option
under the ESPP on an exercise date will be (or such greater percentage as specified by the administrator of the ESPP) of the lesser
of: (a) the fair market value of a share of common stock date the option is granted, which will be the first day of the offering period,
and (b) the fair market value of a share of common stock on the exercise date, which will the last business day of the offering period. 

The
Board has discretion to amend the ESPP to any extent and in any manner, it may deem advisable, provided that any amendment that would
be treated as the adoption of a new plan for purposes of Section 423 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code will require stockholder approval. The Board may suspend or terminate the ESPP at any time. No purchases were made as of March 31, 2024. 

Profit
Interests in Poseidon 

Legacy
Ocean s founder and then sole stockholder was issued shares of Legacy Ocean s common stock Founders Shares upon the formation of Legacy Ocean on January 2, 2019. After inception and prior to the Business Combination, the majority of the Founders
Shares were contributed to Poseidon Bio, LLC Poseidon ), with Poseidon subsequently granting Class A and Class B profit
interests to Legacy Ocean s founder and other certain executives and employees, respectively, and resulting in Legacy Ocean s
founder holding of the voting power of Poseidon. Further, after inception and prior to the Business Combination, Legacy Ocean implemented
reverse stock splits which are appropriately reflected as applicable to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 

These
profit interests grants in the Company s controlling shareholder were deemed to be transactions incurred by the shareholder and
within the scope of ASC 718, Stock Compensation . As a result, the related transactions by the shareholder were pushed down into
the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. As of March 31, 2024, Legacy Ocean s founder held of the
voting power and of the equity interests in Poseidon. The related stock-based compensation recognized is discussed below. 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

The
Company recognizes stock-based compensation costs for equity-based compensation awards granted to employees, nonemployees, and directors
in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company estimates the fair value and the resulting amounts using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
The fair value is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods but accelerated to the extent that grants vest
sooner than on a straight-line basis. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur and requires management to make a number of other assumptions,
including the volatility of the underlying shares, the risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends. Expected volatility is based
on the historical share volatility of a set of comparable publicly traded companies over a period of time equal to the expected term
of the grant or option. 

Stock-based
compensation for the three months ended March 31, 2024, consisted of costs related to (i) stock options granted to non-employee directors
in the first quarter of 2023 and (ii) warrants issued to advisors and consultants, as discussed below. Stock-based compensation for the
three months ended March 31, 2024, solely consisted of costs related to the profit interests in Poseidon. The following table summarizes
the allocation of stock-based compensation for the stock options, warrants, and Class B profit interests for the three months ended March
31, 2024 and 2023, respectively:

 At the time of issuance, these warrants were recorded as a liability and as Second Street Capital had the intention to exercise the
 put option in the near-term, the Company determined that recording the liability at its fair value of was appropriate. 

(3) 

(4) 

In
2022 and 2023, the Company entered into certain agreements with Second Street Capital, Special Forces F9, LLC Special Forces ),
and McKra for which it issued warrants exercisable to purchase the Company s common stock. For each of the warrants issued, the
Company utilized the guidance within ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity to determine whether the instruments
should be recorded as liabilities or as equity. For warrants that are fully vested upon issuance with a fixed life term, the instrument
is classified as equity and the Company recognizes the estimated fair value of the warrant within equity on the date of grant, with the
offset be recorded within (i) other income/(expense) for those issued in conjunction with loans and (ii) stock-based compensation within
operating expenses for those issued to advisors and consultants. Further, for any warrants that are issued in connection with a loan
and are not fully vested upon issuance, the fair value of the debt issuance is amortized over the set term. The estimated fair value
for the equity-classified warrants is determined utilizing the Black-Scholes Merton model, as described below. For the warrant with a
put option, the Company recorded a corresponding liability in its condensed consolidated balance sheets as discussed above. 

In
addition, the Company has Public Warrants and Private Warrants that were assumed in connection with the closing of the Business Combination.
They are treated as equity-classified instruments, as discussed below. 

The
use of the Black-Scholes Merton model requires management to make the following assumptions: 

Expected
volatility : The Company estimates volatility for warrants issued by evaluating the average historical volatility of a peer group
of companies for a period of time equal to the expected term of the warrants. 

Expected
term : Derived from the life of the warrants issued and is based on the simplified method which is essentially the weighted average
of the vesting period and contractual term. 

Risk-Free
Interest Rate : The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues,
with a term that is equal to the warrants expected term at the grant date. 

Dividend
Yield : The Company has not declared or paid dividends to date and does not anticipate declaring dividends. As such, the dividend
yield has been estimated to be zero. 

The
fair value is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods but accelerated to the extent that grants vest sooner
than on a straight-line basis. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur and requires management to make a number of other assumptions,
including the volatility of the underlying shares, the risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends. Expected volatility is based
on the historical share volatility of a set of comparable publicly traded companies over a period of time equal to the expected term
of the grant. 

Prior
to the Business Combination, Legacy Ocean estimated the fair value of its common stock considering, among other things, contemporaneous
valuations for its common stock prepared by third-party valuation firms and prices set forth in Legacy Ocean s previous filings
with the SEC for a proposed IPO of its common stock that was not pursued by Legacy Ocean. Upon execution of the Business Combination
Agreement in September 2022, the value of the Second Street Warrants was based on the closing price of AHAC s Class A common stock
as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the grant date. 

Following
the Closing of the Business Combination, the value of warrants issued by the Company was based on the closing price of its common
stock as reported on the Nasdaq Capital Market on the grant date. The Company estimates the fair value, based upon these values,
using the Black-Scholes Merton model, which is affected principally by the life of the warrant, the volatility of the underlying
shares, the risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends. Expected volatility is based on the historical share volatility of a
set of comparable publicly traded companies over a period of time equal to the expected term of the warrants. The risk-free interest
rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the warrant for time periods
approximately equal to the expected term of the warrant. Expected dividend yield is zero based on the fact that the Company has
never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The Company expenses the amount
for warrants and stock-based awards within other income (expense) and stock-based compensation within operating expenses, as
applicable, in its condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

Second
Street Warrants 

In
connection with the Second Street Loans discussed in Note 6, Short-Term Loan Agreements , the Company issued a total of eight
warrants exercisable to purchase an aggregate of 
shares of its common stock to Second Street Capital (including the Converted Ocean Warrants, as discussed above). During the three
months ended March 31, 2023, the Company recognized 
million in other income (expense) in its condensed consolidated statements of operations to record the issuance of warrants based on
the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. 

The
warrant issued in connection with the March Second Street Loan, exercisable for 
shares of the Company s common stock, was treated as a debt discount and the respective fair value is being amortized over the
life of the term of the loan. For those warrants issued in exchange for maturity extensions, the Company concluded that they met the
accounting requirements for debt extinguishments and as such the fair values of the warrants, as well as related fees, were recorded
in full to other income (expense) in the period of issuance, with the offset to additional paid-in capital. There was no related
expense recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2024, all of the warrants remain
outstanding. 

McKra
Investments III Warrant 

In
connection with the McKra Loan, discussed in Note 6, Short-Term Loan Agreements, the Company issued a warrant exercisable to purchase
 shares of its common stock. The warrant is being treated as a debt discount and the fair value is being amortized over the life
of the term of the warrant. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company recognized million in other income/(expense)
in its condensed consolidated statements of operations based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. There was
no related expense recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2024, the warrant remains outstanding. 

Special
Forces F9 Warrant 

In
connection with a strategic advisory agreement, dated March 19, 2023, between the Company and Special Forces, the Company issued to Special
Forces a warrant to purchase shares of its common stock with an exercise price of per share exercisable until March 7,
2028. Warrants issued to advisors and consultants are also considered stock-based compensation. The estimated fair value of the warrant
to purchase common stock on the grant date was per share and was determined using the Black-Scholes Merton model. 

In
the first quarter of 2023, the full amount of the million of the fair value of the warrant was recognized since the warrant was
fully vested upon issuance. The fair value was recorded as stock-based compensation within general and administrative expense on the
Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations. As of March 31, 2024, the warrant remains outstanding. 

SPA
Warrant 

In
connection with the Ayrton Convertible Note Financing, the Company issued to an accredited investor a warrant exercisable for 
shares of its common stock. Refer to Note 7, Senior Secured Convertible Notes , for further detail. 

Public
and Private Warrants 

The
Company has a total of outstanding warrants to purchase one share of its common stock with an exercise price of per
share. Of these warrants, were originally issued in AHAC s IPO (the Public Warrants and were
originally issued in a private placement in connection with the IPO (the Private Warrants, and together with the Public
Warrants, the IPO Warrants ). 

Each
whole IPO Warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one share of common stock at a price of per share, subject to adjustment
as discussed within the underlying agreements, at any time commencing 30 days after the completion of the Business Combination. However,
the IPO Warrants are not exercisable for cash unless the Company has an effective and current registration statement covering the shares
of common stock issuable upon exercise of the IPO Warrants. 

The
Company may call the IPO Warrants for redemption, in whole and not in part, at a price of per warrant: 

at
 any time after the warrants become exercisable; 

upon
 not less than 30 days prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder; 

if,
 and only if, the reported last sale price of the shares of common stock equals or exceeds per share (as adjusted for stock
 splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations), for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading-day period commencing
 after the warrants become exercisable and ending on the third business day prior to the notice of redemption to warrant holders;
 and 

if,
 and only if, there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the shares of common stock underlying such warrants. 

The
right to exercise will be forfeited unless the IPO Warrants are exercised prior to the date specified in the notice of redemption. On
and after the redemption date, a record holder of an IPO Warrant will have no further rights except to receive the redemption price for
such holder s warrant upon surrender of such warrant. If the Company calls the IPO Warrants for redemption as described above,
its management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise warrants to do so on a cashless basis. 
In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of shares of the Company s
common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of common stock underlying the warrants,
multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the fair market value (defined below) by (y)
the fair market value. The fair market value for this purpose shall mean the average reported last sale price of the shares
of common stock for the five trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent
to the holders of warrants. 

For
accounting purposes, the Company accounts for the IPO Warrants (i) in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 480-10-25-8 and ASC
815-40 and (ii) classified as an equity instrument. The fair values of the IPO Warrants were accounted for as deemed dividends. Since
the entries to recognize the fair value of the IPO Warrants offset within additional paid-in capital, there is no inherent impact to
the condensed consolidated financial statements.

Share Consideration 

In
connection with a Marketing Services Agreement, dated March 7, 2023, between the Company and Outside The Box Capital OTBC ), the Company issued to OTBC

Inc. s (the Company, Ocean Biomedical, we, us and our condensed
consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Report and the audited consolidated financial statements
and related notes thereto included in Exhibit 99.2 our Amendment No. 2 to Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 31, 2023. The information

Overview 

We
are a biopharmaceutical company that seeks to bridge the bench-to-bedside gap between medical research discoveries and
patient solutions. We do this by leveraging our strong relationships with research universities and medical centers to license their
inventions and technologies with the goal of developing them into products that address diseases with significant unmet medical needs.
We believe that our differentiated business model positions us to capture inventions created at these institutions that might otherwise
fail to be commercialized to benefit patients. Our team of accomplished scientists, business professionals and entrepreneurs bring together
the interdisciplinary expertise and resources required to develop and commercialize a diverse portfolio of assets. We are organized around
a licensing and subsidiary structure that we believe will enable us to create mutual value both for us and potential licensing partners.
We believe this structure, combined with the professional networks of our leadership team members, allows us to opportunistically build
a continuous pipeline of promising product innovations through our existing and potential future relationships with research institutions. 

Our
goal is to optimize value creation for each of our product candidates, and we intend to continuously assess the best pathway for each
as it progresses through the preclinical and clinical development process including through internal advancement, partnerships
with established companies and spinouts or other strategic transactions in order to benefit patients through the commercialization
of these products. Our current active assets are licensed from Brown University and Rhode Island Hospital. Our scientific co-founders
and members of our Board of Directors Board ), Dr. Jack A. Elias and Dr. Jonathan Kurtis, are both affiliated with Brown
University and with Rhode Island Hospital. Our strategy is to accelerate the flow of the academic discoveries, and the required clinical
development required for these product candidates and advance them commercially. The number of potential opportunities at research universities
and medical centers is large, but only a small fraction of these opportunities is currently tapped in the market. The gap remains wide,
and we believe this presents an attractive opportunity for us to become an industry leader by addressing a need to accelerate the advancement
of therapeutics that can address significant unmet medical needs. The core elements that we believe differentiate our business model
include: 

Harnessing
 inventions and technologies from research universities and medical centers. We are experienced at identifying and sourcing breakthrough
 discoveries at academic and research institutions, including our current partnerships with Brown University and Rhode Island Hospital. 

37 

Developing
 new drug therapies through an operationally efficient, evidence-based and milestone- driven approach. Once we select an asset
 for development, we pursue what we believe are appropriate development strategies that we aim to execute efficiently by leveraging
 contract research organizations CROs and contract manufacturing organizations CMOs ), and other drug
 development experts and consultants. 

Building
 a diverse portfolio of product candidates. We are evidence-based and program agnostic, meaning that our resources are driven
 strictly by program progress and milestone achievements. Our approach is to develop multiple diverse programs in parallel which mitigates
 business risk. 

Providing
 attractive economic upside to our partners at research universities and medical centers. We have a structure wherein our parent
 company houses each program in a subsidiary. We believe this structure is optimal to provide attractive economic incentives to the
 discovering institution and its researchers. 

Employing
 a multi-disciplinary approach to drug discovery and development across our programs . Our business model is based on bringing
 together the appropriate disciplines and expertise needed for each of our programs and leveraging learnings across programs and disease
 areas. 

Exploiting
 multiple commercialization options to maximize each program s value. Throughout the development of our product candidates,
 we plan to continually assess that program s potential paths to market, and we will endeavor to identify and maximize commercial
 value through various options, including internal advancement, partnerships with established companies, and spin-outs or other strategic
 transactions. 

Leadership
 team comprised of academic, scientific and business innovators . We have assembled an industry-leading, multi-disciplinary team
 consisting of physicians, scientists and business leaders with significant experience in progressing product candidates from early-stage
 research through clinical trials, regulatory approval and ultimately to commercialization. Although our company has not yet developed
 or commercialized any biopharmaceutical products, key members of our management team have experience doing so in previous endeavors. 

We
believe our differentiated business model will enable us to commercialize our products, if approved, and will allow us to replicate our
licensing partnerships through aligned incentive structures with research universities and medical centers. 

Our
pipeline consists of clinical-stage programs. We anticipate moving certain preclinical product candidates in our oncology, fibrosis and/or
infectious disease programs into the clinic in the next 12 to 24 months. 

Since
Legacy Ocean s inception in 2019, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to organizing, research and development activities,
business planning, building our intellectual property positions and providing general and administrative support for these operations.
We have not generated any revenue from product sales. 

We
have incurred significant operating losses since inception. Our ability to generate product revenues sufficient to achieve
profitability will depend heavily upon the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our current
products or any future products. Our net losses were 72.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. We reflected net
income of 13.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily due to a gain recognized in connection with the
Backstop Put Option Liability and Fixed Maturity Consideration. As of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had a
stockholders deficit of 75.8 million and 90.8 million, respectively. Our current liabilities are 30.1 million and 30.0
million as of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our current liabilities consisted of accrued expenses including
transaction costs, accounting and legal fees, accrued research and development costs, and short-term loans. We expect that our
expense and capital requirements will increase substantially in connection with ongoing activities to commercialize our products in
the future. 

38 

We
expect to continue to generate operating losses for the foreseeable future. Our future viability is dependent on the success of our research
and development and our ability to access additional capital to fund our operations. There can be no assurance that our current operating
plan will be achieved or that additional funding will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. 

We
are subject to risks and uncertainties common to early-stage companies in the biotechnology industry including, but not limited to, new
technological innovations, protection of proprietary technology, dependence on key personnel, compliance with government regulations,
and the ability to obtain additional capital to fund operations. Our therapeutic products will require significant additional research
and development efforts, including preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval prior to commercialization. These efforts
require additional capital, adequate personnel and extensive compliance reporting capabilities. There can be no assurance that our research
and development will be successfully completed, that adequate protection for our intellectual property will be obtained, that any products
developed will obtain necessary government regulatory approval, or that any approved products will be commercially viable. 

Basis
of Presentation 

The
Company s condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with US GAAP. See Note 2, Basis of Presentation
and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to our condensed consolidated financial statements for a full description of our
basis of presentation. 

Impacts
Market Conditions on Our Business 

Disruption
of global financial markets and a recession or market correction, the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the related
sanctions imposed against Russia, and other global macroeconomic factors such as inflation, could reduce the Company s ability
to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity and could materially affect our business and the value of
its common stock. 

Business
Combination Agreement with Aesther Healthcare Acquisition Corp. 

Closing
of Business Combination 

On
February 14, 2023, we consummated our previously announced Business Combination pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, at which
time AHAC Merger Sub Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of AHAC, merged with and into Legacy Ocean, with Legacy Ocean surviving the merger
as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In connection with the Closing, the Company changed its name from Aesther Healthcare
Acquisition Corp. to Ocean Biomedical, Inc. 

In
connection with the Closing (or immediately prior to, where indicated), among other things: 

We
 became a SEC-registrant, and our common stock and public warrants commenced trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market on February 15, 2023
 under the symbols OCEA and OCEAW, respectively. 

We
 issued to the holders of Legacy Ocean s securities as of immediately prior to the Closing approximately 23,355,432 shares of
 the Company s Class A common stock (with a per-share value of 10.00) with an aggregate value equal to 233.6 million, as adjusted
 as required by the Business Combination Agreement to take into account net working capital, closing net debt and Legacy Ocean s
 transaction expenses, in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Legacy Ocean. 

Holders
 of 5,570,965 shares of the Company s Class A common stock elected to redeem their shares immediately prior to Closing of the
 Business Combination for a full pro rata portion of the trust account holding the proceeds from AHAC s IPO. 

39 

2,625,000
 shares of AHAC s Class B common stock held by the Sponsor were converted on a one-for-one basis into 2,625,000 shares of AHAC s
 Class A common stock immediately prior to the Closing. 

AHAC
 issued an additional 1,365,000 shares of the Company s Class A common stock prior to the Closing in consideration for the Sponsor
 obtaining extensions beyond the September 16, 2022, deadline to complete an initial business combination. 

The
 Backstop Parties purchased 3,535,466 shares of the Company s Class A common stock prior to the closing that were not redeemed
 and are subject to the forward purchase provisions of the Backstop Agreement (the Recycled Shares ). 

The
 Backstop Parties purchased an additional 1,200,000 shares of the Company s Class A common stock prior to the Closing that were
 not redeemed (the Share Consideration Shares ). 

We
 issued three warrants to Second Street Capital exercisable to acquire that number of shares of our common stock equal to the economic
 value of the Legacy Ocean warrants previously issued to Second Street Capital in exchange for the termination of the Legacy Ocean
 warrants. The new warrants are exercisable for a total of 511,712 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 8.06 per share
 and 102,342 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 7.47 per share. 

We
 issued to Polar 1,350,000 newly issued shares of our common stock that are subject to the forward purchase provisions of the Backstop
 Agreement. 

On
 February 15, 2023, one day following the Closing, we paid the Prepayment of 51.6 million to the Backstop Parties utilizing funds
 from AHAC s trust account, pursuant to the terms of the Backstop Agreement, as discussed below. The total Prepayment includes
 37.3 million from the purchase of the Recycled Shares and 14.3 million from the purchase of the Share Consideration Shares. As
 the 14.3 million was a netted transaction between us and Polar, only 37.3 million was actually paid out of the funds received from
 the trust account. 

Each
 share of AHAC s Class A common stock was automatically reclassified into one share of the Company s common stock, including
 the remaining shares of AHAC Class A common stock that were not redeemed. 

The
Business Combination is accounted for as a reverse capitalization in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Under the guidance in ASC 805, Business
Combinations , AHAC is treated as the acquired company for financial reporting purposes. See Note 3, Business Combination
and Backstop Agreement , of our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional detail
about the Business Combination and related transactions. The Liquidity and Capital Resources section below also includes further
discussion of these transactions. 

As
a result of becoming a public company, we have begun and will continue to need to hire additional staff and implement processes and procedures
to address public company regulatory requirements and customary practices. We incurred and expect to continue to incur additional annual
expenses for, among other things, directors and officers liability insurance, director fees and additional internal and
external accounting, legal and administrative resources and fees. 

Components
of Our Results of Operations 

Revenue 

To
date, we have not generated any revenue from any sources, including from product sales, and we do not expect to generate any revenue
from the sale of products in the foreseeable future. If our development efforts for our product candidates are successful and result
in regulatory approval, or license agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from product sales. However,
there can be no assurance as to when we will generate such revenue, if at all. 

40 

Operating
Expenses 

Research
and Development Expenses 

To
date, research and development expenses consist, or will consist, primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including
the development of our product candidates, as well as stock-based compensation. We expense research and development costs as incurred,
which we expect will primarily include: 

expenses
 incurred under our licenses and services agreements; 

employee
 related expenses, including salaries and benefits for personnel engaged in research and development functions; and 

expenses
 incurred for outside services with our CMO relating to the development of certain of our preclinical assets. 

We
recognize external development costs based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific milestones using information provided
to us by our service providers. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel
to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred
for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. Such amounts are expensed as the related goods
are delivered or the related services are performed, or until it is no longer expected that the goods will be delivered, or the services
rendered. 

Our
direct external research and development expenses consist of (or are expected to consist) primarily of external costs, such as fees paid
to outside consultants, CROs, CMOs and research laboratories in connection with our preclinical development, process development, manufacturing
and clinical development activities. Our direct research and development expenses also include fees incurred under license agreements.
We have not allocated and do not expect to allocate employee costs, costs associated with our discovery efforts, laboratory supplies,
and facilities, including depreciation or other indirect costs, to specific programs because these costs are or will be deployed across
multiple programs and, as such, are not separately classified. We use internal resources primarily to conduct our research and discovery
as well as for managing our preclinical development, process development, manufacturing and clinical development activities. These employees
work across multiple programs and, therefore, we do not track their costs by program. 

Research
and development activities are key to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher
development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later stage
clinical trials. As a result, we expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially over the next several
years, which will include: 

expenses
 incurred under our licenses and services agreements to conduct the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials required to
 obtain regulatory approval; 

expenses
 incurred under agreements with CROs, that are primarily engaged in the oversight and conduct of our drug discovery efforts and preclinical
 studies, clinical trials and CMOs, that are primarily engaged to provide preclinical and clinical product for our research and development
 candidates; 

other
 costs related to acquiring and manufacturing materials in connection with our drug discovery efforts and preclinical studies and
 clinical trial materials, including manufacturing validation batches, as well as investigative sites and consultants that conduct
 our clinical trials, preclinical studies and other scientific development services; 

employee-related
 expenses, including salaries and benefits, and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development
 functions; and 

costs
 related to compliance with regulatory requirements. 

41 

At
this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the preclinical
and clinical development of any of our product candidates or when, if ever, material net cash inflows may commence from any of our product
candidates. The successful development and commercialization of our product candidates is highly uncertain. This uncertainty is due to
the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the following: 

scope,
 progress, outcome and costs of our preclinical development activities, clinical trials and other research and development activities; 

ability
 to successfully in-license attractive product candidates from our partners; 

establishing
 an appropriate safety and efficacy profile with Investigational New Drug, or IND, enabling studies; 

successful
 patient enrollment in and the initiation and completion of clinical trials; 

the
 timing, receipt and terms of approvals from applicable regulatory authorities including the FDA and other non-U.S. regulators; 

the
 extent of any required post-marketing approval commitments to applicable regulatory authorities; 

establishing
 clinical and commercial manufacturing capabilities with third-party manufacturers in order to ensure that we or our third-party manufacturers
 are able to produce product successfully; 

development
 and timely delivery of clinical-grade and commercial-grade drug formulations that can be used in our clinical trials and for commercial
 launch; 

launching
 commercial sales of our product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; 

maintaining
 a continued acceptable safety protocol of our product candidates following any approval; and 

significant
 and potential changing government regulations. 

Any
changes in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our product candidates in preclinical and clinical
development could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of these product candidates, such
as if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to delay our planned start of clinical trials or require us to conduct other clinical
trials or testing beyond those that we currently expect or if significant delays in enrollment in any of our planned clinical trials
occurred. Such delays or changes may require us to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical
development of that product candidate. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses consist, or will consist, primarily of salaries and benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense
for personnel in executive, business development, finance, legal, human resources, information technology, pre-commercial and support
personnel functions. General and administrative expenses also include direct and allocated facility-related costs, insurance costs, stock-based
compensation, and professional fees for internal and external accounting services, legal, patent, consulting, investor and public relations. 

We
anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued
research activities and development of our product candidates and prepare for potential commercialization activities. We also incur significantly
increased accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, tax, compliance with Nasdaq and SEC requirements, and director and officer insurance
costs as well as investor and public relations expenses associated with operating as a public company. If and when we believe a regulatory
approval of a product candidate appears likely, we anticipate an increase in payroll and other employee-related expenses as a result
of our preparation for commercial operations as it relates to the sales and marketing of that product candidate. 

42 

Income
Taxes 

Income
taxes are recorded in accordance with FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes , which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability
approach. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included
in the financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial
statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected
to reverse, and net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances
are provided, if based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized. We have recorded a full valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred income tax assets to zero. In the event
we were to determine that we would be able to realize some or all of our deferred income tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the
deferred income tax asset valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made. As a consequence, we have
recorded no income tax expense nor benefit for all years presented.

General
and administrative 

General
and administrative expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 decreased by 4.4 million, as compared to the three months ended
March 31, 2023. The 4.4 million decrease was primarily driven by decreases of (i) 3.5 million in professional service fees, (ii) 0.5
million in stock-based compensation, and (iii) 0.4 million in insurance and public relations expenses. 

Other
Income (Expense) 

Other
expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 decreased by 80.3 million, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. The
decrease of 80.3 million was primarily driven by (i) a 46.6 million decrease in the changes in fair values of the Fixed Maturity Consideration
and Backstop Put Option Liability and certain charges incurred in the prior year period which are not recurring in the three months ended
March 31, 2024, such as (i) 13.6 million related to loss on extinguishment of debt, (ii) 7.6 million of transaction costs, and (iii)
 12.7 million related to the share consideration shares issued during the three months ended March 31, 2023. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Overview 

Since
our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We have not yet commercialized any products and we do not expect to generate
revenue from sales of products for several years, if at all. We had no cash inflows from operating activities for the three months ended
March 31, 2024. Further, as of March 31, 2024, we had minimal cash and a working capital deficiency of 28.3 million. 

To
date, we have funded our operations from the proceeds from the issuance of common stock and debt, proceeds from the Backstop Agreement
and through self-funding by our founder and have limited current cash on hand to fund our operations. Based on our current operational
plans and assumptions, we expect that the net proceeds from the Backstop Agreement, the Ayrton Convertible Note Financing and future
debt and equity financings, including possibly under the Common Stock Purchase Agreement, as well as further deferrals of certain of
our accrued expenses and contingency payments due upon the closing of future financings, are required to fund operations into the third
quarter of 2024. As of March 31, 2024, we received 1.4 million in cumulative proceeds from the Backstop Agreement. 

44 

We
borrowed 13.5 million in the first half of 2023, including the proceeds from the initial Note under the Ayrton Convertible Note Financing,
the proceeds of which were used to pay the related-party loans and certain accrued expenses. We consummated the closing of the sale of
the initial Note on May 25, 2023, for approximately 6.1 million, net of expenses and issuance costs, which we used to pay the remainder
of our existing related-party loans and a portion of our existing short-term loans, totaling 1.6 million. As of March 31, 2024, the
principal of our remaining short-term loans outstanding was 12.6 million. 

There
is an economic disincentive for the Backstop Parties to sell shares of our common stock that are subject to the restrictions set forth
in the Backstop Agreement unless our common stock is trading above 10.34 per share (as it relates to certain of the Backstop Parties)
or 8.00 per share (as it relates to one of the Backstop Parties), which means that we need to assume that no cash will be returned to
us pursuant to any sales under the Backstop Agreement unless our common stock is trading above 8.00 and one or more of our Backstop
Parties are otherwise able to sell their shares. Based upon the level of funding that we receive from the foregoing sources, we will
determine the amount of accrued expenses and contingency payments that we will seek to have our vendors further defer and how much we
are able to spend on our operations. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our
available capital resources sooner than we expect, in which case, we would need to raise more capital and sooner than expected. We cannot
guarantee that we will be able to draw down additional loans under the Ayrton Convertible Note Financing or raise additional capital
on reasonable terms or at all, that our common stock will trade above 8.00, permitting one of the Backstop Parties to sell shares under
the Backstop Agreement, that our common stock will trade above 10.34, permitting the other Backstop Parties to sell shares under the
Backstop Agreement, that the Backstop Parties will sell any shares of our common stock held by them or elect to terminate the Backstop
Agreement in respect of those shares, or that our vendors will agree to further deferrals of payments due to them. Although the Common
Stock Purchase Agreement provides that we have the right, but not the obligation to require White Lion to purchase, from time to time,
up to 75.0 million in aggregate gross purchase price of Equity Line Shares, we are not required or permitted to issue any shares of
our common stock under the Common Stock Purchase Agreement if such sale would result in White Lion owning more than 9.99 of our outstanding
shares of common stock. 

Effective
October 4, 2023, the Company and White Lion entered into the first amendment of the Common Stock Purchase Agreement (the Amendment ).
The Amendment is intended to afford the Company greater flexibility and provide the Company an additional alternative to issue a fixed
price Purchase Notice under the Common Stock Purchase Agreement at 7.00 per share if the market price for the Common
Stock exceeds 9.00 per share. In addition, on November 2, 2023, White Lion purchased 41,677 shares of the Company s common stock
under the Common Stock Purchase Agreement for which the Company received approximately 64 thousand. The facility is now deemed terminated. 

As
an emerging growth company, we are dependent on outside capital in order to advance our research and development programs, operate our
business, and meet our future obligations as they come due. Our current operating plan indicates that we will incur losses from operations
and generate negative cash flows from operating activities, given anticipated expenditures related to research and development activities
we lack revenue generating ability at this point in our lifecycle. These events and conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern. 

We
will seek additional funding through private equity financings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, marketing, distribution,
or licensing arrangements. There is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining additional financing on terms acceptable to
us, if at all, and we may not be able to enter into collaborations or other arrangements. If we are unable to obtain funding, we could
be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate our research and development programs, which could adversely affect our business prospects and
our ability to continue operations. 

45 

Funding
Requirements 

We
expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the preclinical activities
and clinical trials of our product candidates. In addition, we will incur additional ongoing costs associated with operating as a public
company, including significant legal, accounting, compliance, investor relations and other expenses that we did not incur as a private
company. The timing and amount of our operating expenditures will depend on our ability to: 

advance
 preclinical development of our early-stage programs; 

manufacture,
 or have manufactured on our behalf, our preclinical and clinical drug material and develop processes for late state and commercial
 manufacturing; 

Obtain
 regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; 

establish
 a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize our product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval
 and intend to commercialize on our own; 

hire
 additional clinical, quality control and scientific personnel; 

expand
 our operational, financial and management systems and increase personnel, including personnel to support our research and clinical
 development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts and our operations as a public company; and 

obtain,
 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio. 

We
will require additional capital as we seek regulatory approval of our product candidates and if we choose to pursue in-licenses or acquisitions
of other product candidates. If we receive regulatory approval for our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization
expenses related to product manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution, depending on where we choose to commercialize. Because
of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of biologic product candidates, we
are unable to estimate the exact amount of our working capital needs. 

Backstop
Agreement 

As
discussed above, prior to Closing, on February 12, 2023, AHAC, Legacy Ocean and Vellar entered into an amended and restated OTC Equity
Prepaid Forward Transaction, referred to herein as the Backstop Agreement. Concurrently, on February 13, 2023, AHAC, Vellar and Legacy
Ocean entered into separate assignment and novation agreements (as amended as it relates to Polar on October 2, 2023), whereby Vellar
assigned its rights and obligations to a portion of the shares of Class A common stock subject to the Backstop Agreement to Meteora and
Polar. Further, the Backstop Agreement granted the Backstop Parties the right to purchase Additional Shares from us of up to an amount
equal to the difference between the number of Recycled Shares and the maximum number of shares of 8,000,000. 

On
February 14, 2023, pursuant to the Backstop Agreement, (i) the Backstop Parties purchased 3,535,466 Recycles Shares of AHAC s Class
A common stock for 10.56 per share and (ii) pursuant to Polar s exercise of its right to purchase Additional Shares, AHAC, Legacy
Ocean and Polar entered into a subscription agreement pursuant to which Polar purchased 1,350,000 newly issued shares of our common stock
at a per share purchase price of approximately 10.56 (the Polar Subscription ). Under the Backstop Agreement, the Additional
Shares are subject to the same terms as the Recycled Shares, including with regard to repayment and repurchase. 

We
agreed to purchase those shares from the Backstop Parties on a forward basis upon the Maturity Date (as amended, the third
anniversary of the closing of the Business Combination, subject to certain acceleration provisions). The purchase price payable by us
includes a prepayment in the amount of the redemption price per share (the Prepayment ). 

Subsequent
to Closing, the Prepayment amount was equal to 51.6 million, consisting of 37.3 million for the Recycled Shares and 14.3 million for
the Polar Subscription shares. As the 14.3 million was a netted transaction between us and Polar, only 37.3 million was paid out of
the funds we received from AHAC s trust account. This net impact from the payment outflow to Backstop Parties for the Backstop
Agreement of 51.6 million and the proceeds inflow from the issuance of common stock pursuant to the Backstop Agreement and Polar Subscription
of 14.3 million are reported in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. 

At
any time prior to the Maturity Date, the Backstop Parties may elect an optional early termination to sell some or all of the Recycled
Shares in the open market. If the Backstop Parties sell any shares prior to the Maturity Date, the pro-rata portion of the Prepayment
is due back to us. As of March 31, 2024, the Backstop Parties have sold 143,261 shares, for which we received net proceeds of 1.4 million,
after paying related fees to the Backstop Parties. Depending on the manner in which the OTC Equity Prepaid Forward Transaction is settled,
we may never have access to the full Prepayment. 

46 

On
May 23, 2023 we received an Equity Prepaid Forward Transaction - Valuation Date Notice Notice from Vellar stating that,
due to our alleged failure to timely register the shares held by Vellar, Vellar has the right to terminate the Backstop Agreement as
to their portion of the shares and Vellar is claiming it is entitled to receive Maturity Consideration (as defined in the Backstop Agreement)
equal to 6.7 million, which at our discretion may be paid in cash or by offset to the shares currently held by Vellar. Management takes
issue with multiple aspects of the Notice including, but not limited to, Vellar s right to terminate their portion of the Backstop
Agreement and their asserted Maturity Consideration calculation. As such, we are consulting with advisors and other parties and are considering
the potential resources and remedies we may elect to pursue and intend to assert our rights should this matter not be resolved. After
a review of all applicable documents related to the Backstop Agreement, we believe our position with respect to the terms of the agreement
and intent of the parties is supported by the Backstop Agreement and the facts and circumstances under which it was entered into. Further,
given the early stage of this matter and the uncertainty inherent in litigation and investigations, the Company does not currently believe
it is (i) probable to incur losses or (ii) possible to develop estimates of reasonably possible losses (or a range of possible losses)
for this matter. 

Refer
to Note 3, Business Combination and Backstop Agreement, in our condensed consolidated financial Statements included elsewhere
in this Report for further detail on the Backstop Agreement and Note 4, Fair Value Measurements , for further detail around the
valuation of the Fixed Maturity Consideration and Backstop Put Option Liability. 

Sponsor
Promissory Notes and Ayrton Convertible Note Financing 

Sponsor
Promissory Notes 

Upon
consummation of the Business Consummation, we assumed two of AHAC s loans, totaling 2.1 million, one of which accrued interest
at 8 per annum and the other accrues interest at 15 per annum. Both were due within five days of Closing. 0.5 million was paid down
at Closing, with the remaining paid down in May 2023 via the proceeds received from the initial Note under the Ayrton Convertible Note
Financing, discussed below. 

In
connection with the assumption of AHAC s loans and pursuant to the terms of the Business Combination Agreement described above,
we issued 1,365,000 shares of our common stock to the Sponsor as consideration for providing the loans to us (the Sponsor Extension
Shares ). In addition, pursuant to the terms of an amendment entered into prior to the paydown of the loans, we issued a total
of 200,000 shares of our common stock in exchange for extension of the maturity date of one of the loans. 

We
recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of 1.2 million in our consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended March
31, 2023, for the 200,000 shares issued in exchange for extensions of the maturity date, based on the grant date fair value of the shares
issued. In addition, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of 13.6 million in our condensed consolidated statements of operations
for the three months ended March 31, 2023, for the issuance of the Sponsor Extension Shares, based on the grant date fair value. Further,
we recorded interest expense of 18 thousand million in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended
March 31, 2023. 

Ayrton
Convertible Note Financing 

In
May 2023, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the SPA with an accredited investor (the Investor for the sale of up to three Senior Secured Convertible Notes (each, a Note and collectively, the Notes ),
which Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock, in an aggregate principal amount of up to 27.0 million, in a private placement
(the Ayrton Convertible Note Financing ). 

In
May 2023, we consummated the closing for the sale of (i) the initial Note in the principal amount of 7.6 million and (ii) a warrant
to initially acquire up to 552,141 additional shares of our common stock with an initial exercise price of 11.50 per share of common
stock, subject to adjustment, exercisable immediately and expiring five years from the date of issuance (the SPA Warrant ).
Each Note will be sold at an original issue discount of 8 . Future issuances of Notes Additional Closings are subject
to satisfaction of certain conditions. At the closing of the first Additional Closing, 8.64 million in principal amount of Notes will
be issued and 10.8 million in principal amount of Notes will be issued at the closing of the second Additional Closing. So long as any
Notes remain outstanding, we and each of our subsidiaries are prohibited from effecting or entering into an agreement to affect any subsequent
placement involving a Variable Rate Transaction, as defined within the SPA, other than pursuant to the White Lion Common Stock Purchase
Agreement. 

47 

We
were required to obtain stockholder approval authorizing the issuance of our common stock under the Notes and Warrant in compliance with
the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq (without regard to any limitations on conversion or exercise set forth in the Notes or Warrant,
respectively), including, shares of our common stock to be issued in connection with any Additional Closing. We obtained stockholder
approval of the transaction in August 2023 at a special meeting of stockholders. As a result, there is no limitation under the SPA that
would prohibit us from issuing to the investor shares of common stock in excess of 19.99 of our outstanding shares of common stock as
of the date of the SPA. 

The
interest rate applicable to each Note is, as of any date of determination, the lesser of (i) 8 per annum and (ii) the greater of (x)
5 per annum and (y) the sum of (a) the secured overnight financing rate, which from time to time is published in the Money
Rates column of The Wall Street Journal (Eastern Edition, New York Metro), in effect as of such date of determination and (b)
2 per annum. Each Note will mature on the first anniversary of its issuance. Additionally, each Note is required to be senior to all
of our other indebtedness, other than certain permitted indebtedness. The Notes will be secured by all of our existing and future assets
(including those of our significant subsidiaries). Upon the occurrence of certain events, the Notes will be payable in monthly installments.
A noteholder may, at its election, defer the payment of all or any portion of the installment amount due on any installment date to another
installment payment date. 

All
or any portion of the principal amount of each Note, plus accrued and unpaid interest is convertible at any time, in whole or in part,
at the noteholder s option, into shares of our common stock at an initial fixed conversion price of 10.34 per share, subject to
certain adjustments and alternative conditions. A noteholder will not have the right to convert any portion of a Note, to the extent
that, after giving effect to such conversion, the noteholder (together with certain of its affiliates and other related parties) would
beneficially own in excess of 9.99 of the shares of our common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such conversion.
Upon a change of control, noteholders may require us to redeem all, or any portion, of the Notes at a price stipulated by certain conditions
as discussed within the SPA. 

The
Notes provide for certain events of default, including, among other things, any breach of the covenants described in the SPA and any
failure of Dr. Chirinjeev Kathuria to be the chairman of our Board of Directors. In connection with an event of default, the noteholders
may require us to redeem all or any portion of the Notes, at a premium set forth in the SPA. 

We
are subject to certain customary affirmative and negative covenants regarding the rank of the Notes, the incurrence of indebtedness,
the existence of liens, the repayment of indebtedness and the making of investments, the payment of cash in respect of dividends, distributions
or redemptions, the transfer of assets, the maturity of other indebtedness, and transactions with affiliates, among other customary matters.
We are also subject to financial covenants requiring that (i) the amount of our available cash equal or exceed 3.0 million at the time
of each Additional Closing; (ii) the ratio of (a) the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, accrued and unpaid interest thereon
and accrued and unpaid late charges to (b) our average market capitalization over the prior ten trading days, not exceed 35 ; and (iii)
at any time any Notes remain outstanding, with respect to any given calendar month (each, a Current Calendar Month (x)
the available cash on the last calendar day in such Current Calendar Month shall be greater than or equal to the available cash on the
last calendar day of the month prior to such Current Calendar Month less 1.5 million. 

Short-Term
Loans 

Refer
to Note 6, Short-Term Loans, in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements for additional detail about our short-term
loans and the warrants issued in conjunction with these loans. 

48 

Equity
Financing 

Common
Stock Purchase Agreement 

Following
the Business Combination, we are subject to the terms and conditions of (i) a common stock purchase agreement, dated September 7, 2022,
and as amended on October 4, 2023, (the Common Stock Purchase Agreement and (ii) a registration rights agreement, dated
September 7, 2022 (the White Lion Registration Rights Agreement ), that AHAC entered into with White Lion Capital LLC White
Lion ). Pursuant to the Common Stock Purchase Agreement, we have the right from time to time at its option to sell to White Lion
up to 75.0 million in aggregate gross purchase price of newly issued shares Equity Line Shares of our common stock,
subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the Common Stock Purchase Agreement. These limitations stipulate, among other
things, that we may not sell, and White Lion may not purchase, shares of our common stock that would result in White Lion owning more
than 9.99 of our outstanding common stock. The Common Stock Purchase Agreement expires after two years. 

In
consideration for the commitments of White Lion to purchase Equity Line Shares, the Common Stock Purchase Agreement included issuing
initial commitment shares with a value of 0.8 million based upon the closing sale price two days prior to the filing of the initial
registration statement. 

In
April 2023, the Common Stock Purchase Agreement was amended to fix the number of initial commitment shares at 75,000 shares to White
Lion, which had a fair value of 0.5 million upon issuance. The 0.5 million in commitment costs were recorded in other income/(expense)
in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

Effective
October 4, 2023, the Company and White Lion entered into the first amendment of the Common Stock Purchase Agreement (the Amendment ).
The Amendment is intended to afford the Company greater flexibility and provide the Company an additional alternative to issue a fixed
price Purchase Notice under the Common Stock Purchase Agreement [at 7.00 per share if the market price for the Common
Stock exceeds 9.00 per share]. In addition, on November 2, 2023, White Lion purchased 41,677 shares of the Company s common stock
under the Common Stock Purchase Agreement for which the Company received approximately 64 thousand. The facility is now deemed terminated. 

Any
future proceeds earned from the sale of shares will be used to support funding of our ongoing operations and working capital. 

Other
Commitments 

License
Fees 

Our
contractual obligations are expected to have an effect on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. Under our license agreements
with our academic research institution partners, fixed license maintenance fees of 0.3 million are due within 15 days of financing of
at least 10.0 million and 0.1 million are due within 30 days of financing of at least 10.0 million. In addition, under these license
agreements, we are also required to make payments upon successful completion and achievement of certain milestones as well as royalty
payments upon sales of products covered by such licenses. The payment obligations under the license fees are recorded in accounts payable.
The payment obligations under the collaboration agreements are contingent upon future events such as our achievement of specified development,
clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestones. As the timing of these future milestone payments are not known, we have not included
these fees in our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2024. None of these were paid as of March 31, 2024. 

Refer
to Note 12, License and Manufacturing Agreements , in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements for further detail around
timing of license fees due. 

Contingent
Compensation and Other Contingent Payments 

Under
the management employment agreements, we have salaries and bonuses that are contingently payable upon financing, collectively called
contingent compensation, that are contingently payable based only upon our first cumulative capital raise of at least 50.0 million.
As of March 31, 2024, we have contingent compensation and bonuses in the amount of 14.0 million to certain members of senior management
as well as 1.0 million in contingent vendor payments. These amounts will not be paid if the contingencies do not occur. Since the payment
of obligations under the employment agreements are contingent upon these future events, which are not considered probable as such future
events are deemed outside of our control, we have not included these amounts in our condensed consolidated financial statements. None
of these were paid as of March 31, 2024. 

49 

Development
and Manufacturing Services Agreement 

We
have entered and anticipate we will continue to enter into contracts in the normal course of business with external organizations such
as CMOs, CROs and other third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates and to support clinical trials and preclinical research
studies and testing. We expect that these contracts will be generally cancelable by us, and we anticipate that payments due upon cancellation
will consist only of payments for services provided or expenses incurred, including noncancelable obligations of our service providers,
up to the date of cancellation. 

Cash
Flows 

To
date, we have not generated any revenue. Cash flows to date have resulted from financing activities, including payments made on behalf
of the Company by related parties and net proceeds from issuance of shares of common stock consisting of friends and family of our employees
and short-term borrowings, including the initial Note from the Ayrton Convertible Note Financing. As of March 31, 2024, our unrestricted
cash balance of approximately 19 thousand is held in a standard checking account and our restricted cash balance of 0.5 million is
held in an escrow account. We do not have any cash equivalents. Cash used in operating activities was primarily used to pay legal and
accounting fees. Our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses of 16.9 million as of March 31, 2024, will be paid off utilizing
future proceeds from current and future financings, including proceeds from the Common Stock Purchase Agreement and future debt and equity
financings. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

Our
consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America,
or GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends
and events, and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our
estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, 
to our condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Report, we believe that the following accounting policies
are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 

50 

Valuation
Methodologies 

Valuation
of Backstop Put Option Liability and Fixed Maturity Consideration 

We
utilized a Monte-Carlo simulation to value the Backstop Put Option Liability and Fixed Maturity Consideration. The key inputs and assumptions
used in the Monte-Carlo Simulation, including volatility, expected term, expected future stock price, and various simulated paths, were
utilized to estimate the fair value of the associated derivative liabilities. The value of the Backstop Put Option Liability and Fixed
Maturity were calculated as the average present value over 50,000 simulated paths. We measure the fair value at each reporting period,
with subsequent fair values to be recorded within other income/(expense) in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

Valuation
of 2023 Convertible Note and SPA Warrant 

We
utilized a Monte-Carlo simulation at inception to value the 2023 Convertible Note and SPA Warrant. The Monte-Carlo simulation is
calculated as the average present value over all simulated paths. The key inputs and assumptions used in the Monte-Carlo Simulation,
including volatility, estimated market yield, the probability of various scenarios, including subsequent placement and change in
control, and various simulated paths, were utilized to estimate the fair value of the associated liabilities. We will continue to
measure the fair value at each reporting period, with subsequent fair values to be recorded within other income (expense) in our
condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

Valuation
of the Ayrton Note Purchase Option 

We
utilized the Black-Scholes Merton model to value the Ayrton Note Purchase Option. The key inputs and assumptions used in the
Black-Scholes Merton model, including volatility and risk-free rate, were utilized to estimate the fair value of the associated
liability. We will continue to measure the fair value at each reporting period, with subsequent fair values to be recorded within
other income (expense) in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

Fair
Values Accounting for Equity-Classified Warrants and Stock-Based Awards 

We
measure and record the expense related to warrants and stock-based awards based upon the fair value at the date of grant. We estimate
the grant date fair value of each common stock option using the Black-Scholes Merton model, which requires the input of highly subjective
assumptions and management s best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and management s judgement. If
factors change and different assumptions are used, our expense recognition could be materially different in the future. 

Prior
to September 2022, the value of the warrants issued was estimated considering, among other things, contemporaneous valuations for Legacy
Ocean s common stock prepared by unrelated third-party valuation firms and prices set forth in our previous filings with the SEC
for a proposed IPO of our common stock that was not pursued by us Legacy Ocean IPO filings ). We used the mid-range price
per share based upon our Legacy Ocean IPO filings. Starting in September 2022, following the execution of the Business Combination Agreement
with AHAC, the value of the warrants was based on the closing price of AHAC s Class A common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global
Select Market on the grant date. 

51 

Following
the Closing of the Business Combination, the value of warrants and stock options issued by us was based on the closing price of our
common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Capital Market on the grant date. As noted above, we estimate the fair value, based upon
these values, using the Black-Scholes Merton model, which is affected principally by the life of the warrant, the volatility of the
underlying shares, the risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends. Expected volatility is based on the historical share
volatility of a set of comparable publicly traded companies over a period of time equal to the expected term of the warrants. The
risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the warrant
for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the warrant. Expected dividend yield is zero based on the fact that we
have never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We expense the amount for
warrants and stock-based awards within other income (expense) and stock-based compensation, respectively, in our condensed
consolidated statements of operations. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

In
August 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update ASU No. 2020-06, Debt Debt with Conversion and
Other Options (Subtopic 470-20 and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) 
Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity , which simplifies the accounting for
convertible instruments, amends the guidance on derivative scope exceptions for contracts in an entity s own equity, and
modifies the guidance on diluted earnings per share calculations as a result of these changes. The Company early adopted ASU No.
2020-06 as of January 1, 2023, using a modified retrospective approach, noting the Company s prior instruments would not be
impacted by this adoption. The Company utilized the updated derivative guidance when accounting for the 2023 Convertible Note (as
defined in Note 7, Senior Secured Convertible Notes ). 

In
November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ASU
2023-07 ). ASU 2023-07 expands public entities segment disclosures by requiring disclosure of significant segment
expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment
profit or loss, an amount and description of its composition for other segment items, and interim disclosures of a reportable
segment s profit or loss and assets. All disclosure requirements under ASU 2023-07 are also required for public entities with
a single reportable segment. ASU 2023-07 is effective for public business entities with fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of
adopting ASU 2023-07 on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In
December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures to enhance the
transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. This standard is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2024 and can be applied on a prospective or retrospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that
the adoption of this ASU may have on its consolidated financial statements.

Emerging
Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status 

The
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 permits an emerging growth company such as us to take advantage of an extended
transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies until those standards would otherwise
apply to private companies. We have elected to not opt out of this provision and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised
accounting standards at the time private companies adopt the new or revised accounting standard and will do so until such time that we
either (i) irrevocably elect to opt out of such extended transition period or (ii) no longer qualify as an emerging growth
company. 

We
are also a smaller reporting company meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is expected to be
less than 700 million and our annual revenue was less than 100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue
to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250 million or (ii)
our annual revenue was less than 100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by
non-affiliates is less than 700 million. If we are a smaller reporting company at the time that we cease to be an emerging growth company,
we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically,
as a smaller reporting company, we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations
regarding executive compensation. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

As
a smaller reporting company (as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act), we are not required to provide disclosure under this Item
3. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer (our
principal executive officer and principal accounting/financial officer), we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the
end of the period covered by this Report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on this evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of March 31, 2024, the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective at a reasonable assurance level. 

In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes
that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must
reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of
possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 

Notwithstanding
the conclusion by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer that our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31,
2024 were not effective, and notwithstanding the identified material weakness, management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, believes the financial statements included in this Report fairly represent in all material respects our financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows at and for the periods presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Previously
Identified Material Weakness 

In
connection with our preparation and the audits of our financial statements as of December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we identified a material
weakness as defined under the Exchange Act, and by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) in our internal control
over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,
such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. Specifically, our material weakness is that our management does not have adequate staffing in its accounting
department and has not yet designed and implemented the appropriate processes and internal controls to support accurate and timely financial
reporting. Management is working to implement remediation steps to improve our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control
over financial reporting, including hiring of additional accounting personnel, such as Jolie Kahn as our Chief Financial Officer, and
engaging consultants to assist management. Additionally, management plans to further develop and implement formal policies, processes
and documentation procedures relating to financial reporting. 

Management s
Plan to Remediate the Material Weaknesses 

We
have begun taking measures, and plan to continue to take measures, to remediate the material weakness. These measures include hiring
or engaging additional accounting personnel with familiarity with reporting under U.S. GAAP, including hiring of Jolie Kahn as our Chief
Financial Officer, engaging consultants to assist management, and implementing and adopting additional controls and formal policies,
processes and documentation procedures relating to financial reporting. We plan to undertake recruitment efforts to identify additional
accounting personnel, including possible use of third-party service providers. Remediation costs consist primarily of additional personnel
expenses. We may identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls,
which may impair our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis. 

However,
the implementation of these measures may not be sufficient to remediate the control deficiencies that may lead to a material weakness
in our internal control over financial reporting or to prevent or avoid potential future material weaknesses. Moreover, our current controls
and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate in the future because of changes in conditions in our business. Furthermore,
we may not have identified all material weaknesses and weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting
may be discovered in the future. If we are unable to successfully remediate our existing or any future material weaknesses in our internal
control over financial reporting, or if we identify any additional material weaknesses, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting
may be adversely affected, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic
reports in addition to applicable stock exchange listing requirements, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting, and
our share price may decline as a result. 

We
also could become subject to investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities. Any failure to develop or maintain effective
controls or any difficulties encountered in its implementation or improvement could negatively impact our operating results or cause
us to fail to meet its reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods, which could
cause the price of our common stock and warrants to decline. 

For
more information concerning the material weakness identified and remediation steps, see the section titled Risk Factors 
 We identified a material weakness in Legacy Ocean s internal control over financial reporting. If our remediation of
this material weakness is not effective, or if we experience additional material weaknesses or otherwise fail to maintain an effective
system of internal controls in the future, we may not be able to accurately report our financial condition or results of operations 
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed on November 25, 2024. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended March 31, 2024, that materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II-OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

From
time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. As of the date of this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, we were not a party to any material legal matters or claims except as set forth in our audited financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2023, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December, 31, 2023. 

In
the future, we may become party to legal matters and claims in the ordinary course of business, the resolution of which we do not anticipate
would have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows except as set forth in our audited
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December, 31, 2023. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

In
addition to those the risk factors set forth in Part I Item 1A: Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2023, and other reports we filed with the SEC, below are certain risk factors related to the Company and its
operations. 

Our
level of indebtedness and significant debt service obligations could adversely affect our financial condition or our ability to fulfill
our obligations, including the note issued in May 2023, and make it more difficult for us to fund our operations. 

As
of March 31, 2024, we had 12.6 million in principal of indebtedness outstanding, including 7.6 million in principal amount of a convertible
promissory note issued in May 2023. We have very limited cash resources from which to repay any obligations that a lender requires to
be paid in cash. Our level of indebtedness could have important negative consequences to you and us, including: 

we
 may have difficulty satisfying our obligations with respect to our outstanding notes and debt obligations; 

we
 may have difficulty obtaining financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes; 

we
 will need to use a substantial portion of our available cash flow to pay interest and principal on our debt (including our currently
 outstanding notes and the additional notes offered hereby), which will reduce the amount of money available to finance our operations
 and other business activities; 

our
 debt level increases our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse industry conditions; 

our
 debt level could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in our industry in general; 

certain
 of our debt obligations are secured by Company assets, and upon a default, of which there are several in existence as a result of
 the restatements discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and failure to timely file this Form 10-Q, a lender may be able to seek to
 seize, control or otherwise monetize those assets to satisfy our debt obligations; 

our
 leverage could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and 

our
 failure to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt instruments which, among other things, may require
 us to maintain specified financial ratios and will limit our ability to incur debt and sell assets, could result in an event of default
 that, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects. 

Our
ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flows or obtain
external financing in the future. And, in certain cases our debt obligations may be satisfied by way of a conversion into our common
stock, and therefore, our ability to satisfy certain debt obligations is dependent, in part, on the performance of our common stock.
In each case, to some extent this is subject to market, economic, financial, competitive, legislative, and regulatory factors as well
as other factors that are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or
that additional capital will be available to us, in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund
other liquidity needs. Additionally, events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy applicable draw-down
conditions and utilize additional funds under the securities purchase agreement entered into in May 2023. If we are unable to generate
sufficient cash flows, or the value of our common stock is insufficient to facilitate conversions of debt obligations as may be necessary
to service our debt payment obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments,
or seek to raise additional capital. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may be unable to meet our debt
payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 

55 

Despite
our existing level of indebtedness, we may incur more indebtedness. This could further exacerbate the risks described above, including
our ability to service our existing indebtedness. 

We
may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although certain of our debt arrangements contain restrictions
on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, such restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and under certain
circumstances indebtedness incurred in compliance with such restrictions could be substantial. To the extent new debt is added to our
current debt levels, the risks described above would increase. 

To
service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our
control. 

Our
ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including our outstanding notes, and to fund intended research and development
efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial,
competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business when or if
our operations will ultimately generate sufficient cash flow from operations, that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements
will be realized on schedule or that future borrowings or another source of liquidity will be available to us u in an amount sufficient
to enable us to pay our obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to
fund our debt service obligations, or we are unable to identify and execute on another source of outside liquidity, we may be forced
to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, attempt to obtain additional equity capital or refinance
all or a portion of our indebtedness, including the 2023 Convertible Note, on or before maturity. In the absence of such operating results
and resources, we could face substantial cash flow problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to meet our debt
service and other obligations. We cannot assure you as to the timing of such asset sales or the proceeds which we could realize from
such sales and we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including amounts owed under the securities
purchase agreement entered into in May 2023, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. 

Because
there are outstanding notes, obligations and warrants convertible into a significant number of shares of our common stock, holders of
our common stock could be subject to significant dilution. 

We
have funded various of our operations through convertible debt obligations. From time to time we have also issued a number of shares
and warrants to acquire services and assets from third parties. To the extent that our debt obligations are satisfied by way of conversions,
and we issue additional shares of our common stock to satisfy obligations or in consideration for assets or services these issuances
would have a dilutive effect on our existing stockholders. 

Because
of alternate conversion price notices from our principal noteholder, there may be significant dilution. 

Between
March 4, 2024, and March 8, 2024, our principal noteholder sent Alternate Conversion Notices to the Company to convert the principal
value and accrued and unpaid interest under its Note with the Company into shares of Company common stock pursuant to the Alternate Conversion
Price mechanism in the Note. The Company is currently evaluating the situation and working with the noteholder to arrive at an equitable
resolution. If not resolved, an issuance of shares could result in significant dilution.
