The Exchange Ratio will be calculated such that the total number of shares of Akari ADSs to be issued as merger consideration for the Company s Common Stock will be expected to be, upon issuance, approximately of the outstanding shares of Akari ADSs (provided, certain adjustments to this ratio will be made in respect of the net cash, as determined in accordance with the Merger Agreement, of each of Peak Bio and Akari at the close of business one business day prior to the anticipated consummation of the Merger). At the Effective Time, each warrant and option to purchase capital stock of the Company outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be exchanged for a warrant or option to purchase a number of Akari ordinary shares or Akari ADSs, as determined by Akari, based on the Exchange Ratio. Either the Company or Akari may terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, including if (i) the Merger is not completed by December 2, 2024, (ii) the other party's board of directors withdraws, modifies or qualifies its recommendation in favor of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or approves or recommends an alternative transaction or (iii) Akari s or the Company s board of directors, as applicable, resolves to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior proposal prior to obtaining approval of the Akari ADS issuance or Merger, as applicable, from Akari s shareholders or Company s stockholders, as applicable. The Merger Agreement also provides that under certain specified circumstances of termination described in the Merger Agreement, Akari or the Company, as applicable, will be required to pay a termination fee equal to and reimburse the other party for expenses related to the transaction up to million.

million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company expects to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as it continues its efforts to identify product candidates and seek regulatory approvals within its portfolio. The Company will need additional financing to fund its ongoing activities and to close the Merger with Akari. The Company may raise this additional funding through the sale of equity, debt financing or other capital sources, including potential collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions and funding under government contracts. The Company may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into other arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. There can be no assurances that other sources of financing will be available. Due to these uncertainties, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of the uncertainties discussed above. On January 6, 2023, the Company received a determination letter (the Determination Letter from the Panel to delist the Company s common stock and warrants from Nasdaq.

As a result, diluted (loss) income per share is the same as basic (loss) income per share for the periods presented.

per share based on several factors, including an August 1, 2024 409A valuation by an independent third party (the August Valuation ). For the August Valuation, the Company used a probability-weighted expected return method, which is a scenario-based methodology that estimates the fair value of common stock based upon an analysis of future values for the company, assuming various outcomes. The future value of the common stock under each outcome is discounted back to the valuation date at an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate and probability weighted to arrive at an indication of value for the common stock. The Company believed this model was most appropriate given the terms and conditions of the most recent financing. The August Valuation included material estimates and assumptions.

The Company also made estimates on the final Exchange Ratio and the underlying adjustments to this ratio that would be made in respect to net cash, the forecasted fully diluted capital of the Company taking into consideration certain convertible notes and related party debt. The August Valuation also accounted for a discount for lack of marketability that was then applied to the common stock to account for the lack of access to an active public market. The August Valuation concluded that the Common Stock value was . The Company accounted for the option grant under ASC 718 as equity-based compensation based on a performance condition. As the performance condition related to the filing of the Form S-8 was deemed not probable both at grant date and September 30, 2024, no expense was recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to this equity based compensation. As of September 30, 2024, there was an unrecognized compensation cost of related to these unvested issued and outstanding stock options. In February 2023, the Company extended the term of vested options to allow the exercise of these options for an additional one year period. As a result, the Company recorded an expense of included in general and administrative expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 if, and only if, there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the shares of common stock underlying such warrants. 

 If the Company calls the warrants for redemption as described above, the Company s management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise warrants to do so on a cashless basis. In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of shares of common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of common stock underlying the 

 23 

Private Placement Warrants from Ignyte Acquisition Corporation. Each Private Placement Warrant will entitle the holder to purchase one share of common stock at a price of per share, subject to adjustment. The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants, except that the Private Placement Warrants were non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. The Private Placement Warrants were accounted for under ASC 815, pursuant to which the Private Placement Warrants do not meet the criteria for equity classification and must be recorded as liabilities. The Private Placement Warrants were valued using the Black Scholes Option Pricing Model, which is considered to be a Level 3 fair value measurement, as there was no observable market for the Private Placement Warrants and was determined based on significant inputs not observable in the market.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 You should read the following discussion and analysis of Peak Bio s financial condition and results of operations together with Peak Bio s unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Certain of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including information with respect to plans and strategy for Peak Bio s business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the section entitled Risk Factors of this Quarterly Report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, Peak Bio s actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. You should carefully read the section entitled Risk Factors to gain an understanding of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from Peak Bio s forward-looking statements. Please also see the section entitled Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. 
 Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, references in this Peak Bio s Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section to Peak Bio, we, us, our and other similar terms refer to Peak Bio Co., Ltd prior to the Ignyte Business Combination and to Peak Bio, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries after giving effect to the Business Combination. 
 Overview 
 Peak Bio is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapeutics addressing significant unmet need in the areas of oncology, inflammation and rare diseases. Our management team has a combined 50 years of industry experience in the areas of small molecules, antibodies, and antibody-drug-conjugates (ADC). 
 With our current strategic focus, we have leveraged two decades of industry learning in the antibody-drug-conjugate (ADC) field to develop a platform of proprietary technologies that enable us to design ADCs to have improved efficacy, safety, and tolerability relative to existing antibody or ADC therapies. Our most advanced platform, PH-1 or Thailanstatin is being used to generate a pipeline of proprietary ADC product candidates to address patient populations with improved efficacy relative to traditional ADC-based therapies. Our second product candidate is an ADC targeting Trop2, an antigen broadly expressed in solid tumors. We expect our Trop2 ADC to enter clinical development by late 2024. Our Trop2 ADC and other undisclosed discovery-stage product candidates are based on our proprietary PH-1 platform of toxin payloads targeting RNA splicing. 
 Despite commercial success of the ADCs currently on the market, there continues to be a need for ADCs that not only deliver antibody-directed payloads selectively to their tumors, but to also release them safely via improved linker technology and avoid off- target toxicities. Secondly, we believe that adding an immunomodulatory effect to our toxin(s) that engages our immune systems to assist in the cancer killing would contribute to improved tumor killing. 
 Our lead product candidate for which we are seeking a strategic partner for, PHP-303 is a small molecule, 5th generation Phase 2 clinical-ready neutrophil elastase (NE) inhibitor (NEI). We are planning a Phase 2 clinical study in Alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency (AATD) patients. We have completed two Phase 1 trials of PHP-303 in healthy volunteers testing higher doses of PHP-303 by single-ascending dose (SAD) and multiple-ascending dose (MAD). PHP-303 demonstrated dose- dependent pharmacokinetics and the recommended Phase 2 dose was achieved in these trials. A maximum tolerated dose for PHP-303 was not achieved in these Phase 1 trials. 
 We do not have any products available for commercial sale, and we have not generated any product revenue from our portfolio of product candidates. Our ability to generate revenue sufficient to achieve profitability, if ever, will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of our potential therapies, which we expect, if it ever occurs, will take a number of years. The research and development efforts require significant amounts of additional capital and adequate personnel infrastructure. There can be no assurance that our research and development activities will be successfully completed, or that our potential therapies will be commercially viable. 
 We have incurred significant losses since the commencement of our operations. Our net loss was 2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 12.8 million and 13.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue our efforts to identify product candidates and seek regulatory approvals within our portfolio.

We will need additional financing to fund our ongoing activities and to close the Merger with Akari (defined below). We may raise this additional funding through the sale of equity, debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions and funding under government contracts. 
 We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into other arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. There can be no assurances that other sources of financing will be available. Due to these uncertainties, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of the uncertainties discussed above. 
 Recent Developments 
 Akari Merger 
 On March 4, 2024, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement with Akari Therapeutics, Plc, a public company limited by shares incorporated in England and Wales Akari ), and Pegasus Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Akari Merger Sub ), pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Peak Bio (the Merger ), with Peak Bio surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Akari. 
 Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, at the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time ), each issued and outstanding share of Common Stock (other than (x) shares of Common Stock held by us as treasury stock, or shares of Common Stock owned by Akari, Merger Sub or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Akari and (y) Dissenting Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement)), will be converted into the right to receive Akari American Depositary Shares Akari ADSs representing a number of Akari ordinary shares, par value 0.0001 per share (the Akari Ordinary Shares ), equal to an exchange ratio calculated in accordance with the Merger Agreement (the Exchange Ratio ), each such share duly and validly issued against the deposit of the requisite number of Akari Ordinary Shares in accordance with the Deposit Agreement (as defined in the Merger Agreement). The Exchange Ratio will be calculated such that the total number of shares of Akari ADSs to be issued as merger consideration for the Peak Common Stock will be expected to be, upon issuance, approximately 50 of the outstanding shares of Akari ADSs (provided, certain adjustments to this ratio will be made in respect of the net cash, as determined in accordance with the Merger Agreement, of each of Peak Bio and Akari at the close of business one business day prior to the anticipated consummation of the Merger). The Merger Agreement provides that, under certain circumstances, additional Akari ADSs may be issued to the holders of shares of Peak Common Stock following the consummation of the Merger equal to an exchange ratio calculated in accordance with the Merger Agreement (the Additional Exchange Ratio ). 
 At the Effective Time, each warrant to purchase capital stock of Peak Bio Peak Warrant outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into and exchangeable for warrants to purchase a number of Akari Ordinary Shares or Akari ADSs, as determined by Akari (each, an Adjusted Warrant ), on substantially similar terms and subject to substantially similar conditions as were applicable to such Peak Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time, except (i) for terms rendered inoperative by reason of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (ii) as provided in the following sentence and (iii) such amendments to the terms of the Adjusted Warrants as are necessary to comply with applicable Law (as defined in the Merger Agreement). The number of Akari Ordinary Shares (or the number of Akari Ordinary Shares underlying Akari ADSs, as applicable) subject to each Adjusted Warrant will be equal to the number of shares of Peak Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Peak Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, with any fractional Akari Ordinary Shares or Akari ADSs rounded down to the nearest whole Akari Ordinary Share or Akari ADS, as applicable, and the exercise price with respect to each Akari Ordinary Share (or each Akari Ordinary Share underlying Akari ADSs, as applicable) underlying such Adjusted Warrant will be equal to the exercise price of such Peak Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio. The grant of the Adjusted Warrants will be effected as of the Effective Time, or as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable, taking into account Parent s administrative procedures. The Adjusted Warrants will be further adjusted, if applicable, to give effect to the impact of the Additional Exchange Ratio. 
 31 

Each option to acquire shares of Peak Common Stock Peak Option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested, will be assumed and converted into an option to purchase a number of Akari ordinary shares or Akari ADSs, as determined by Akari (each, an Adjusted Option ). The number of Akari Ordinary Shares (or the number of Akari Ordinary Shares underlying Akari ADSs, as applicable) subject to the Adjusted Option will be equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Peak Common Stock subject to such Peak Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, with any fractional Akari Ordinary Shares or Akari ADSs rounded down to the nearest whole Akari Ordinary Share or Akari ADS, as applicable, and the exercise price per share of each Adjusted Option will be equal to the exercise price of such Peak Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio. The Adjusted Options will be further adjusted, if applicable, to give effect to the impact of the Additional Exchange Ratio. 
 Either the Company or Akari may terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, including if (i) the Merger is not completed by December 2, 2024, (ii) the other party's board of directors withdraws, modifies or qualifies its recommendation in favor of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or approves or recommends an alternative transaction or (iii) Akari s or the Company s board of directors, as applicable, resolves to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior proposal prior to obtaining approval of the Akari ADS issuance or Merger, as applicable, from Akari s shareholders or Company s stockholders, as applicable. The Merger Agreement also provides that under certain specified circumstances of termination described in the Merger Agreement, Akari or the Company, as applicable, will be required to pay a termination fee equal to 300,000 and reimburse the other party for expenses related to the transaction up to 1.5 million. 
 
 Voting Agreements 
 Concurrently with the Merger Agreement, we and Akari entered into voting and support agreements (the Voting Agreements with certain stockholders of Peak Bio (the Peak Stockholders and certain shareholders of Akari (the Akari Shareholders and, together with the Peak Stockholders, the Supporting Holders ). The Supporting Holders have agreed to, among other things, vote their shares in favor of the Merger Agreement and the Merger or the issuance of Akari Ordinary Shares in connection therewith, as applicable, in accordance with the recommendation of the respective boards of directors of Peak Bio and Akari. 
 
 Bylaws Amendment 
 In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, on March 3, 2024, our Board approved an amendment to our Amended and Restated Bylaws (the Bylaws Amendment ), which became effective immediately. The Bylaws Amendment requires that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, employee or stockholder (including a beneficial owner) of the Company to the Company or the Company s stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against any director, officer, employee or stockholder (including a beneficial owner) of the Company arising under any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law DGCL or the bylaws or the certificate of incorporation of the Company, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or if the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware does not have jurisdiction, a state court located within the State of Delaware or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has subject matter jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware).

 We will have the right to terminate the White Lion Purchase Agreement at any time after commencement, at no cost or penalty, upon three (3) Trading Days prior written notice. Additionally, White Lion will have the right to 
 34 

terminate the White Lion Purchase Agreement upon three (3) days prior written notice to us if (i) there is a Fundamental Transaction (as defined in the White Lion Purchase Agreement), (ii) we are in breach or default in any material respect of the White Lion RRA, (iii) there is a lapse of the effectiveness, or unavailability of, the registration statement for a period of 45 consecutive Trading Days or for more than an aggregate of 90 Trading Days in any 365-day period, (iv) the suspension of trading of the Common Stock for a period of five (5) consecutive Trading Days, (v) the material breach of the White Lion Purchase Agreement by us, which breach is not cured within the applicable cure period or (vi) a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the White Lion Purchase Agreement) has occurred and is continuing. No termination of the White Lion Purchase Agreement will affect the registration rights provisions contained in the White Lion RRA. 
 In consideration for the commitments of White Lion, as described above, we have agreed that it will issue to White Lion shares of Common Stock having a value of 250,000 based upon the Closing Sale Price (as defined in the White Lion Purchase Agreement) of Common Stock two Trading Days prior to the filing of the Initial Registration Statement as Initial Commitment Shares. We may increase the number of shares it may sell to White Lion by issuing additional Commitment Shares in two additional tranches of 250,000 each. We issued Initial Commitment Shares of 50,200 shares of Common Stock to White Lion, based upon the Closing Sale Price of our Common Stock of 4.98 per share on November 30, 2022. 
 Concurrently with the execution of the White Lion Purchase Agreement, we entered into the White Lion RRA with White Lion in which we have agreed to register the shares of Common Stock purchased by White Lion with the SEC for resale within 30 days of the consummation of a business combination. The White Lion RRA also contains usual and customary damages provisions for failure to file and failure to have the registration statement declared effective by the SEC within the time periods specified. 
 The White Lion Purchase Agreement and the White Lion RRA contain customary representations, warranties, conditions and indemnification obligations of the parties. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in such agreements were made only for purposes of such agreements and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreements and may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties. 
 In March 2023, we entered into an amendment to the White Lion Purchase Agreement to give us the right, but not the obligation to require White Lion to purchase shares of our common stock while trading on the OTC Market. Under the terms of the amendment, we will issue to White Lion within five (5) Trading Days following the effective date of the amendment fully paid, non-assessable shares of our Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) 250,000 and (ii) the lowest traded sale price of the common stock of the 10 (ten) Trading Days prior to the effective date of the amendment, minus 50,200. In March 2023, as compensation for its commitment to enter into the amendment, we issued 412,763 shares of our common stock to White Lion. 
 In August 2023, we and White Lion entered into a second amendment to the Common Stock Purchase Agreement (the Second Amendment ). The Second Amendment includes, among other things, the right of the Company to issue a Purchase Notice (defined in the Second Amendment as an Accelerated Purchase Notice requesting White Lion to purchase newly issued shares of common stock from us, subject to acceptance by White Lion, with pricing of the shares to be sold by us to White Lion under such Accelerated Purchase Notice determined on the date of issuance by us of the Accelerate Purchase Notice and acceptance by White Lion (the date of such notice defined as the Accelerated Valuation Period ). Such accelerated purchases pursuant to an Accelerated Purchase Notice will be sold to White Lion at a price, defined as an Accelerated Purchase Price, equal to the lower of (i) the opening price of common stock during the Accelerated Valuation Period, (ii) the closing price of the common stock during Accelerated Valuation Period, or (iii) the volume weighted average price of the common stock during Accelerated Valuation Period; provided, however, that if at the time we deliver an Accelerated Purchase Notice to Investor the price of the common stock is lower than the opening price of the common stock during the Accelerated Valuation Period, the Accelerated Purchase Price will be discounted by 20 . In addition, the Second Amendment provides for an Accelerated Purchase Notice Limit equal to 200 . 
 In addition, in the event we do not issue Purchase Notices (as defined in the White Lion Purchase Agreement) to White Lion providing for the purchase of at least 1,250,000 of Purchase Shares (as defined in the White Lion Purchase Agreement and Second Amendment) in the aggregate within 180 days following the effective date of the amendment, we will issue to White Lion an additional number of fully paid, non-assessable shares of common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) 150,000 and (ii) the lowest Closing Sale Price (as defined in the White Lion Purchase Agreement and Second Amendment) of common stock of the 10 (ten) Trading Days prior to the 180th day following the effective date of the amendment.

 Components of Results of Operations

 Revenue 
 Our revenue has historically been generated through grants from government organizations. We currently have no commercially approved products. Grant revenue is recognized during the period that the research and development services occur, as qualifying expenses are incurred or conditions of the grants are met. Qualifying expenses are recognized when incurred as research and development expenses. Expenses for grants are tracked by using a project code specific to the grant, and the employees also track hours worked by using the project code. 
 Grant Revenue 
 Our grant revenues are derived from research programs with the Department of Defense, US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity for work on a COVID-19 therapeutic. 
 Grants awarded to us for research and development by government entities are outside the scope of the contracts with customers and contributions guidance. This is because these granting entities are not considered to be customers and are not receiving reciprocal value for their grant support provided to us. These grants provide us with payments for certain types of expenditures in return for research and development activities over a contractually defined period. 
 We recognize grant revenue based on the reimbursable costs that are incurred during the period, up to pre-approved award limits. The expenses associated with these reimbursements are reflected as a component of research and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
 Research and Development Expense 
 We expense research and development costs as incurred. Research and development expense consist primarily of costs related to personnel, including salaries and other personnel related expenses, contract manufacturing and supply, consulting fees, and the cost of facilities and support services used in drug development. Assets acquired that are used for research and development and have no future alternative use are expensed as in-process research and development. 
 36 

General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits, including stock-based compensation, related to our executive, finance, business development, legal, human resources and support functions. Other general and administrative expenses include professional fees for auditing, tax, consulting and patent-related services, rent and utilities and insurance.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Since our inception, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations. Our net loss was 2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 12.8 million and 13.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. At September 30, 2024 we had cash of 0.9 million. 
 Since the beginning of 2024, we raised aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 0.7 million from the issuance of December 2023 Convertible Notes, 0.75 million from the issuance of Secured Founder Loan and 3.5 million from the issuance of May 2024 Convertible Notes. 
 Funding Requirements 
 We expect to incur losses from operations for the foreseeable future primarily due to research and development expenses, including expenses related to conducting research activities, pre-clinical expenses and clinical trials. Our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors, including: 
 the scope, progress, results and costs of our clinical trials, including but not limited to PHP-303 and our PH-1 ADC Platform; 

the cost of manufacturing drug supply for our clinical and preclinical studies; 

the future results of on-going preclinical research and subsequent clinical trials for treatments for oncology, genetic disease, liver disease, inflammation, and other pipeline candidates we may identify from time to time, including our ability to obtain regulatory approvals; 

any changes in regulatory standards relating to the review of our product candidates; and our ability to timely obtain such required regulatory approvals; 

the number and development requirements of other product candidates that we pursue; 

the emergence of competing technologies and other adverse market developments; 

our ability, and the ability of our third-party manufacturers, to manufacture or supply sufficient quantities of clinical products; 

the costs of future commercialization activities, if any, including establishing sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; 

39 

our ability to achieve the degree of market acceptance necessary for future commercial success of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval, if any; 

the costs of preparing, filing, and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing, and defending intellectual property-related claims; 

the impact of litigation that may be brought against us or of litigation that we may pursue against others; 

the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products, and technologies; 

our ability to successfully integrate acquired products and technologies into our business, including the possibility that the expected benefits of the transactions will not be fully realized by us or may take longer to realize than expected; 

our ability to establish and maintain collaborations, partnerships or other similar arrangements and to obtain or satisfy any milestone, royalty, or other payments from any such collaborations; 

the extent to which our business could be adversely impacted by the effects of COVID-19 outbreak, including due to actions by us, governments, suppliers or other third parties to control the spread of COVID-19, or by other health epidemics or pandemics; and 

the costs of operating as a public company. 

We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue our efforts to identify product candidates and seek regulatory approvals within our gene therapy portfolio. 
 Additional financing will be needed to fund our ongoing activities. We may raise this additional funding through the sale of equity, debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions and funding under government contracts. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements or arrangement when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate certain of our research and development programs. There can be no assurances that other sources of financing would be available. Due to these uncertainties, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 Our future operations are highly dependent on a combination of factors, including (i) the timely and successful completion of additional financing; (ii) the success of our research and development programs; (iii) the development of competitive therapies by other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, (iv) our ability to attract and retain key employees, (v) our ability to manage growth of the organization; (vi) our ability to protect our proprietary technology; and ultimately (vii) regulatory approval and market acceptance of our product candidates.

(761,444) 

Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 0.3 million more than net cash used for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Although the operating expenses decreased by 7.1 million in 2024 as compared to 2023, this decrease was offset by the increase in accounts payable and accruals due to the timing of the cash outlays. The decrease in the operating expenses is due to the reduction in facilities expenses, reduction in headcount of general and administrative employees, and decreases in direct project expenses related to the PHP-303 program, the PH-1 ADC Platform, and other general and pre-clinical programs as a result of delays in our ongoing and planned research activities. 
 Investing Activities 
 40 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold research equipment for gross proceeds of 66,500. There was no net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Financing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 net cash provided by financing activities was driven by the net proceeds from additional closes of the December 2023 Convertible Notes in the amount of 0.7 million, proceeds from the close of the May 2024 Convertible Notes in the amount of 3.3 million and proceeds from a related party loan of 0.8 million, partially offset by repayment of the Insurance Financing Payable of 0.6 million. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 net cash provided by financing activities was driven by the net proceeds from issuance of April 2023 convertible notes payable of 2.1 million, proceeds from exercise of warrants of 1 million and proceeds from a related party loan of 0.3 million, and proceeds from the issuance of common shares under the White Lion Purchase Agreement, partially offset by repayment of the insurance financing of 0.9 million. 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 In October 2021, we entered into a lease for laboratory and office facilities in Palo Alto, California that expires in March 2027 with a five-year renewal option and opened a secured letter of credit with a third-party financial institution in lieu of a security deposit for 177,000.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 
 The preparation of our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and operating results require our management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. 
 Our significant accounting policies and estimates are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on August 5, 2024, which describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as from the date upon which we filed our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 with the SEC. 
 Recently Adopted Accounting Standards 
 In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting: Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. This ASU modified the disclosure and presentation requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures of significant segment expenses and clarified that single reportable segment entities must apply Topic 280 in its entirety. This guidance is effective for the Company for the year beginning January 1, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statement. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 on January 1, 2024 and the adoption did not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity ASU 2020-06 ), which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current U.S. GAAP. ASU 2020-06 removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, which will permit more equity contracts to qualify for such exception and simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculation in certain areas. ASU 2020-06 is effective for public business entities that meet the definition of a SEC filer, excluding entities eligible to be smaller reporting companies as defined by the SEC, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2024. 
 On January 1, 2024, on adoption of ASU 2020-06, the Company determined that the April 2023 Conversion Feature Liability met the derivative accounting scope exception and the conversion feature no longer required bifurcation form the April 2023 Convertible Notes and April 2023 Convertible Notes, related party (see Note 10). On January 1, 2024, the fair value of the fair value of the April 2023 Conversion Feature Liability was zero. Therefore, the adoption had no impact on the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which includes amendments that further enhance income tax disclosures, primarily through standardization and disaggregation of rate reconciliation categories and income taxes paid by jurisdiction. The amendments are effective for all public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and should be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. The Company plans to adopt ASU 2023-09 and related updates on January 1, 2025. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the updated standard will have on its financial statement disclosures. 
 42 

There were no other recently issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements that will have a material effect on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 JOBS Act Accounting Election 
 We qualify as an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are not otherwise applicable to public companies. These provisions include, but are not limited to: 
 being permitted to present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-Q; 

not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting; 

not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis); 

reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation arrangements; and 

exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 

We may use these provisions until the last day of our fiscal year in which the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering occurs. However, if certain events occur prior to the end of such five-year period, including if we become a large accelerated filer, our annual gross revenue exceeds 1.235 billion, or we issue more than 1.0 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year period, we will cease to be an emerging growth company prior to the end of such five-year period. 
 We have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations in this Form 10-Q and may elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in future filings. As a result, the information that we provide to our shareholders may be different than the information you receive from other public companies in which you hold stock. 
 The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards, until those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period and, therefore, we will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. Until the date that we are no longer an emerging growth company or affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the exemption provided by Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act upon issuance of a new or revised accounting standard that applies to our financial statements and that has a different effective date for public and private companies, we will disclose the date on which we will adopt the recently issued accounting standard. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 Not applicable. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, mean controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal 
 43 

financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as describe below. 
 A material weakness is a control deficiency (within the meaning of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) Auditing Standard No. 2201) or combination of control deficiencies that result in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Management has identified the following material weaknesses: 
 Formal documentation of the Company s internal control over financial reporting including risk assessments and processes needed to mitigate critical risks does not exist. 

The Company lacks sufficient resources with respect to the number of people employed in its accounting department and the adequacy of their training in relation to its financial reporting requirements. 

The Company s internal control over financial reporting is ineffective with respect to its financial closing process in the following areas: 

o Preparation, review and approval of journal entries including the reasonableness of critical accounting estimates; 

o Completeness and proper cut-off of accrued liabilities; 

o Evaluation of third-party financial reporting advisors' capabilities and the monitoring and evaluation of the accuracy and completeness of their work product; 

o Timely closings as required to maintain compliance with reporting deadlines under applicable Securities and Exchange Commission regulations; and 

o Accuracy of diluted earnings per share calculation. 

The Company experienced difficulties in applying complex accounting principles including: 

o Financial instruments accounted for under ASC 480 and ASC 815-10; 

o Differentiating between contractual liabilities and gain and loss contingencies; and 

o Fair value measurements. 

Planned Remediation 
 Management continues to work to improve its controls related to our material weaknesses, specifically implementing improved processes and internal controls, and hiring outside consultants, to ensure the proper application of accounting practices and guidance. We also intend to increase our accounting staff as soon as economically feasible and sustainable to remediate these material weaknesses. These material weaknesses will not be considered to be remediated until the applicable remediated controls are operating for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded that these controls are operating effectively. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control 
 Except for the hiring of outside consultants as noted above, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 44 

We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings. At each reporting date, we evaluate whether a potential loss amount or a potential range of loss in respect of legal proceedings is probable and reasonably estimable under the provisions of the authoritative guidance that addresses accounting for contingencies. We expense the costs related to our legal proceedings as incurred. 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. There have been no material changes in or additions to the risk factors referred to in the previous sentence.
