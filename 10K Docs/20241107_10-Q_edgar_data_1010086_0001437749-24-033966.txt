 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (UNAUDITED) 

million. Current performance obligations represent the transaction price for which work has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options. With respect to current obligations related to the manufacture and delivery of product, the Company expects such obligations to be mostly recognized as revenues within the next months. With respect to the performance obligations related to research and development services, the Company expects such obligations to be recognized as revenue within the next four years as the specific timing for satisfying performance obligations is subjective and at times outside the Company's control. 

Performance Obligations 
 A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account in ASC 606. A contract s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. 
 
 Contract modifications may occur during the course of performance of our contracts. Contracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications or requirements. In most instances, contract modifications are for services that are not distinct, and, therefore, are accounted for as part of the existing contract. 
 
 The Company s performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in time. A portion of the Company's revenue is derived from long-term contracts that span multiple years. All of the Company s revenue related to current research and development performance obligations is recognized over time, because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the services as the Company performs these services. The Company recognizes revenue related to these services based on the progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation and measures this progress under an input method, which is based on the Company s cost incurred relative to total estimated costs. Under this method, progress is measured based on the cost of resources consumed (i.e., cost of third -party services performed, cost of direct labor hours incurred, and cost of materials consumed) compared to the total estimated costs to completely satisfy the performance obligation. Incurred costs represent work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the customer. The incurred and estimated costs used in the measure of progress include third -party services performed, direct labor hours, and material consumed. 
 
 Contract Balances 
 The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections may result in billed accounts receivable, unbilled receivables (contract assets) and customer advances and deposits (contract liabilities) in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Generally, amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms either at periodic intervals (monthly) or upon achievement of contractual milestones; as of September 30, 2024 , the accounts receivable balance in the condensed balance sheet includes approximately million of unbilled receivables. This amount includes international sales that are billed under the terms specified in the International Promotion Agreement with Meridian Medical Technologies, LLC Meridian ). Under typical payment terms of fixed price arrangements, the customer pays the Company either performance-based payments or progress payments. For the Company s cost-type arrangements, the customer generally pays the Company for its actual costs incurred, as well as its allocated overhead and G A. Such payments occur within a short period of time from billing. When the Company receives consideration, or such consideration is unconditionally due, prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of a sales contract, the Company records deferred revenue, which represents a contract liability. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company recognized approximately million of revenue that was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the period. 

courses of oral TPOXX to the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile ("Strategic Stockpile"), and to manufacture and deliver to the Strategic Stockpile, or store as vendor-managed inventory, up to courses of IV TPOXX . In October 2023, the contract was modified so that a course of IV TPOXX was redefined within the contract from being vials to being vials; as such, the 19C BARDA Contract currently specifies courses of IV TPOXX (for the same payment amount as originally specified). In addition to the delivery of TPOXX courses, the contract includes funding from BARDA for a range of activities, including: advanced development of IV TPOXX , post-marketing activities for oral and IV TPOXX , and procurement activities. As of September 30, 2024 , the contract with BARDA (as amended, modified, or supplemented from time to time, the "19C BARDA Contract") contemplates up to approximately million of payments, of which approximately million of payments are included within the base period of performance, approximately million of payments are related to exercised options, and up to approximately million of payments are currently specified as unexercised options. BARDA may choose in its sole discretion when, or whether, to exercise any of the unexercised options. The period of performance for options is up to ten years from the date of entry into the 19C BARDA Contract and such options could be exercised at any time during the contract term. 
 
 The base period of performance specifies potential payments of approximately million for the following activities: payments of approximately million for the delivery of approximately courses of oral TPOXX to the Strategic Stockpile; payments of million for the manufacture of courses (as currently defined within the contract as being 28 vials) of final drug product of IV TPOXX ("IV FDP"), of which million of payments are related to the manufacture of bulk drug substance ("IV BDS") to be used in the manufacture of IV FDP; payments of approximately million to fund reimbursed activities; and payments of approximately million for supportive procurement activities. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company had received million for the delivery of approximately courses of oral TPOXX to the Strategic Stockpile, million for the manufacture of IV BDS, million for the delivery of IV FDP to the Strategic Stockpile and million for other base period activities. IV BDS has been used for the manufacture of courses of IV FDP. The million received for the completed manufacture of IV BDS had been recorded as deferred revenue as of December 31, 2021, but with the delivery of IV FDP to the Strategic Stockpile during 2022, million was recognized as revenue. The remaining million of deferred revenue was recognized in the second quarter of 2024 as the IV FDP containing such IV BDS was delivered to and accepted by the Strategic Stockpile. 
 
 The options that have been exercised as of September 30, 2024 , provide for payments up to approximately million. As of September 30, 2024 , there are exercised options for the following activities: payments up to million for the manufacture and delivery of up to million courses of oral TPOXX payments up to million for the manufacture of courses of IV FDP, of which million of payments relate to the manufacture of IV BDS to be used in the manufacture of IV FDP; payments of up to approximately million to fund post-marketing activities for IV TPOXX and payments of up to million for funding of post-marketing activities for oral TPOXX . As of September 30, 2024 , a cumulative total of million of oral TPOXX has been delivered to the Strategic Stockpile and accepted, of which approximately million was delivered in the first quarter of 2024 and approximately million was delivered in the third quarter of 2024; the Company has cumulatively received million for the completed manufacture of IV BDS, of which million was recognized as revenue in the second quarter of 2024 as the IV FDP containing such IV BDS was delivered to and accepted by the Strategic Stockpile, and the remaining million was recorded as deferred revenue as of September 30, 2024 ; and the Company has b een cumulatively reimbursed million in connection with post-marketing activities for oral and IV TPOXX . In October 2024, million of oral TPOXX was delivered and/or accepted by the Strategic National Stockpile and million of IV TPOXX was delivered and/or accepted by the Strategic National Stockpile . 
 
 Une xercised options specify potential payments up to approx imately million in total (if all such options are exercised), of which approxim ately million relates to supportive activities that we currently do not expect to be required. The remaining unexercised options specify payments of up to million for the manufacture of courses of IV FDP, of which up to million of payments would be paid upon the manufacture of IV BDS to be used in the manufacture of IV FDP. 

The options related to IV TPOXX are divided into two primary manufacturing steps. There are options related to the manufacture of bulk drug substance IV BDS Options ), and there are corresponding options (for the same number of IV courses) for the manufacture of final drug product IV FDP Options ). BARDA may choose to exercise any, all, or none of these options in its sole discretion. The 19C BARDA Contract includes: three separate IV BDS Options, each providing for the bulk drug substance equivalent of courses (as currently defined within the contract) of IV TPOXX and three separate IV FDP Options, each providing for courses of final drug product of IV TPOXX . BARDA has the sole discretion as to whether to simultaneously exercise IV BDS Options and IV FDP Options, or whether to exercise options at different points in time (or alternatively, to only exercise the IV BDS Option but not the IV FDP Option). To date, BARDA has exercised two of the three IV BDS options and two of the three IV FDP options. If BARDA decides only to exercise the remaining IV BDS Option, then the Company would receive payments up to million; alternatively, if BARDA decides to exercise the remaining IV BDS Option and IV FDP Option, then the Company would receive payments up to million. BARDA may also decide not to exercise either remaining option. For each set of options relating to a specific group of courses (for instance, the IV BDS and IV FDP options that reference the same 32,000 courses), BARDA has the option to independently purchase IV BDS or IV FDP. 
 
 Revenues in connection with the 19C BARDA Contract are recognized either over time or at a point in time. Performance obligations related to product delivery generate revenue at a point in time. Revenue from other performance obligations under the 19C BARDA Contract are recognized over time using an input method using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company recognized revenues of million and million, respectively, on an over time basis. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company recognized revenues of million and million, respectively, on an over time basis. In contrast, revenue recognized for product delivery, and therefore at a point in time, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was million and million, respectively. revenue was recognized for product delivery, and therefore no revenue was recognized at a point in time, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 
 U.S. Department of Defense Procurement Contracts 
 On May 12, 2022, the Company announced a contract with the U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD") for the procurement of oral TPOXX ("DoD Contract #1" ). The DoD Contract #1 included a firm commitment for the DoD to procure approximately million of oral TPOXX , and an option, exercisable at the sole discretion of the DoD, for the procurement of an additional approximately million of oral TPOXX . In the second quarter of 2022, the Company delivered oral TPOXX to the DoD and recognized revenue of million, fulfilling the firm commitment in DoD Contract #1. In the third quarter of 2022, the DoD exercised the option for million of oral TPOXX and the Company satisfied its obligation by delivering product in September 2022 and recognized the related revenue. 
 
 On September 28, 2022, the Company and the DoD signed a second procurement contract ("DoD Contract #2" ). The DoD Contract #2 included a firm commitment for the DoD to procure approximately million of oral TPOXX , and an option, exercisable at the sole discretion of the DoD for the procurement of an additional approximately million of oral TPOXX . 
 
 In March 2023, the Company fulfilled the firm commitment by delivering million of oral TPOXX to the DoD, and recognized the related revenue. Additionally, in March 2023, the DoD exercised the million option in DoD Contract #2 for the procurement of oral TPOXX and the Company delivered these courses to the DoD in the fourth quarter of 2023 and recognized the related revenue. 
 
 In February 2024, DoD Contract #2 was amended and approximately million of oral TPOXX was ordered by the DoD, with delivery fulfilled in the first quarter of 2024. 
 
 In August 2024, the Company and the DoD signed a third procurement contract ("DoD Contract #3" for the firm commitment order by the DoD of approximately million of oral TPOXX as well as a minor amount of IV TPOXX . 
 
 International Sales Activity 
 In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company had international sales of million and million, respectively. Sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consist of deliveries of oral TPOXX to 12 countries. Sales in the first and second quarters were made under the International Promotion Agreement (defined and discussed below). Through the International Promotion Agreement, Meridian was the counterparty to international contracts under which the sales were made. 

Under the terms of the current International Promotion Agreement, which was amended on March 27, 2024 and effective June 1, 2024, and further amended on August 30, 2024, the Company has primary responsibility for the advertising, promotion and sale of oral TPOXX in all geographic regions. Meridian has limited, non-exclusive rights to advertise, promote, offer for sale and sell oral TPOXX in the European Economic Area, Australia, Japan, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and its member states (collectively, the Current Territory ). Meridian also performs non-promotional activities under specified existing contracts with third parties providing for the sale of oral TPOXX . The International Promotion Agreement provides that Meridian is entitled to receive a fee equal to a high single digit percentage of collected proceeds (whether collected by Meridian or the Company), net of certain expenses, of sales of oral TPOXX in the Current Territory in the field of use specified in the International Promotion Agreement. The International Promotion Agreement has a fixed term that expires on May 31, 2026, with no automatic renewal. 
 
 Under the terms of the original International Promotion Agreement Pre-amendment International Promotion Agreement ), which had an initial term that expired on May 31, 2024, Meridian had been granted exclusive rights to market, advertise, promote, offer for sale, or sell oral TPOXX in a field of use specified in the International Promotion Agreement in all geographic regions except for the United States (the Territory ), and Meridian agreed not to commercialize any competing product, as defined in the Pre-amendment International Promotion Agreement, in the specified field of use in the Territory. Under the Pre-amendment International Promotion Agreement, as well as the current International Promotion Agreement, SIGA has always retained ownership, intellectual property, distribution and supply rights and regulatory responsibilities in connection with TPOXX , and, in the United States market, also retained sales and marketing rights with respect to oral TPOXX . SIGA s consent is required prior to the entry by Meridian into any sales arrangement pursuant to the International Promotion Agreement. 
 
 Sales to international customers pursuant to the Pre-amendment International Promotion Agreement were invoiced and collected by Meridian, and such collections were remitted, less Meridian s fees, to the Company under a quarterly process specified in the Pre-amendment International Promotion Agreement; and Meridian was entitled to a specified percentage of the collected proceeds of sales of oral TPOXX , net of certain expenses, for calendar years in which customer collected amounts net of such expenses were less than or equal to a specified threshold, and to a higher specified percentage of such collected net proceeds for calendar years in which such net collected amounts exceeded the specified threshold. Subsequent to June 1, 2024, only specified procurement contracts in the European Economic Area and Asia Pacific region continue to involve Meridian invoicing and collecting proceeds, and retaining a fee pursuant to the International Promotion Agreement. Any fees retained by Meridian will be equal to a high single digit percentage of collected proceeds. 
 
 Revenue in connection with international procurement contracts for the delivery of product are recognized at a point in time on a gross basis, as the Company acts as the principal in the transaction. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company recognized million and million of sales, respectively, in connection with international contracts. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company recognized million and million of sales, respectively, in connection with international contracts. 
 
 Research Agreements and Grants 
 In July 2019, the Company was awarded a multi-year research contract ultimately valued at approximately million from the DoD to support work in pursuit of a potential label expansion for oral TPOXX that would include post-exposure prophylaxis ("PEP") of smallpox (such work known as the "PEP Label Expansion Program" and the contract referred to as the "PEP Label Expansion R D Contract"). As of December 31, 2023, the Company invoiced the full amount of available funding, and there is no remaining revenue to be recognized in the future under the PEP Label Expansion R D Contract. Revenue from the performance obligation under the PEP Label Expansion R D Contract was recognized over time using an input method using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion. The Company did not recognize any revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company, under the PEP Label Expansion R D Contract, recognized revenue of million and million, respectively, on an over time basis. 
 
 Contracts and grants include, among other things, options that may or may not be exercised at the U.S. Government s discretion. Moreover, contracts and grants contain customary terms and conditions including the U.S. Government s right to terminate or restructure a contract or grant for convenience at any time. As such, the Company may not be eligible to receive all available funds.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , weighted-average diluted shares include the dilutive effect of in-the-money options and stock-settled RSUs. The dilutive effect of stock-settled RSUs and options is calculated based on the average share price for each fiscal period using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options, the average amount of compensation cost for future service that the Company has not yet recognized, and the amount of tax benefits that would be recorded in additional paid-in capital when the award becomes deductible, are collectively assumed to be used to repurchase shares. Cash-settled RSUs were presumed to be cash-settled and therefore excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 because the net effect of their inclusion, including the elimination of the impact in the operating results of the change in fair value of these RSUs, would have been anti-dilutive. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the weighted average number of shares under the cash-settled RSUs excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share were and , respectively. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company incurred losses and as a result, the equity instruments listed below were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share as the effect of the exercise, conversion or vesting of such instruments would have been anti-dilutive. The weighted average number of equity instruments excluded consists of:

 The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the Act was signed into U.S. law on August 16, 2022. The Act includes various tax provisions, including an excise tax on stock repurchases, expanded tax credits for clean energy incentives, and a corporate alternative minimum tax that generally applies to U.S. corporations with average adjusted annual financial statement income over a three -year period in excess of 1 billion. The Company does not expect the Act to materially impact its consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Effective beginning in fiscal 2022, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Job Act of 2017 ("TCJA") requires the Company to deduct U.S. and international research and development expenditures ("R D") for tax purposes over 5 to 15 years, instead of in the current fiscal year. The Company concurrently records a deferred tax benefit for the future amortization of the research and development for tax purposes. The requirement to expense R D as incurred is unchanged for U.S. GAAP purposes and the impact to pre-tax R D expense is not affected by this provision.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 12, 2024 (the "2023 Form 10-K"). In addition to historical information, the following discussion and other parts of this Quarterly Report contain forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties . SIGA s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. See the factors set forth under the heading Forward-Looking Statements at the end of this Item 2 and in Item 1A. Risk Factors of the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Overview 
 
 SIGA Technologies, Inc. SIGA or the Company is a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company. The Company sells its lead product, TPOXX oral TPOXX , also known as "tecovirimat" or "Tecovirimat-SIGA" in certain international markets), to the U.S. Government and international governments (including government affiliated entities). In certain international markets, the Company may sell TPOXX through a distributor. Additionally, the Company sells the intravenous formulation of TPOXX ("IV TPOXX ") to the U.S. Government. 
 
 TPOXX is an oral formulation antiviral drug for the treatment of human smallpox disease caused by variola virus. On July 13, 2018, the United States Food Drug Administration FDA approved oral TPOXX for the treatment of smallpox. The Company has been delivering oral TPOXX to the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile ("Strategic Stockpile") since 2013. 
 
 In connection with IV TPOXX , SIGA announced on May 19, 2022 that the FDA approved this formulation for the treatment of smallpox. 
 
 In addition to being approved by the FDA, oral TPOXX (tecovirimat) has regulatory approval with the European Medicines Agency ("EMA"), Health Canada and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency ("MHRA") of the United Kingdom. The EMA and MHRA approved label indication covers the treatment of smallpox, monkeypox ("mpox"), cowpox, and vaccinia complications following vaccination against smallpox. The Health Canada approved label indication covers the treatment of smallpox. 
 
 With respect to the regulatory approvals by the EMA, MHRA and Health Canada, oral tecovirimat represents the same formulation that was approved by the FDA in July 2018 under the brand name TPOXX . 
 
 In connection with a potential FDA label expansion of oral TPOXX for an indication covering smallpox post-exposure prophylaxis PEP ), the Company completed an immunogenicity trial and an expanded safety trial in early 2023. The nature and timing of a potential submission of a supplemental New Drug Application to the FDA Supplemental NDA for a smallpox PEP indication for oral TPOXX will be based on the results of the trials; the Company is currently targeting a Supplemental NDA filing to occur in the third quarter of 2025. 
 
 In connection with the 2022 global response to an mpox outbreak, a series of observational and randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials were initiated to assess the safety and efficacy of TPOXX in participants with mpox. These randomized clinical trials are seeking to collect data on the potential benefits of using TPOXX as an antiviral treatment for active mpox disease. As of September 30, 2024, there were four active randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials enrolling patients, subject to patient availability, at sites located in, among other places, the United States and South America. Additionally, a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ("DRC") known as PALM 007 (Tecovirimat for Treatment of Monkeypox Virus - NCT05559099), which is funded and sponsored by the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), recently completed enrollment and reported preliminary topline results. Although the study did not meet its primary endpoint of a statistically significant improvement in time to lesion resolution within 28 days post-randomization for patients in the DRC with monkeypox (mpox), who were administered TPOXX compared to patients who were administered placebo, improvement versus placebo was observed in patients receiving TPOXX whose symptoms began seven days or fewer before randomization and patients with severe or grave disease, defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as having 100 or more skin lesions. 
 
 The Company may be able to use data from the trials noted above, as well as from other trials, to pursue a potential label expansion with the FDA for oral TPOXX as a treatment for mpox. The viability, and timing, of a potential FDA submission for an mpox indication will be impacted by a series of factors, including the magnitude and severity of future mpox cases, the location of future cases, enrollment in clinical trials, and final results of randomized, placebo-controlled and observational clinical trials. 
 
 On April 11, 2024, the Company s partner in Japan, Japan Biotechno Pharma, announced that a new drug application for oral TPOXX (tecovirimat) was filed in Japan for the treatment of smallpox, mpox, cowpox, and complications due to vaccinia virus. Based on the standard review time for a new drug application in Japan, we anticipate a final regulatory decision by the end of the first quarter of 2025.

Procurement Contracts with the U.S. Government 
 
 19C BARDA Contract 

On September 10, 2018, the Company entered into a contract with the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority ("BARDA") pursuant to which SIGA agreed to deliver up to 1,488,000 courses of oral TPOXX to the Strategic Stockpile, and to manufacture and deliver to the Strategic Stockpile, or store as vendor-managed inventory, up to 212,000 courses of IV TPOXX . In October 2023, the contract was modified so that a course of IV TPOXX was redefined within the contract from being 14 vials to being 28 vials; as such, the 19C BARDA Contract currently specifies 106,000 courses of IV TPOXX (for the same payment amount as originally specified). In addition to the delivery of TPOXX courses, the contract includes funding from BARDA for a range of activities, including: advanced development of IV TPOXX , post-marketing activities for oral and IV TPOXX , and procurement activities. As of September 30, 2024, the contract with BARDA (as amended, modified, or supplemented from time to time, the "19C BARDA Contract") contemplates up to approximately 602.5 million of payments, of which approximately 51.7 million of payments are included within the base period of performance, approximately 519.6 million of payments are related to exercised options and up to approximately 31.2 million of payments are currently specified as unexercised options. BARDA may choose in its sole discretion when, or whether, to exercise any of the unexercised options. The period of performance for options is up to ten years from the date of entry into the 19C BARDA Contract and such options could be exercised at any time during the contract term. 
 
 The base period of performance specifies potential payments of approximately 51.7 million for the following activities: payments of approximately 11.1 million for the delivery of approximately 35,700 courses of oral TPOXX to the Strategic Stockpile; payments of 8.0 million for the manufacture of 10,000 courses (as currently defined within the contract as being 28 vials) of final drug product of IV TPOXX ("IV FDP"), of which 3.2 million of payments are related to the manufacture of bulk drug substance ("IV BDS") to be used in the manufacture of IV FDP; payments of approximately 32.0 million to fund reimbursed activities; and payments of approximately 0.6 million for supportive procurement activities. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had received 11.1 million for the delivery of approximately 35,700 courses of oral TPOXX to the Strategic Stockpile, 3.2 million for the manufacture of IV BDS, 4.8 million for the delivery of IV FDP to the Strategic Stockpile and 24.7 million for other base period activities. IV BDS has been used for the manufacture of courses of IV FDP. The 3.2 million received for the completed manufacture of IV BDS had been recorded as deferred revenue as of December 31, 2021, but with the delivery of IV FDP to the Strategic Stockpile during 2022, 2.9 million was recognized as revenue. The remaining 0.3 million of deferred revenue was recognized in the second quarter of 2024 as the IV FDP containing such IV BDS was delivered to and accepted by the Strategic Stockpile. 

The options that have been exercised as of September 30, 2024, provide for payments up to approximately 519.6 million. As of September 30, 2024, there are exercised options for the following activities: payments up to 450.2 million for the manufacture and delivery of up to 1.5 million courses of oral TPOXX payments up to 51.2 million for the manufacture of courses of IV FDP, of which 20.5 million of payments relate to the manufacture of IV BDS to be used in the manufacture of IV FDP; payments of up to approximately 3.6 million to fund post-marketing activities for IV TPOXX and payments of up to 14.6 million for funding of post-marketing activities for oral TPOXX . As of September 30, 2024, a cumulative total of 345.8 million of oral TPOXX has been delivered to the Strategic Stockpile and accepted, of which approximately 15 million was delivered in the first quarter of 2024 and approximately 8 million was delivered in the third quarter of 2024; the Company has cumulatively received 20.5 million for the completed manufacture of IV BDS, of which 6.8 million was recognized as revenue in the second quarter of 2024 as the IV FDP containing such IV BDS was delivered to and accepted by the Strategic Stockpile, and the remaining 13.7 million was recorded as deferred revenue as of September 30, 2024; and the Company has been cumulatively reimbursed 9.0 million in connection with post-marketing activities for oral and IV TPOXX . In October 2024, 51.2 million of oral TPOXX was delivered and/or accepted by the Strategic National Stockpile and 8.5 million of IV TPOXX was delivered and/or accepted by the Strategic National Stockpile. 
 
 Unexercised options specify potential payments up to approximately 31.2 million in total (if all such options are exercised), of which approximately 5.6 million relates to supportive activities that we currently do not expect to be required. The remaining unexercised options specify payments of up to 25.6 million for the manufacture of courses of IV FDP, of which up to 10.2 million of payments would be paid upon the manufacture of IV BDS to be used in the manufacture of IV FDP. 
 
 The options related to IV TPOXX are divided into two primary manufacturing steps. There are options related to the manufacture of bulk drug substance IV BDS Options ), and there are corresponding options (for the same number of IV courses) for the manufacture of final drug product IV FDP Options ). BARDA may choose to exercise any, all, or none of these options in its sole discretion. The 19C BARDA Contract includes: three separate IV BDS Options, each providing for the bulk drug substance equivalent of 32,000 courses (as currently defined within the contract) of IV TPOXX and three separate IV FDP Options, each providing for 32,000 courses of final drug product of IV TPOXX . BARDA has the sole discretion as to whether to simultaneously exercise IV BDS Options and IV FDP Options, or whether to exercise options at different points in time (or alternatively, to only exercise the IV BDS Option but not the IV FDP Option). To date, BARDA has exercised two of the three IV BDS options and two of the three IV FDP options. If BARDA decides only to exercise the remaining IV BDS Option, then the Company would receive payments up to 10.2 million; alternatively, if BARDA decides to exercise the remaining IV BDS Option and IV FDP Option, then the Company would receive payments up to 25.6 million. BARDA may also decide not to exercise either remaining option. For each set of options relating to a specific group of courses (for instance, the IV BDS and IV FDP options that reference the same 32,000 courses), BARDA has the option to independently purchase IV BDS or IV FDP. The Company estimates that sales of the IV formulation under this contract (under current terms), assuming the remaining IV FDP Option was exercised, would have a gross margin (sales less cost of sales, as a percentage of sales) that is less than 40 .

U.S. Department of Defense Procurement Contracts 
 
 On May 12, 2022, the Company announced a contract with the U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD") for the procurement of oral TPOXX ("DoD Contract #1"). The DoD Contract #1 included a firm commitment for the DoD to procure approximately 3.6 million of oral TPOXX , and an option, exercisable at the sole discretion of the DoD, for the procurement of an additional approximately 3.8 million of oral TPOXX . In the second quarter of 2022, the Company delivered oral TPOXX to the DoD and recognized revenue of 3.6 million, fulfilling the firm commitment in DoD Contract #1. In the third quarter of 2022, the DoD exercised the option for 3.8 million of oral TPOXX and the Company satisfied its obligation by delivering product in September 2022 and recognized the related revenue. 
 
 On September 28, 2022, the Company and the DoD signed a second procurement contract ("DoD Contract #2"). The DoD Contract #2 included a firm commitment for the DoD to procure approximately 5.1 million of oral TPOXX , and an option, exercisable at the sole discretion of the DoD for the procurement of an additional approximately 5.5 million of oral TPOXX . 
 
 In March 2023, the Company fulfilled the firm commitment by delivering 5.1 million of oral TPOXX to the DoD, and recognized the related revenue. Additionally, in March 2023, the DoD exercised the 5.5 million option in DoD Contract #2 for the procurement of oral TPOXX and the Company delivered these courses to the DoD in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 
 In February 2024, DoD Contract #2 was amended and approximately 1 million of oral TPOXX was ordered by the DoD, with delivery fulfilled in the first quarter of 2024. 
 
 In August 2024, the Company and the DoD signed a third procurement contract ("DoD Contract #3") for the firm commitment order by the DoD of approximately 9 million of oral TPOXX as well as a minor amount of IV TPOXX . 

International Sales Activity 
 
 In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had international sales of 0.8 million and 11.8 million, respectively. Sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consist of deliveries of oral TPOXX to 12 countries. Sales in the first and second quarters were made under the International Promotion Agreement (defined and discussed below). Through the International Promotion Agreement, Meridian was the counterparty to international contracts under which the sales were made. 

International Promotion Agreement 
 
 Under the terms of the current International Promotion Agreement, which was amended on March 27, 2024 and effective June 1, 2024, and further amended on August 30, 2024, the Company has primary responsibility for the advertising, promotion and sale of oral TPOXX in all geographic regions. Meridian has limited, non-exclusive rights to advertise, promote, offer for sale and sell oral TPOXX in the European Economic Area, Australia, Japan, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and its member states (collectively, the Current Territory ). Meridian also performs non-promotional activities under specified existing contracts with third parties providing for the sale of oral TPOXX . The International Promotion Agreement provides that Meridian is entitled to receive a fee equal to a high single digit percentage of collected proceeds (whether collected by Meridian or the Company), net of certain expenses, of sales of oral TPOXX in the Current Territory in the field of use specified in the International Promotion Agreement. The International Promotion Agreement has a fixed term that expires on May 31, 2026, with no automatic renewal. 
 
 Under the terms of the original International Promotion Agreement Pre-amendment International Promotion Agreement ), which had an initial term that expired on May 31, 2024, Meridian had been granted exclusive rights to market, advertise, promote, offer for sale, or sell oral TPOXX in a field of use specified in the International Promotion Agreement in all geographic regions except for the United States (the Territory ), and Meridian agreed not to commercialize any competing product, as defined in the Pre-amendment International Promotion Agreement, in the specified field of use in the Territory. Under the Pre-amendment International Promotion Agreement, as well as the current International Promotion Agreement, SIGA has always retained ownership, intellectual property, distribution and supply rights and regulatory responsibilities in connection with TPOXX , and, in the United States market, also retained sales and marketing rights with respect to oral TPOXX . SIGA s consent is required prior to the entry by Meridian into any sales arrangement pursuant to the International Promotion Agreement. 
 
 Sales to international customers pursuant to the Pre-amendment International Promotion Agreement were invoiced and collected by Meridian, and such collections were remitted, less Meridian s fees, to the Company under a quarterly process specified in the Pre-amendment International Promotion Agreement; and Meridian was entitled to a specified percentage of the collected proceeds of sales of oral TPOXX , net of certain expenses, for calendar years in which customer collected amounts net of such expenses were less than or equal to a specified threshold, and to a higher specified percentage of such collected net proceeds for calendar years in which such net collected amounts exceeded the specified threshold. Subsequent to June 1, 2024, only specified procurement contracts in the European Economic Area and Asia Pacific region continue to involve Meridian invoicing and collecting proceeds, and retaining a fee pursuant to the International Promotion Agreement. Any fees retained by Meridian will be equal to a high single digit percentage of collected proceeds. 

Research Agreements and Grants 

In July 2019, the Company was awarded a multi-year research contract ultimately valued at approximately 27 million from the DoD to support work in pursuit of a potential label expansion for oral TPOXX that would include post-exposure prophylaxis PEP of smallpox (such work known as the PEP Label Expansion Program and the contract referred to as the PEP Label Expansion R D Contract ). As of December 31, 2023, the Company invoiced the full amount of available funding, and there is no remaining revenue to be recognized in the future under the PEP Label Expansion R D Contract. Revenue from the performance obligation under the PEP Label Expansion R D Contract was recognized over time using an input method using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion.

Contracts and grants include, among other things, options that may or may not be exercised at the U.S. Government s discretion. Moreover, contracts and grants contain customary terms and conditions including the U.S. Government s right to terminate or restructure a contract or grant for convenience at any time. As such, the Company may not be eligible to receive all available funds.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our condensed consolidated financial statements, which we discuss under the heading Results of Operations following this section of our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Information regarding our critical accounting policies and estimates appears in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2023 Form 10-K. Our most critical accounting estimates include revenue recognition over time and income taxes (including realization of deferred tax assets). 

Results of Operations 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenues from product sales and supportive services were 8.9 million. Such revenues include 8.1 million of Oral TPOXX sales to the U.S. Government under the 19C BARDA Contract, and 0.8 million of oral TPOXX international sales. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, revenues from product sales and supportive services were 8.0 million. Such revenues primarily relate to a sale of oral TPOXX to a European country and a Middle Eastern country. 
 
 Revenues from research and development activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 1.1 million and 1.3 million, respectively. The revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were mostly earned in connection with performance of research and development activities under the 19C BARDA Contract. The revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023, were mostly earned in connection with performance of research and development activities under the PEP Label Expansion R D Contract and the 19C BARDA Contract. The decrease of 0.2 million of revenue is primarily related to the completion of billable activities under the PEP Label Expansion R D Contract. 
 
 Cost of sales and supportive services for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 1.6 million and 0.9 million, respectively. Such costs in 2024 were associated with the manufacture and delivery of courses of Oral TPOXX to the U.S. Government under the 19C BARDA Contract. Such costs in 2023 were associated with the manufacture and delivery of courses of oral TPOXX to a European country and a Middle Eastern country, and the costs of supportive activities such as customary, periodic stability testing. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 4.8 million and 6.0 million, respectively. The decrease of approximately 1.2 million primarily reflects the decrease in international promotion fees due to the decrease in international sales in 2024 in comparison to the same period in 2023, partially offset by higher compensation expense associated with the hiring of multiple executive officers this year. 
 
 Research and development R D expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 3.0 million and 3.6 million, respectively, reflecting a decrease of approximately 0.6 million. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower direct vendor-related expenses incurred in connection with a decrease in activities under the PEP Label Expansion R D Contract, partially offset by an increase in compensation expense in connection with an increase in headcount. 
 
 Other income, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 1.3 million and 0.9 million, respectively. These amounts reflect interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues from product sales and supportive services were 53.5 million. Such revenues include 17.6 million of IV TPOXX and 22.8 million of oral TPOXX sales to the U.S. Government under the 19C BARDA Contract, 11.8 million of oral TPOXX international sales and approximately 1.1 million of oral TPOXX sales to the DoD. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, revenues from product sales and supportive services were 14.9 million. Such revenues primarily relate to sales of approximately 5.1 million of oral TPOXX to the DoD and approximately 9.1 million of international sales of oral TPOXX . 
 
 Revenues from research and development activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 3.8 million and 8.5 million, respectively. The revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were mostly earned in connection with performance of research and development activities under the 19C BARDA Contract. The revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, were mostly earned in connection with performance of research and development activities under the PEP Label Expansion R D Contract and the 19C BARDA Contract. The decrease of 4.7 million of revenue is primarily related to the completion of billable activities under the PEP Label Expansion R D Contract. 
 
 Cost of sales and supportive services for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 17.2 million and 3.0 million, respectively. Such costs in 2024 were primarily associated with the manufacture and delivery of courses of IV and oral TPOXX to the U.S. Government under the 19C BARDA Contract, as well as the manufacture and delivery of oral TPOXX to multiple international countries and the DoD. Such costs in 2023 are associated with: lower sales volume and a different product mix than 2024; the manufacture and delivery of courses of oral TPOXX to the DoD and three international customers; an inventory-related loss in connection with impairment of a manufacturing batch; manufacturing costs related to a potential backup facility within a segment of the supply chain, and the costs of supportive activities such as customary, periodic stability testing. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 18.2 million and 14.7 million, respectively. The increase of approximately 3.5 million primarily reflects; an increase in international promotion fees due to an increase in international sales in 2024 in comparison to the same period in 2023; and higher compensation expense associated with the hiring of multiple executive officers this year. 
 
 Research and development R D expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 9.0 million and 13.8 million, respectively, reflecting a decrease of approximately 4.8 million. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower direct vendor-related expenses incurred in connection with a decrease in activities under the PEP Label Expansion R D Contract, partially offset by an increase in compensation expense in connection with an increase in headcount. 
 
 Other income, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 4.6 million and 3.0 million, respectively. The increase relates to interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents as the average cash balance during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were higher than the same period in 2023. Additionally, the average investment rates in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were higher than those in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded pre-tax income/(losses) of 17.5 million and 5.1) million, respectively, and a corresponding income tax (provision)/benefit of 4.0) million and 0.9 million, respectively. The effective tax rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 23.1 and 17.8 , respectively. Our effective tax rates for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 differ from the statutory rate primarily as a result of state taxes and non-deductible executive compensation under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m). 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 99.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared with 150.1 million at December 31, 2023. We believe that our liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated requirements for at least the next twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements. 
 
 Operating Activities 
 We prepare our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows using the indirect method. Under this method, we reconcile net income/(loss) to cash flows from operating activities by adjusting net income/(loss) for those items that impact net income/(loss) but may not result in actual cash receipts or payments during the period. These reconciling items include but are not limited to stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes, and changes in the condensed consolidated balance sheet for working capital from the beginning to the end of the period. 
 
 Net cash (used in)/provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 7.5) million and 15.8 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the receipt of approximately 55 million from sales of oral and IV TPOXX to the U.S. Government and international customers, of which approximately 35 million relates to 2024 sales and the remainder to accounts receivable at December 31, 2023, was offset by the payment of approximately 29 million of income taxes as well as for the use of cash for inventory and customary operating activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the receipt of substantially all of the 45 million of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022, as well as approximately 10 million received in connection with IV BDS deferred revenue was partially offset by the use of cash to proactively build inventory, and for customary operating activities. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 There was minimal (less than 25,000) cash-related investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 43.3 million, which was mostly attributable to the payment of a special cash dividend of approximately 42.7 million. Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 43.4 million, which was mostly attributable to the payment of a special cash dividend of approximately 32.1 million and the repurchase of approximately 1.7 million shares of common stock for approximately 11.0 million. 
 
 Future Cash Requirements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding purchase orders associated with manufacturing obligations in the aggregate amount of approximately 3.3 million.

 Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. All statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 
 
 Forward-looking statements include statements regarding our future financial position, business strategy, budgets, projected costs, plans and objectives of management for future operations. The words may, continue, estimate, intend, plan, will, believe, project, expect, seek, anticipate, could, should, target, goal, potential and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Such forward-looking statements are subject to various known and unknown risks and uncertainties, and SIGA cautions you that any forward-looking information provided by or on behalf of SIGA is not a guarantee of future performance. SIGA s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, some of which are beyond SIGA s control, including, but not limited to, (i) the risk that BARDA elects, in its sole discretion as permitted under the 19C BARDA Contract, not to exercise the remaining unexercised option under the 19C BARDA Contract, (ii) the risk that SIGA may not complete performance under the 19C BARDA Contract on schedule or in accordance with contractual terms, (iii) the risk that the 19C BARDA Contract or PEP Label Expansion R D Contract are modified or canceled at the request or requirement of, or SIGA is not able to enter into new contracts to supply TPOXX to, the U.S. Government, (iv) the risk that the nascent international biodefense market does not develop to a degree that allows SIGA to continue to successfully market TPOXX internationally, (v) the risk that potential products, including potential alternative uses or formulations of TPOXX that appear promising to SIGA or its collaborators, cannot be shown to be efficacious or safe in subsequent pre-clinical or clinical trials, (vi) the risk that target timing for deliveries of product to customers, and the recognition of related revenues, are delayed or adversely impacted by the actions, or inaction, of contract manufacturing organizations, or other vendors, within the supply chain, or due to coordination activities between the customer and supply chain vendors, (vii) the risk that SIGA or its collaborators will not obtain appropriate or necessary governmental approvals to market these or other potential products or uses, (viii) the risk that SIGA may not be able to secure or enforce sufficient legal rights in its products, including intellectual property protection, (ix) the risk that any challenge to SIGA s patent and other property rights, if adversely determined, could affect SIGA s business and, even if determined favorably, could be costly, (x) the risk that regulatory requirements applicable to SIGA s products may result in the need for further or additional testing or documentation that will delay or prevent SIGA from seeking or obtaining needed approvals to market these products, (xi) the risk that the volatile and competitive nature of the biotechnology industry may hamper SIGA s efforts to develop or market its products, (xii) the risk that changes in domestic or foreign economic and market conditions may affect SIGA s ability to advance its research or may affect its products adversely, (xiii) the effect of federal, state, and foreign regulation, including drug regulation and international trade regulation, on SIGA s businesses, (xiv) the risk of disruptions to SIGA s supply chain for the manufacture of TPOXX , causing delays in SIGA s research and development activities, causing delays or the re-allocation of funding in connection with SIGA s government contracts, or diverting the attention of government staff overseeing SIGA s government contracts, (xv) risks associated with actions or uncertainties surrounding the debt ceiling, (xvi) the risk that the U.S. or foreign governments' responses (including inaction) to national or global economic conditions or infectious diseases, are ineffective and may adversely affect SIGA s business, and (xvii) risks associated with responding to an mpox outbreak, as well as the risks and uncertainties included in Item 1A Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and SIGA's subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. SIGA urges investors and security holders to read those documents free of charge at the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. All such forward-looking statements are current only as of the date on which such statements were made. SIGA does not undertake any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which any such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. The information contained on any website referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Our investment portfolio includes cash and cash equivalents. Our main investment objectives are the preservation of investment capital. We believe that our investment policy is conservative, both in the duration of our investments and the credit quality of the investments we hold. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments, derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments, positions or transactions to manage exposure to interest rate changes. As such, we believe that the securities we hold are subject to market risk and changes in the financial standing of the issuers of such securities and our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 
 Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II-OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 From time to time, we may be involved in a variety of claims, suits, investigations and proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business, including collections claims, breach of contract claims, labor and employment claims, tax related matters and other matters. Although such claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the resolution of such current pending matters, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.

Each of the provisions contained in this Letter Amendment will be severable, and the unenforceability of one will not affect the enforceability of any others or of the remainder of this Agreement. If any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement, or the application thereof in any circumstances, is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect for any reason, the Parties will negotiate in good faith with a view to the substitution therefor of a suitable and equitable solution to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid provision; provided, however , that the validity, legality and enforceability of any such provision in every other respect and of the remaining provisions of this Agreement will not be in any way impaired thereby, it being intended that all of the rights and privileges of the Parties hereto will be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by Law.

8. 

Each Party may execute this Agreement by facsimile transmission or by PDF. In addition, facsimile or PDF signatures of authorized signatories of any Party will be deemed to be original signatures and will be valid and binding, and delivery of a facsimile or PDF signature by any Party will constitute due execution and delivery of this Agreement.
