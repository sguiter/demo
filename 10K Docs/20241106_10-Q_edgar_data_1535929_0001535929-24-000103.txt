 NOTE CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including "Risk Factors," and "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include statements relating to future developments in our business or expectations for our future financial performance and any statement not involving a historical fact. Forward-looking statements use words such as "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "plan," and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance. Actual results, performance or events may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement due to, among other things, (i) global market risks, including general economic conditions, our ability to manage such risks and interest rates; (ii) liquidity and credit risks, including financial strength or credit ratings downgrades, requirements to post collateral, and availability of funds through dividends from our subsidiaries or lending programs; (iii) strategic and business risks, including our ability to maintain market share, achieve desired results from our acquisitions and dispositions, or otherwise manage our third-party relationships; (iv) investment risks, including the ability to achieve desired returns and liquidate certain assets; (v) operational risks, including cybersecurity and privacy failures and our dependence on third parties; and (vi) tax, regulatory and legal risks, including limits on our ability to use deferred tax assets, changes in law, regulation or accounting standards, and our ability to comply with regulations. Factors that may cause actual results to differ from those in any forward-looking statement also include those described under "Risk Factors," "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Trends and Uncertainties" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K and in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 The risks included here are not exhaustive. Current reports on Form 8-K and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") include additional factors that could affect our businesses and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors.

Those estimates are inherently subject to change and actual results could differ from those estimates, and the differences may be material to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Voya Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries, as well as other voting interest entities ("VOEs") and variable interest entities ("VIEs") in which the Company has a controlling financial interest.

 The Company may sell securities during the period in which fair value has declined below amortized cost for fixed maturities. In certain situations, new factors, including changes in the business environment, can change the Company s previous intent to continue holding a security. Accordingly, these factors may lead the Company to record additional intent related capital losses. 
 
 Debt Modifications 
 
 The Company evaluates all debt modifications to determine whether a modification results in a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan. Disclosures are required for loan modifications with borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had material debt modifications that require such disclosure. 
 
 Mortgage Loans on Real Estate 
 
 The Company diversifies its commercial mortgage loan portfolio by geographic region and property type to reduce concentration risk. The Company manages risk when originating commercial mortgage loans by generally lending only up to of the estimated fair value of the underlying real estate. Subsequently, the Company continuously evaluates mortgage loans based on relevant current information including a review of loan-specific performance, property characteristics and market trends. Loan performance is monitored on a loan specific basis through the review of submitted appraisals, operating statements, rent revenues and annual inspection reports, among other items. This review ensures properties are performing at a consistent and acceptable level to secure the debt. The components to evaluate debt service coverage are received and reviewed at least annually to determine the level of risk. 
 
 Loan-to-value ("LTV") and debt service coverage ("DSC") ratios are measures commonly used to assess the risk and quality of mortgage loans. These ratios are utilized as part of the review process described above.

 Valuation of Financial Assets and Liabilities at Fair Value 
 
 Certain assets and liabilities are measured at estimated fair value on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The exit price and the transaction (or entry) price will be the same at initial recognition in many circumstances. However, in certain cases, the transaction price may not represent fair value. The fair value of a liability is based

 For other matters, the Company is currently not able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss. The Company is often unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss until developments in such matters have provided sufficient information to support an assessment of the range of possible loss, such as quantification of a damage demand from plaintiffs, discovery from plaintiffs and other parties, investigation of factual allegations, rulings by a court on motions or appeals, analysis by experts and the progress of settlement discussions. On a quarterly and annual basis, the Company reviews relevant information with respect to litigation and regulatory contingencies and updates the Company's accruals, disclosures and reasonably possible losses or ranges of loss based on such reviews. 
 
 Litigation includes Ravarino, et al. v. Voya Financial, Inc., et al. (USDC District of Connecticut, No. 3:21-cv-01658)(filed December 14, 2021). In this putative class action, the plaintiffs allege that the named defendants breached their fiduciary duties of prudence and loyalty in the administration of the Voya 401(k) Savings Plan. The plaintiffs claim that the named defendants did not exercise proper prudence in their management of allegedly poorly performing investment options, including proprietary funds, and passed excessive investment-management and other administrative fees for proprietary and non-proprietary funds onto plan participants. The plaintiffs also allege that the defendants engaged in self-dealing through the inclusion of the Voya Stable Value Option into the plan offerings and by setting the crediting rate for participants investment in the Stable Value Fund artificially low in relation to Voya s general account investment returns in order to maximize the spread and Voya s profits at the participants expense. The complaint seeks disgorgement of unjust profits as well as costs incurred. On June 13, 2023, the Court issued a ruling granting in part and denying in part Voya's motion to dismiss. The court largely dismissed the claims for breach of fiduciary duty. The remaining claims concern allegations of breaches of the ERISA prohibited transactions rule and a claim for failure to monitor the Voya Small Cap Growth fund. The Company continues to deny the allegations, which it believes are without merit, and intends to defend the case vigorously. 
 
 In November 2022, the Company acquired Czech Asset Management, L.P., pursuant to an agreement that provides for earn-out payments if certain contingencies are met. On March 11, 2024, the Company received from the sellers a demand for arbitration of a claim that the full amount of these earn-outs had become payable. The Company is opposing the claim in arbitration.

 and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. If the Company were to liquidate, the assets held by consolidated investment entities would not be available to the general creditors of the Company as a result of the liquidation. 
 
 Consolidated VIEs and VOEs 
 
 Collateral Loan Obligations Entities ("CLOs") 
 
 The Company is involved in the design, creation, and the ongoing management of CLOs. These entities are created for the purpose of acquiring diversified portfolios of senior secured floating rate leveraged loans, and securitizing these assets by issuing multiple tranches of collateralized debt; thereby providing investors with a broad array of risk and return profiles. Also known as collateralized financing entities under ASC Topic 810, CLOs are variable interest entities by definition. 
 
 In return for providing collateral management services, the Company earns investment management fees and contingent performance fees. In addition to earning fee income, the Company often invests in the subordinated debt of entities formed to be the issuers of CLO offerings during their warehouse periods. The Company s investments in these CLOs are repaid when the CLOs warehouse periods are closed and the CLO offerings are issued. The Company performs ongoing monitoring of the consolidation assessment for CLOs during and after their warehouse periods to determine if the Company remains the primary beneficiary of the CLOs. The fee income earned and investments held are included in the Company's ongoing consolidation assessment for each CLO. The Company was the primary beneficiary of and CLOs as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 life and a specified period during which investors can subscribe for limited partnership interests. Once the investors are admitted as limited partners, the investors are required to contribute capital when called by the general partners. The purpose of the LPs is to obtain subscriptions from limited partners and maximize the return to their partners by assembling a diversified portfolio of investments in private equity funds and other securities or assets with similar risk and return characteristics primarily through secondary market purchases. The majority of the investors in the LPs are unrelated parties to the Company. In return for subscriptions, each partner receives an equity interest in the LPs in proportion to its respective investment. These entities have been evaluated by the Company and are determined to be VIEs due to the equity holders, as a group, lacking the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. 
 
 In return for serving as the general partner of and providing investment management services to these entities, the Company earns management fees and carried interest in the normal course of business. Additionally, the Company often holds an investment in each limited partnership it manages, generally in the form of general partner and limited partner interests. The fee income, carried interest, and investments held are included in the Company s ongoing consolidation analysis for each limited partnership. The Company consolidated and partnerships as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 The noncontrolling interest related to partnerships decreased from at December 31, 2023 to at September 30, 2024. Changes in market value, consolidations, deconsolidations, contributions, and distributions related to these investments in the funds directly impact the noncontrolling interest component of Shareholders' equity on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The change in noncontrolling interest was primarily driven by an increase in net distributions, partially offset by favorable market appreciation in limited partnership investments. The Company records the noncontrolling interest using a lag methodology relying on the most recent financial information available. 
 Fair Value Measurement 
 
 Upon consolidation, the Company elected to apply the FVO for financial assets and financial liabilities held by CLOs and continued to measure these assets (primarily corporate loans) and liabilities (debt obligations issued by CLOs) at fair value in subsequent periods. The Company has elected the FVO to more closely align its accounting with the economics of its transactions and allows the Company to more effectively align changes in the fair value of CLO assets with a commensurate change in the fair value of CLO liabilities. 
 
 Investments held by consolidated private equity funds are measured and reported at fair value in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in the fair value of consolidated investment entities are recorded as a separate line item within Income (loss) related to consolidated investment entities in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 
 The methodology for measuring the fair value of financial assets and liabilities of consolidated investment entities, and the classification of these measurements in the fair value hierarchy is consistent with the methodology and classification applied by the Company to its investment portfolio, as discussed within the Fair Value Measurements (excluding Consolidated Investment Entities) Note to these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 As discussed in more detail below, the Company utilizes valuations obtained from third-party commercial pricing services, brokers and investment sponsors or third-party administrators that supply NAV (or its equivalent) per share used as a practical expedient. The valuations obtained from brokers and third-party commercial pricing services are non-binding. These valuations are reviewed on a monthly or quarterly basis depending on the entity and its underlying investments. Procedures include, but are not limited to, a review of underlying fund investor reports, review of top and worst performing funds requiring further scrutiny, review of variance from prior periods and review of variance from benchmarks, where applicable. In addition, the Company considers both macro and fund specific events that may impact the latest NAV supplied and determines if further adjustments of value should be made. Such changes, if any, are subject to senior management review. 
 
 When a price cannot be obtained from a commercial pricing service, independent broker quotes are solicited. Securities priced using independent broker quotes are classified as Level 3. Broker quotes and prices obtained from pricing services are reviewed

 (Dollar amounts in millions, unless otherwise stated) 

 . As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the unpaid principal balance exceeded the fair value of the corporate loans by approximately and , respectively. Less than of the collateral loans were in default as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 The fair values for corporate loans are determined using independent commercial pricing services. Fair value measurement based on pricing services may be classified in Level 2 or Level 3 depending on the type, complexity, observability and liquidity of the asset being measured. The inputs used by independent commercial pricing services, such as benchmark yields and credit risk adjustments, are those that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. Hence, the fair value measurement of corporate loans priced by independent pricing service providers is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. In addition, there are assets held with CLO portfolios that represent senior level debt of other third party CLOs. These CLO investments are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. See description of fair value process for CLO notes below. 
 
 CLO notes : The CLO notes are backed by diversified loan portfolios consisting primarily of senior secured floating rate leveraged loans. Repayment risk is segmented into tranches with credit ratings of these tranches reflecting both the credit quality of underlying collateral as well as how much protection a given tranche is afforded by tranches that are subordinate to it. The most subordinated tranche bears the first loss and receives the residual payments, if any. The interest rates are generally variable rates based on SOFR or EURIBOR plus a pre-defined spread, which varies from for the more senior tranches to for the more subordinated tranches. CLO notes mature in 2034 and 2036, and have a weighted average maturity of years as of September 30, 2024. The investors in this debt are not affiliated with the Company and have no recourse to the general credit of the Company for this debt. 
 
 The fair values of the CLO notes are measured based on the fair value of the CLO's corporate loans, as the Company uses the measurement alternative available under ASU 2014-13 and determined that the inputs for measuring financial assets are more observable. The CLO notes are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, consistent with the classification of the majority of the CLO financial assets. 
 
 The Company reviews the detailed prices including comparisons to prior periods for reasonableness. The Company utilizes a formal pricing challenge process to request a review of any price during which time the vendor examines its assumptions and relevant market inputs to determine if a price change is warranted. 
 
 The following narrative indicates the sensitivity of inputs: 
 
 Default Rate: An increase (decrease) in the expected default rate would likely increase (decrease) the discount margin (increase risk premium) used to value the CLO investments and CLO notes and, as a result, would potentially decrease the value of the CLO investments and CLO notes. 
 Recovery Rate: A decrease (increase) in the expected recovery of defaulted assets would potentially decrease (increase) the valuation of CLO investments and CLO notes. 
 Prepayment Rate: A decrease (increase) in the expected rate of collateral prepayments would potentially decrease (increase) the valuation of CLO investments and CLO notes as the expected weighted average life ("WAL") would increase (decrease).

Because the Company was no longer deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIEs, it no longer had a controlling financial interest in the entities. For deconsolidated investment entities, the Company continues to serve as the general partner and/or investment manager until such entities are fully liquidated. 
 
 Nonconsolidated VIEs 
 
 The Company also holds variable interest in certain CLOs and LPs that are not consolidated as it has been determined that the Company is not the primary beneficiary.

 Securitizations 
 
 The Company invests in various tranches of securitization entities, including RMBS, CMBS and ABS. Through its investments, the Company is not obligated to provide any financial or other support to these entities. Each of the RMBS, CMBS and ABS entities are thinly capitalized by design and considered VIEs. The Company's involvement with these entities is limited to that of a passive investor. The Company has no unilateral right to appoint or remove the servicer, special servicer or investment manager, which are generally viewed to have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the securitization entities' economic performance, in any of these entities, nor does the Company function in any of these roles. The Company, through its investments or other arrangements, does not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the entity. Therefore, the Company is not the primary beneficiary and does not consolidate any of the RMBS, CMBS and ABS entities in which it holds investments. These investments are accounted for as investments available-for-sale as described in the Fair Value Measurements (excluding Consolidated Investment Entities) Note to these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and unrealized capital gains (losses) on these securities are recorded directly in AOCI, except for certain RMBS which are accounted for under the FVO whose change in fair value is reflected in Net gains (losses) in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company s maximum exposure to loss on these structured investments is limited to the amount of its investment. Refer to the Investments (excluding Consolidated Investment Entities) Note to these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding the carrying amounts and classifications of these assets.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 For the purposes of this discussion, the terms "Voya," "the Company," "we," "our," and "us" refer to Voya Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
 
 The following discussion and analysis presents a review of our consolidated results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and financial condition as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. This item should be read in its entirety and in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes contained in Part I, Item 1. of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD A") section contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K . 
 
 In addition to historical data, this discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business, operations and financial performance based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. See the Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements. 

Overview 
 
 We are a leading provider of workplace benefits and savings solutions and technologies to U.S. employers, enabling better financial outcomes for their employees and for those who depend on their employees through our retirement solutions, retail wealth services, and comprehensive portfolio of benefits products. We are also a leading international asset manager, built on a foundation of institutional-quality fixed income and private asset strategies, with a well-established presence in U.S. markets and a large and growing business managing retail and institutional equity, fixed income, and blended strategies for clients in Europe and Asia. 
 
 Since Voya s IPO in 2013, we have evolved through the divestiture of substantially all of our closed block variable annuity, life insurance and legacy non-retirement annuity businesses and related assets. These divestitures align with our strategic focus on higher-return, capital-light businesses, while maximizing the capital returned to our shareholders. 
 
 We are focused on executing our mission to make a secure financial future possible one person, one family and one institution at a time. Voya s scale, business mix, risk profile, and strong free cash flow generation are competitive differentiators, and we have a clear path to Adjusted Operating Earnings Per Share growth via net revenue growth, margin expansion, and disciplined capital management. We provide our products and services principally through our Workplace Solutions business, which encompasses both our Wealth Solutions and Health Solutions business segments, and through our Investment Management segment. 
 
 Wealth Solutions 
 Our Wealth Solutions segment provides retirement plan solutions and administration technology and services to employers. These products and services include full-service and recordkeeping-only defined contribution plan administration, stable value and fixed general account investment products and non-qualified plan administration. It also includes tools, guidance, and services to promote the financial well-being and retirement security of employees. Additionally, we provide individual retirement accounts and financial guidance and advisory services that enables us to deepen relationships with our retirement plan participants. 
 
 Our Wealth Solutions segment earns revenue from a diverse and complementary business mix, primarily fee income from asset based and participant based administrative, recordkeeping and advisory fees as well as investment income on our general account assets and other funds. Because a significant portion of our revenues are tied to account values, our profitability is determined in part by the amount of assets we have under management, administration or advisement, which in turn depends on sales volumes to new and existing clients, net deposits from retirement plan participants, and changes in the market value of account assets. Our profitability also depends on the difference between the investment income we earn on our general account assets, or our portfolio yield, and crediting rates on client accounts. 
 
 Health Solutions 
 Our Health Solutions segment provides worksite employee benefits, Health Account Solutions (Health Savings Account ("HSA")/Flexible Spending Account ("FSA")/Health Reimbursement Arrangements ("HRA") and COBRA administration), leave management, financial wellness and decision support products and services to mid-size and large corporate employers and professional associations as well as benefits administration. In addition, our Health Solutions segment provides stop-loss coverage to employer plan sponsors that self-fund their pharmaceutical and medical benefits. 
 71 

Table of Contents 

 Our Health Solutions segment generates revenue from premiums and fees, investment income, mortality and morbidity income and policy and other charges. Underwriting income comprises the majority of revenues in this segment and derives from the difference between premiums and mortality charges collected and benefits and expenses paid for group life, stop loss and voluntary benefits. Fee income is generated from margin on expenses for services provided on benefits administration, leave management, HSA/FSA/HRA and COBRA administration and proprietary decision support tools. Investment income is driven by the spread between investment yields and credited rates (the interest and income that is credited to the policies) to policyholders on voluntary universal life, whole life products, and HSA invested assets. 
 
 Investment Management 
 Our Investment Management segment serves both individual and institutional customers, offering them domestic and international fixed income, equity, multi-asset and alternative investment products and solutions across a range of geographies, investment styles and capitalization spectrums. We aim to provide positive investment results that are repeatable and consistent, and deliver research-driven, risk-adjusted, client-oriented investment strategies and solutions and advisory services. 
 
 Through our institutional distribution channel and our Workplace Solutions business, we serve a variety of institutional clients, including public, corporate and multiemployer defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans, endowments and foundations, and insurance companies. We are a market leader in providing third-party general account management services to insurance companies, with a focus on public and private fixed income asset strategies, and a client service model adapted for the particular needs of insurance company clients. We also serve individual investors by offering our mutual funds, separately managed accounts, and private and alternative funds through an intermediary-focused distribution platform or through affiliate and third-party retirement platforms. Our scaled and growing international retail business is conducted through sub-advisory agreements with investment vehicles sponsored by affiliates and distributed in Europe and Asia. 
 
 Our Investment Management segment generates revenue through the collection of management fees on the assets we manage. These fees are typically based upon a percentage of AUM. In certain investment management fee arrangements, we may also receive performance-based incentive fees when the return on AUM exceeds certain benchmark returns or other performance hurdles. In addition, and to a lesser extent, Investment Management collects administrative fees on outside managed assets that are administered by our mutual fund platform and distributed primarily by our Wealth Solutions segment. Investment Management also receives fees as the primary investment manager of our general account, which is managed on a market-based pricing basis. Finally, Investment Management generates revenues from a portfolio of seed capital investments, collateralized loan obligations and various funds. 
 
 Business Update 
 
 On September 11, 2024, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire the full-service retirement plan business of OneAmerica Financial. This acquisition will be accomplished through the purchase of legal entities and an indemnity reinsurance agreement. The acquisition adds scale and a broader set of capabilities to our full-service business in Wealth Solutions, including incremental assets in attractive emerging and mid-market segments, employee stock ownership plan capabilities and new opportunities for distribution partnerships. The transaction, subject to customary closing conditions, is expected to close on January 1, 2025. The purchase consideration includes approximately 50 million in cash to be paid at closing and contingent consideration of up to 160 million based on plan persistency and transition incentives. 
 
 On August 1, 2023, we acquired all remaining equity interest in VFI SLK Global Services Private Limited previously held by SLK Software Private Limited ("SLK") and renamed the entity as Voya Global Services Private Limited ("Voya India"). Voya India was a private limited company in India formed pursuant to a joint venture agreement between us and SLK on August 1, 2019, with us and SLK holding 49 and 51 of ownership shares, respectively. The purpose of Voya India is to provide technology and business operation services to us. As a result of the acquisition, Voya India has become a wholly owned subsidiary of us and provides us with improved strategic and operational flexibility. As part of the purchase consideration, an upfront payment of approximately 53 million was made at closing. Net assets acquired as part of this transaction included goodwill of 102 million. 
 
 On January 24, 2023, we completed the acquisition of Benefitfocus, Inc. ("Benefitfocus"), an industry-leading benefits administration technology company that serves U.S. employers, health plans and brokers for a total purchase price consideration of 595 million. The acquisition has expanded the Company s capacity to meet the growing demand for comprehensive benefits and savings solutions and increases its ability to deliver innovative solutions for employers and health plans.

 higher impairments incurred in the prior period; and 
 gains recorded in the current period on bond sales. 
 
 Other revenue increased 22 million from 81 million to 103 million primarily due to:

 The increase was partially offset by: 
 
 a smaller unfavorable impact from the annual assumption update recorded in businesses exited; and 
 lower interest credited in Wealth Solutions primarily due to lower spread-based assets, partially offset by a higher crediting rate.

 Consolidated - Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Adjustments to Income (loss) before income taxes 
 
 Net investment gains (losses) changed 75 million from a gain of 42 million to a loss of 33 million primarily due to: 
 
 net unfavorable changes in derivative valuations due to interest rate movements; and 
 the absence of a gain recognized in the prior period from the revaluation of the investment in Voya India. 
 
 The change was partially offset by: 
 
 a favorable change in mark-to-market adjustments on securities subject to fair value option accounting primarily due to interest rate movements; 
 higher impairments incurred in the prior period; and 
 gains recorded in the current period on bond sales. 
 
 Income (loss) related to businesses exited or to be exited through reinsurance or divestment improved 16 million from a loss of 68 million to a loss of 52 million primarily due to: 
 
 a smaller unfavorable impact from the annual assumption update. 
 
 The improvement was partially offset by: 
 
 an unfavorable change in the fair value of an embedded derivative due to changes in interest rates.

 The change was partially offset by: 
 
 the absence of a gain recognized in the prior period from the revaluation of the investment in Voya India; and 
 net unfavorable changes in derivative valuations due to interest rate movements. 
 
 Other adjustments to operating earnings improved 87 million from a loss of 150 million to a loss of 63 million primarily due to: 
 
 the absence of closing costs incurred in the prior period associated with the acquisition of Benefitfocus; 
 lower integration costs associated with the Allianz GI and Benefitfocus businesses; 
 the absence of an impairment recorded in the prior period related to a vacated leased building; and 
 a loss on debt extinguishment incurred in the prior period.

 Alternative Investment Income 
 
 Investment income on certain alternative investments can be volatile due to changes in market conditions. The following table presents the amount of investment income (loss) on certain alternative investments that is included in segment Adjusted operating earnings before income taxes and the average level of assets in each segment, prior to intercompany eliminations, which excludes alternative investments and income that are a component of Income (loss) related to businesses exited or to be exited through reinsurance or divestment. These alternative investments are carried at fair value, which is estimated based on the net asset value ("NAV") of these funds. While investment income on these assets can be volatile, based on current plans, we expect to earn 9 on these assets over the long term.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Liquidity refers to our ability to access sufficient sources of cash to meet the requirements of our operating, investing and financing activities. Capital refers to our long-term financial resources available to support business operations and future growth. Our ability to generate and maintain sufficient liquidity and capital depends on the profitability of the businesses, timing of cash flows on investments and products, general economic conditions and access to the capital markets and the other sources of liquidity and capital described herein. 
 
 The following presents a review of our sources and uses of liquidity and capital and should be read in its entirety and in conjunction with the Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements discussion included further below. 
 
 Consolidated Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital 
 
 Our principal available sources of liquidity are product charges, investment income, proceeds from the maturity and sale of investments, proceeds from debt issuance and borrowing facilities, equity securities issuance, repurchase agreements, contract deposits and securities lending. Primary uses of these funds are payments of policyholder benefits, commissions and operating expenses, interest credits, dividends, debt maturities and redemptions, share repurchases, investment purchases, business acquisitions and contract maturities, withdrawals and surrenders. 
 
 Parent Company Sources and Uses of Liquidity 
 
 Voya Financial, Inc. is largely dependent on cash flows from its operating subsidiaries to meet its obligations. The principal sources of funds available to Voya Financial, Inc. include dividends and returns of capital from its operating subsidiaries, as well as cash and short-term investments, and proceeds from debt issuances, borrowing facilities and equity securities issuances. 
 
 These sources of funds include the 500 million revolving credit sublimit of our senior unsecured credit facility and reciprocal borrowing facilities maintained with Voya Financial, Inc.'s subsidiaries as well as alternate sources of liquidity described below.

 We estimate that our excess capital (which we define as the amount of total adjusted capital in our insurance subsidiaries above our 375 RBC target, plus the amount of holding company liquidity above our 200 million target) as of September 30, 2024, was approximately 0.4 billion. As of September 30, 2024, our estimated combined RBC ratio, with adjustments for certain intercompany transactions, was 395 . Both excess capital and the estimated combined RBC ratio are adjusted for the anticipated payment of the 3.976 Senior Notes maturing February 15, 2025. See the Financing Agreements Note to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1. of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional details on the maturing debt.

 Liquidity 
 
 We manage liquidity through access to substantial investment portfolios as well as a variety of other sources of liquidity including committed credit facilities, securities lending and repurchase agreements. Our asset-liability management ("ALM") process takes into account the expected maturity of investments and expected benefit payments as well as the specific nature and risk profile of the liabilities. As part of our liquidity management process, we model different scenarios to determine whether existing assets are adequate to meet projected cash flows. 
 
 Capitalization 
 
 The primary components of our capital structure consist of debt and equity securities. Our capital position is supported by cash flows within our operating subsidiaries, the availability of borrowed funds under liquidity facilities, and any additional capital we raise to invest in the growth of the business and for general corporate purposes. We manage our capital position based on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, our financial strength, the credit rating of Voya Financial, Inc. and of its insurance company subsidiaries and general macroeconomic conditions. We may repurchase or otherwise retire our debt and preferred stock and take other steps to reduce our debt and preferred stock or otherwise improve our financial position. These actions could include open market repurchases, negotiated repurchases, tender offers or other retirements of outstanding debt and opportunistic refinancing of debt. The amount that may be repurchased or otherwise retired, if any, will depend on market conditions, trading levels, cash position, compliance with covenants and other considerations.

 Voya Financial, Inc. Credit Support of Subsidiaries 
 
 Voya Financial, Inc. provide guarantees to certain of our subsidiaries to support various business requirements: 
 Voya Financial, Inc. guarantees the obligations of Voya Holdings under the 13 million principal amount of Equitable Notes maturing in 2027, and provides a back-to-back guarantee to ING Group in respect of its guarantee of 218 million combined principal amount of Aetna Notes. 
 Voya Financial, Inc. and Voya Holdings provide a guarantee of payment of obligations to certain subsidiaries under certain surplus notes held by those subsidiaries. 
 
 We did not recognize any asset or liability as of September 30, 2024 in relation to intercompany indemnifications, guarantees or support agreements. As of September 30, 2024, no guarantees existed in which we were required to currently perform under these arrangements. 
 
 Borrowings from Subsidiaries 
 
 We maintain revolving reciprocal loan agreements with a number of our life and non-life insurance subsidiaries that are used to fund short-term cash requirements that arise in the ordinary course of business. Under these agreements, either party may borrow up to the maximum allowable under the agreement for a term not more than 270 days. For life insurance subsidiaries, the amounts that either party may borrow under the agreement vary and are between 3 and 5 of the insurance subsidiary's statutory net admitted assets (excluding separate accounts) as of the previous year end depending on the state of domicile. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate amount that may be borrowed or lent under agreements with life insurance subsidiaries was 1.2 billion. For non-life insurance subsidiaries, the maximum allowable under the agreement is based on the assets of the subsidiaries and their particular cash requirements. As of September 30, 2024, Voya Financial, Inc. had 195 million outstanding borrowings from subsidiaries and had loaned 572 million to its subsidiaries. 
 
 Ratings 
 
 Our access to funding and our related cost of borrowing, collateral requirements for derivative instruments and the attractiveness of certain of our products to customers are affected by our credit ratings and insurance financial strength ratings, which are periodically reviewed by the rating agencies. Financial strength ratings and credit ratings are important factors affecting public confidence in an insurer and its competitive position in marketing products. Credit ratings are also important to our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt and for the cost of such financing.

Table of Contents 

 A downgrade in our credit ratings or the credit or financial strength ratings of our rated subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. See A downgrade or a potential downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings may result in a loss of business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A. of our most current Annual Report on Form 10-K . 
 
 Financial strength ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding the financial ability of an insurance company to meet its obligations under an insurance policy. Credit ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding an entity's ability to repay its indebtedness. These ratings are not a recommendation to buy or hold any of our securities and they may be revised or revoked at any time at the sole discretion of the rating organization. 
 
 Rating agencies use an "outlook" statement for both industry sectors and individual companies. For an industry sector, a stable outlook generally implies that over the next 12 to 18 months the rating agency expects ratings to remain unchanged among companies in the sector. For a particular company, an outlook generally indicates a medium or long-term trend in credit fundamentals, which if continued, may lead to a rating change. 
 The financial strength and credit ratings of Voya Financial, Inc. and its principal subsidiaries as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are summarized in the following table.

 (2) Fitch's financial strength ratings for insurance companies range from "AAA (exceptionally strong)" to "C (distressed)." Long-term credit ratings range from "AAA (highest credit quality)," which denotes exceptionally strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitments, to "D (default)." 
 (3) Moody s financial strength ratings for insurance companies range from "Aaa (exceptional)" to "C (lowest)." Numeric modifiers are used to refer to the ranking within the group, with 1 being the highest and 3 being the lowest. These modifiers are used to indicate relative strength within a category. Long-term credit ratings range from "Aaa (highest)" to "C (default)." 
 (4) S P's financial strength ratings for insurance companies range from "AAA (extremely strong)" to "D (default)." Long-term credit ratings range from "AAA (extremely strong)" to "D (default)." 
 (5) Effective April 11, 2019, A.M. Best withdrew, at the Company s request, its financial strength ratings with respect to Voya Financial, Inc. and Voya Retirement Insurance and Annuity Company. 
 
 On September 18, 2024, Fitch upgraded Voya Financial, Inc.'s life insurance subsidiaries' Insurer Financial Strength to A+ from A, long-term issuer default rating to A- from BBB+ and senior unsecured debt to BBB+ from BBB. In conjunction with the upgrade, Fitch revised its outlook to Stable. 
 
 In December of 2023, Moody s confirmed its outlook for the U.S. life insurance sector as stable. In November 2023, Fitch changed its outlook from neutral to improving for the North American life insurance sector. Also, in April 2024, A.M. Best maintained a stable outlook on the U.S. life insurance and annuities sector. 
 
 Restrictions on Dividends and Returns of Capital from Subsidiaries 
 
 Our business is conducted through operating subsidiaries. U.S. insurance laws and regulations regulate the payment of dividends and other distributions by our U.S. insurance subsidiaries to their respective parents. These restrictions are based in part on the prior year's statutory income and surplus. In general, dividends up to specified levels are considered ordinary and may be paid without prior approval. Dividends in larger amounts, or "extraordinary" dividends, are subject to approval by the insurance commissioner of the state of domicile of the insurance subsidiary proposing to pay the dividend. In addition, under the insurance laws of our principal insurance subsidiaries domiciled in Connecticut and Minnesota (these insurance subsidiaries are referred to collectively as our "Principal Insurance Subsidiaries"), no dividend or other distribution exceeding an amount equal to an insurance company's earned surplus may be paid without the domiciliary insurance regulator's prior approval. 
 91 

Table of Contents 

 Our Principal Insurance Subsidiaries domiciled in Connecticut and Minnesota both have ordinary dividend capacity for 2024. Any extraordinary dividend payment would be subject to domiciliary insurance regulatory approval, which can be granted or withheld at the discretion of the regulator. 
 
 We may receive dividends from or contribute capital to our wholly owned non-life insurance subsidiaries such as broker-dealers, investment management entities and intermediate holding companies.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 We have obligations for the return of non-cash collateral under an amendment to our securities lending program. Non-cash collateral received in connection with the securities lending program may not be sold or re-pledged by our lending agent, except in the event of default, and is not reflected on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. For information regarding obligations under this program, see the Investments (excluding Consolidated Investment Entities) Note in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1. of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 Leverage Ratios 
 
 Our Leverage Ratios are a measure that we use to monitor the level of our debt relative to our total capitalization. The following table presents our leverage ratios for the periods indicated:

 (4) Includes Total Financial Obligations, Mezzanine Equity, and Total Shareholders' Equity excluding AOCI. 
 (5) Total Financial Debt divided by Capitalization. 
 (6) Total Financial Obligations and Preferred equity divided by Adjusted Capitalization excluding AOCI. 
 
 Our Financial Leverage Ratio, excluding AOCI, increased from 27.8 at December 31, 2023 to 30.6 at September 30, 2024. This temporary increase was primarily due to the issuance on September 20, 2024 of 400 million of unsecured 5.0 Senior Notes due 2034. The Company expects the ratio to decrease upon repayment at maturity of the 400 million outstanding principal amount of 3.976 Senior Notes due February 15, 2025, using the proceeds of the recent issuance. 

Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Critical estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an on-going basis based on historical developments, market conditions, industry trends and other information that is reasonable under the circumstances. There can be no assurance that actual results will conform to estimates and assumptions and that reported results of operations will not be materially affected by the need to make future accounting adjustments to reflect changes in these estimates and assumptions from time to time. Those estimates are inherently subject to change and actual results could differ from those estimates, and the differences may be material to the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 We have identified the following accounting judgments and estimates as critical in that they involve a higher degree of judgment and are subject to a significant degree of variability: 
 Reserves for future policy benefits; 
 Valuation of investments and derivatives; 
 93 

Table of Contents 

 Investment impairments; 
 Goodwill and other intangible assets; 
 Income taxes; 
 Contingencies; and 
 Employee benefit plans. 
 
 In developing these accounting estimates, we make subjective and complex judgments that are inherently uncertain and subject to material changes as facts and circumstances develop. Although variability is inherent in these estimates, we believe that the amounts provided are appropriate based on the facts available upon preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 The above critical accounting estimates are described in the Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies Note in our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K . 
 
 Reserves for Future Policy Benefits 
 
 Assumptions and Periodic Review 
 
 Long-duration contracts are insurance contracts that provide insurance coverage and remain in force for an extended period. Principal assumptions used to establish the liability for future policy benefits of long-duration contracts include mortality, morbidity, policy lapse, contract renewal, payment of subsequent premiums or deposits by the contract owner, retirement, inflation, and benefit utilization. Other than interest rate assumptions, these assumptions are based on our experience and periodically reviewed against industry standards. The assumptions used require considerable judgments. Interest rates used to calculate these reserves are based on an upper-medium grade (low-credit-risk) fixed-income instrument yield derived from observable market data. Changes in, or deviations from, assumptions used can significantly affect our reserve levels and related results of operations. Assumptions are management's best estimates of future outcomes. We review these assumptions at least annually against actual experience and, based on additional information that becomes available, update them if necessary. 
 
 For the third quarter of 2024, the impact of annual assumption updates was 6 million unfavorable, of which 16 million was a favorable impact to Adjusted operating earnings before income taxes. The favorable remeasurement impact within Adjusted operating earnings was primarily related to Group Life products in the Health Solutions segment, driven by favorable mortality experience. For the third quarter of 2023, the impact of annual assumption updates was 67 million unfavorable, of which 8 million was an unfavorable impact to Adjusted operating earnings before income taxes. The unfavorable remeasurement impact within Adjusted operating earnings was related to Group and Voluntary products in the Health Solutions segment, primarily driven by unfavorable mortality experience. The total impact from assumption changes is reflected in Interest credited to contract owner account balances, Policyholder benefits or Net gains (losses) in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. For more information on the impact of annual assumption updates related to businesses exited, see Results of Operations - Consolidated in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part I, Item 2. of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Sensitivity 
 
 We perform sensitivity analyses to assess the impact that certain assumptions have on traditional reserves. The following table presents the estimated instantaneous net impact to income from continuing operations of various assumption changes on our reserves for future policy benefits and reinsurance. The effects are not representative of the aggregate impacts that could result if a combination of such changes to equity markets, interest rates and other assumptions occurred. 
 in millions) As of September 30, 2024 An assumed increase in future mortality by 1 (1.6) An assumed increase in future morbidity by 1 (0.4) An assumed increase in future persistency by 1 (0.4) 
 
 Increased assumed future mortality, morbidity, or persistency generally increases future policy benefits, thus decreasing income before income taxes.

 Income Taxes 
 
 In August 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which includes a 15 corporate alternative minimum tax ("CAMT"). The CAMT is effective in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. In September 2024, the Department of Treasury issued proposed regulations providing additional guidance on the CAMT. Based on the proposed regulations, we do not expect to be subject to the CAMT for 2024.

 Fixed maturities rated BB and below may have speculative characteristics and changes in economic conditions or other circumstances that are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the issuer to make principal and interest payments than is the case with higher rated fixed maturities.

 (1) Net gains (losses) also include derivatives interest settlements, mark to market adjustments and realized gains (losses) on standalone derivatives contracts that are in the CMO-B portfolio. 
 
 In defining the Adjusted operating earnings before income taxes for our CMO-B portfolio (including CMO-B portfolio income (loss) related to businesses to be exited through reinsurance or divestment) certain recharacterizations are recognized. The net coupon settlement on interest rate swaps hedging CMO-B securities that is included in Net gains (losses) is reflected. In addition, the premium amortization and change in fair value for securities designated under the FVO are included in Net gains (losses), whereas the coupon for these securities is included in Net investment income. In order to present the economics of these fair value securities in a similar manner to those of an available for sale security, the premium amortization is reclassified from Net gains (losses). 
 
 After adjusting for the two items referenced immediately above, the following table presents a reconciliation of Income (loss) before income taxes from our CMO-B portfolio to Adjusted operating earnings before income taxes from our CMO-B portfolio for the periods indicated:

 Mortgage Loans on Real Estate 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our mortgage loans on real estate portfolio had a weighted average DSC of 2.00 times and a weighted average LTV ratio of 43.5 . As of December 31, 2023, our mortgage loans on real estate portfolio had a weighted average DSC of 1.94 times, and a weighted average LTV ratio of 45.0 . See the Investments (excluding Consolidated Investment Entities) Note to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1. of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information on mortgage loans on real estate. 
 
 Impairments 
 
 We evaluate available-for-sale fixed maturities for impairment on a regular basis. The assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on a case-by-case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in estimated fair value. See the Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies Note in our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the policy used to evaluate whether the investments are impaired. See the Investments (excluding Consolidated Investment Entities) Note to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1. of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information on impairment. 
 
 Derivatives 
 
 We use derivatives for a variety of hedging purposes. We also have embedded derivatives within fixed maturities instruments and certain product features. See the Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies Note in our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. See the

 Derivative Financial Instruments Note to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1. of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information on derivatives. 
 
 European Exposures 
 
 We quantify and allocate our exposure to the region by attempting to identify aspects of the region or country risk to which we are exposed. Among the factors we consider are the nationality of the issuer, the nationality of the issuer's ultimate parent, the corporate and economic relationship between the issuer and its parent, as well as the political, legal and economic environment in which each functions. By undertaking this assessment, we believe that we develop a more accurate assessment of the actual geographic risk, with a more integrated understanding of contributing factors to the full risk profile of the issuer. 
 
 In the normal course of our ongoing risk and portfolio management process, we closely monitor compliance with a credit limit hierarchy designed to minimize overly concentrated risk exposures by geography, sector and issuer. This framework takes into account various factors such as internal and external ratings, capital efficiency and liquidity and is overseen by a combination of Investment and Corporate Risk Management, as well as insurance portfolio managers focused specifically on managing the investment risk embedded in our portfolio. 
 
 While economic conditions in Europe have broadly improved, geopolitical tensions emanating from the Russia-Ukraine conflict remain a notable tail risk. Despite signs of economic improvement in the region, we continue to closely monitor our exposure to the region. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our total European exposure had an amortized cost and fair value of 2,538 million and 2,439 million, respectively. Some of the major country level exposures were in the United Kingdom of 944 million, in France of 264 million, in The Netherlands of 264 million, in Switzerland of 82 million, in Germany of 175 million, in Ireland of 204 million, and in Belgium of 59 million. Our direct exposure in Eastern Europe is comparatively small, with less than 1 million of exposure in Russia and none in Ukraine or Belarus. 

Consolidated and Nonconsolidated Investment Entities 
 
 We use many forms of entities to achieve our business objectives and we have participated in varying degrees in the design and formation of these entities. These entities are considered to be VIEs or VOEs (collectively, "Consolidated Investment Entities"), or nonconsolidated VIEs, and we evaluate our involvement with each entity to determine whether consolidation is required. 
 
 We perform a quarterly consolidation analysis to assess if the consolidation of a fund is required. The consolidation process brings on the assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interest and operations of the VIE and/or VOE into our financial statements. 
 
 If the fund no longer meets the criteria for consolidation, the assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interest and operations of the fund is removed from our financial statements. This process of consolidation/deconsolidation could have a material impact on Total shareholders equity. 
 
 See Consolidation and Noncontrolling Interests and Fair Value Measurements in the Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies Note to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K . Additionally, see the Consolidated and Nonconsolidated Investment Entities Note to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1. of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information. 
 
 Securitizations 
 
 We invest in various tranches of securitization entities, including RMBS, CMBS and ABS. Refer to the Consolidated and Nonconsolidated Investment Entities Note and Fair Value Measurements (excluding Consolidated Investment Entities) Note to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1. of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for an understanding over the Company's Securitizations. Refer to the Investments (excluding Consolidated Investment Entities) Note to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1. of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for details regarding the carrying amounts and classifications of these assets. 

Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities 
 
 Voya Financial, Inc. (the "Parent Issuer") has issued certain notes pursuant to transactions registered under the Securities Act of 1933. As of September 30, 2024, such securities consist of (i) the 3.976 senior notes due 2025, the 3.65 senior notes due 
 102 

Table of Contents 

 2026, the 5.0 senior notes due 2034, the 5.7 senior notes due 2043, and the 4.8 senior notes due 2046, with an aggregate principal amount of 1.9 billion (collectively, the "Senior Notes") and (ii) the 4.7 fixed-to-floating junior subordinated notes due 2048, with principal amount of 336 million (the "Junior Subordinated Notes" and, together with the Senior Notes, the "Registered Notes"). As of December 31, 2023, such securities consist of (i) the 3.976 senior notes due 2025, the 3.65 senior notes due 2026, the 5.7 senior notes due 2043, and the 4.8 senior notes due 2046, with an aggregate principal amount of 1.5 billion and (ii) the 4.7 fixed-to-floating junior subordinated notes due 2048, with principal amount of 336 million. 
 
 Voya Holdings, Inc. (the "Subsidiary Guarantor"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent Issuer, has guaranteed each of the Registered Notes on a full and unconditional basis. No other subsidiary of the Parent Issuer has guaranteed any of the Registered Notes. The Parent Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantor are hereby referred to below as the "Obligor Group." 
 
 The full and unconditional guarantees require the Subsidiary Guarantor to satisfy the obligations of the guaranteed security immediately, if and when the Parent Issuer has failed to make a scheduled payment thereunder. If the Subsidiary Guarantor does not make such payment, any holder of the guaranteed security may immediately bring suit directly against the Subsidiary Guarantor for payment of amounts due and payable. 
 
 Set forth below is summarized financial information of the Obligor Group, as presented on a combined basis. Inter-combination transactions and balances within the Obligor Group have been eliminated. In addition, financial information of any non-issuer or non-guarantor subsidiaries, which would normally be consolidated by either the Parent Issuer or the Subsidiary Guarantor under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, has been excluded from such presentation.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Market risk is the risk that our consolidated financial position and results of operations will be affected by fluctuations in the value of financial instruments. We have significant holdings in financial instruments and are naturally exposed to a variety of market risks. The main market risks we are exposed to include interest rate risk, equity market price risk and credit risk. We do not have material market risk exposure to "trading" activities in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. For further details on these market risks, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in Part II, Item 7A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K . 
 
 Market Risk Related to Interest Rates 
 
 We assess interest rate exposures for financial assets, liabilities and derivatives using hypothetical test scenarios that assume either increasing or decreasing 100 basis point parallel shifts in the yield curve. In calculating these amounts, we exclude gains and losses on separate account fixed income securities related to products for which the investment risk is borne primarily by the separate account contract holder rather than by us. While the test scenarios are for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect our expectations regarding future interest rates or the performance of fixed income markets, they are near-term, reasonably possible hypothetical changes that illustrate the potential impact of such events. These tests do not measure the change in value that could result from non-parallel shifts in the yield curve. As a result, the actual change in fair value from a 100 basis point change in interest rates could be different from that indicated by these calculations. 
 
 The following table summarizes the net estimated potential change in fair value from hypothetical 100 basis point upward and downward shifts in interest rates as of September 30, 2024: 
 As of September 30, 2024 Hypothetical Change in

 (3) Certain amounts included in the Funding agreements without fixed maturities and deferred annuities section are also reflected within the Stabilizer and MCGs section of the table above. 
 
 Market Risk Related to Equity Market Prices 
 
 We assess equity risk exposures for financial assets, liabilities and derivatives using hypothetical test scenarios that assume either an increase or decrease of 10 in all equity market benchmark levels. In calculating these amounts, we exclude gains and losses on separate account equity securities related to products for which the investment risk is borne primarily by the separate account contract holder rather than by us. While the test scenarios are for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect our 
 104 

Table of Contents 

 expectations regarding the future performance of equity markets, they are near-term, reasonably possible hypothetical changes that illustrate the potential impact of such events. These scenarios consider only the direct effect on fair value of declines in equity benchmark market levels and not changes in asset-based fees recognized as revenue or changes in any other assumptions such as market volatility or mortality, utilization or persistency rates in insurance contracts. In addition, these scenarios do not reflect the effect of basis risk, such as potential differences in the performance of the investment funds underlying the variable annuity products relative to the equity market benchmark we use as a basis for developing our hedging strategy. The impact of basis risk could result in larger differences between the change in fair value of the equity-based derivatives and the related living benefit features, in comparison to the hypothetical test scenarios. 
 
 The following table summarizes the net estimated potential change in fair value from an instantaneous increase and decrease in all equity market benchmark levels of 10 as of September 30, 2024:

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended " Exchange Act")) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's current disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that material information relating to the Company required to be disclosed in the Company's periodic SEC filings is made known to them in a timely manner. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes to the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
