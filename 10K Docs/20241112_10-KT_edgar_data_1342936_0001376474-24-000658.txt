 PART I 
 Item 1. Business 
 
 General Overview 
 
 Rivulet Entertainment, Inc. (the "Company", "we" or "us"), is an independent studio engaged in the production, distribution and marketing of star driven commercial feature-length films, television series and mini-series, and television movies, from initial creative development through principal photography, postproduction, distribution and ancillary sales. The Company also provides music production. Upon completion of production, the Company expects to receive initial revenues from domestic and foreign distribution contracts headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona. 
 
 Effective July 9, 2024, the Company changed its fiscal year end from December 31 st to June 30 th , which is the reason this form 10-KT is being filed. Specifically, in accordance with Exchange Act Rule 13a-10, the form includes audited financial statements for the six-month transition period ended June 30, 2024, as well as unaudited financial information for the six-month comparative period ended June 30, 2023. In addition, in accordance with section 1365.2 of the Securities and Exchange Commission s the SEC Financial Reporting Manual the FRM ), the Company has included audited financial statements for the two-year period ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 As disclosed in our Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 5, 2024, the Company merged into its wholly owned subsidiary with the Company surviving and operating under its subsidiary's name. The effective date of the name change was July 12, 2024 whereby the Company's name was changed from Advanced Voice Recognition Systems, Inc. to Rivulet Entertainment, Inc. All references to the Company in this filing have been updated to reflect the name change. 
 
 In addition to the Form 8-K noted above, on March 1, 2024 the Company filed a Form 8-K to disclose that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement with Rivulet Media, Inc whereby the Company would purchase certain film production assets (from Rivulet Media) in a cash and stock deal. The acquisition was anticipated to close during April of 2024. However, the Company did not receive the requisite regulatory approval (for the acquisition) until July of 2024. In anticipation of the deal closing, the Company transferred both cash and stock to Rivulet Media during March and April of 2024. As noted above, the acquisition was formally consummated, and control was transferred upon final regulatory approval during July of 2024. Subsequent to the closing of the acquisition, the Company plans to switch its focus to the film production industry. Also, as disclosed in the Form 8-K referenced above, the distribution of shares to the legal acquiree for purposes of consummating the merger will result in the former shareholders of Rivulet Media owning approximately 88 of the combined Company. As such, the transaction led to a change in control where the former shareholders of Rivulet Media gained a controlling financial interest in the combined Company. The Company plans to recognize the transaction as a reverse merger whereby Rivulet Media will be considered the accounting acquirer/legal acquiree and Rivulet Entertainment, Inc. will be considered the accounting acquiree/legal acquirer. Further, beginning with our Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024 the historical results of the combined company will be those of Rivulet Media. 
 
 Industry Overview 
 
 The film industry, is a global business encompassing the creation, distribution, and exhibition of movies, involving various stages like development, pre-production, production, post-production, and distribution, with major players including studios, independent 
 1 
 
 producers, and streaming platforms, all working to bring films to audiences through theatrical release and other viewing platforms like streaming services; essentially, it's a multifaceted industry focused on producing and delivering visual content for entertainment purposes, generating significant revenue through box office sales and other distribution channels. 
 
 Principal Proposed Products or Services 
 
 We have not achieved any revenues from product sales. In addition, we will need substantial additional capital to achieve our marketing objectives as described below. 
 
 Rivulet Entertainment Enterprise Solutions 
 
 The independent film industry, also known as "indie cinema", is made up of films that are produced outside of the major film studio system. Independent films are known for their unique narratives, unconventional themes, and distinct storytelling methods. The Company will have lower budgets than mainstream films and are characterized by a focus on creative expression and artistic vision over commercial appeal. 
 
 RIVF patents cover both a method of implementation and a system whereby speech recognition and transcription can be operated upon and exchanged amongst users employing disparate legacy protocols through one or more transaction managers having a systems protocol. An underlying key factor in all RIVF patented technology lies in its enabling capability whereby any legacy application protocol can be made compatible with speech recognition and transcription engines with or without modification of the application or the protocol upon which the initiating or the receiving application relies. 
 
 Market 
 
 The film industry is expected to grow in the coming years, with the global market projected to reach 182.23 billion by 2031. Global Movies and Entertainment Market size was valued at over 100 billion in 2023 and is poised to grow. The independent film industry is in a healthy position, with independent box office receipts outpacing studio productions for the third year in a row. 
 
 Some other recent developments in the independent film industry include Box office revenue: in 2023 had a strong recovery. Independent films are finding success by targeting a diverse audience. Social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok can be used to build buzz around a film and engage with audiences. The availability of streaming platforms and their superior sound quality is contributing to the growth of the market. 
 
 Intellectual Property 
 
 Intellectual property (IP) refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions; literary and artistic works; designs; and symbols, names and images used in commerce. 
 
 Research and Development 
 
 We did not incur any expense for research and development activities during the six months ended June 30, 2024 or two years ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Employees 
 
 We currently have two full-time employees, Diana Jakowchuk, our Secretary and Treasurer, and Walter Geldenhuys, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. To that extent, we engage consultants and other service providers in order to help us carry out our business plan.

 Item 1C. Cybersecurity 
 
 Risk Management and Strategy 
 
 Rivulet Entertainment, Inc. recognizes the critical importance of developing, implementing, and maintaining robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard our information systems and protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data. 
 
 Managing Material Risks Integrated Overall Risk Management 
 
 Currently, the Company does not have a formalized cybersecurity risk management process. However, the organization is working toward implementing a framework for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. This includes assessing cybersecurity risk as part of an overall risk assessment and considering the likelihood and potential consequences of each risk. Plans also include the identification of critical cybersecurity risks (e.g., malware, phishing, ransomware, and unauthorized access) and the implementation of formalized mitigants to address those risks such as cybersecurity policies and incident response strategy. 
 
 Third-Party Risk 
 
 The Company does not currently engage with third parties in connection with cybersecurity risk management. Third-party consultants including cybersecurity auditors are being considered for future engagement, at which point any risks stemming from the use of third parties will be incorporated into the cybersecurity risk assessment. 
 
 Risks from Cybersecurity Threats 
 
 The Company has not encountered any cybersecurity risks or incidents that have materially impacted our business strategy, operational results, or financial condition. We remain dedicated to maintaining a strong cybersecurity position by continually analyzing and improving our security procedures to reduce potential risks. This approach to cybersecurity is critical for protecting sensitive information and guaranteeing the reliability of our business operations. 
 
 Governance 
 
 Director Oversight 
 
 Currently, Walter Geldenhuys, president and chief executive officer, is the Company s sole director. Mr. Geldenhuys is committed to effective governance in managing risks associated with cybersecurity threats because he recognizes the significance of these threats to the Company s operational integrity and stakeholder confidence. 
 
 As Mr. Geldenhuys is the sole director and the Company has minimal employees, he is made aware of relevant cybersecurity risks and related updates on an ongoing and real time basis. To that extent, there have been no critical or time sensitive cybersecurity updates thus far. 
 
 Management s Role Managing Risk 
 
 Within the management team, the responsibility for assessing and managing cybersecurity risk falls under the purview of Mr. Geldenhuys, whose background includes running a technology Company. 
 
 Monitoring Cybersecurity Incidents 
 
 As noted above, Mr. Geldenhuys is the sole Director of Rivulet Entertainment and the Company currently has a limited number of employees. As such, Mr. Geldenhuys personally monitors cybersecurity events and logs for unusual activity or potential security breaches within the network. E-mail alerts are sent in real time as notification for any suspicious activity including phishing attempts, suspicious attachments, and other e-mail-related security concerns. 
 3 

Reporting to Board of Directors 
 
 As discussed above, Mr. Geldenhuys is currently the Company s sole director. Thus, he is either aware or made aware of the Company s material risks from cybersecurity threats. To that extent, the Company is not aware of any material risks from cybersecurity events at this time. 
 
 Item 2. Properties. 
 
 Our principal executive offices are located at 7659 E. Wood Drive, Scottsdale, Arizona and are provided to us free of charge by Diana Jakowchuk, our Secretary and Treasurer. 
 
 Item 3. Legal Proceedings. 
 
 From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings or other litigation that we consider to be a part of the ordinary course of our business. Presently, we are not involved in any litigation and to the best knowledge of management, there are no legal proceedings pending or threatened against the Company.

 Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. 
 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This document contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of the Company s plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. When used in this document, the words expects , anticipates , intends and plans and similar expressions are intended to identify certain of these forward-looking statements. The cautionary statements made in this document should be read as being applicable to all related forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this document. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in this document. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 At June 30, 2024, we had current assets of 29,933,006 and current liabilities of 192,654 as compared to current assets of 480 and 138 and current liabilities of 350,196 and 343,731 as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 
 5 

Because of our history of losses, net capital deficit and lack of assurance of additional financing, the audit report on our financial statements contains a "going concern" opinion regarding doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 Our president and CEO, Walter Geldenhuys, has loaned or advanced to us funds for working capital on an "as needed" basis. There is no assurance that these loans or advances will continue in the future. At June 30, 2024 we had accrued payroll of 192,654. Further, as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we owed our officers accrued payroll of 219,677 and 162,380, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, and 2022, Walter Geldenhuys, who is our President and Chief Executive Officer, and who serves as a member of our Board of Directors advanced the Company 12,500 and 6,000, respectively. Our Secretary / Treasurer advanced the Company a total of 0 and 38,188 during the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. All of the related party loans were paid in full as of June 30, 2024. 
 
 In addition to the related party loans noted above, we have also made sales of our common stock in private transactions as follows: 
 
 During March of 2024, the Company entered into a Subscription Agreement with one private investor. Pursuant to the Subscription Agreement, the Company sold 7,500,000 shares of common stock at a purchase price of 0.40 per share for a total of 3,000,000. The funds were used to pay the Company's debts and contribute to the Acquisition costs. To that extent, the Company distributed to Rivulet Media 2,950,000 as a portion of the acquisition cost as of June 30, 2024. The Company paid no underwriting discounts or commissions. 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement for the private sale of 3,333 shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of 5,000 . On December 29, 2022, the Company entered into an Escrow agreement for the purchase of 2,625,797shares of the Company's Common Stock. The shares were in Escrow until full payment was received on April 19, 2023. and released to JJW Investments, LLC ("JJW"). On April 19, 2023, payment of 305,683 was received from JJW for the 2,625,797, shares of the Company's Common Stock representing 48 of the Company's issued and outstanding common stock. JJW purchased an additional 170,000 shares representing 3 of the Company's issued and outstanding common stock for a total of 51 of the Company. 
 
 Because of our history of losses, and lack of assurance of additional financing, the audit reports on our financial statements as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and 2022 contained a "going concern" opinion regarding doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 We will require additional debt or equity financing or a combination of both in order to carry out our business plan. We plan to raise additional funds through future sales of our securities, until such time as our revenues are sufficient to meet our cost structure, and ultimately achieve profitable operations. There is no assurance we will be successful in raising additional capital or achieving profitable operations. Our board of directors may attempt to use non-cash consideration to satisfy obligations that may consist of restricted shares of our common stock. These actions would result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing shareholders and may further dilute our common stock book value. 
 
 As discussed throughout the filing, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with Rivulet Media during March of 2024. As part of the agreement, the Company agreed i) to issue approximately 90 million shares and ii) make a 10,000,000 payment to the shareholders of Rivulet Media. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had transferred approximately 67 million shares and made a payment of approximately 3,000,000, which have been recognized as an approximately 30 million asset purchase deposit on our balance sheet. The acquisition closed during July of 2024 and will be accounted for as a reverse acquisition due to the Rivulet Media shareholders obtaining control of the combined Company. 
 
 To obtain sufficient funds to meet our future needs for capital, we will from time to time, evaluate opportunities to raise financing through some combination of the private sale of equity, or issuance of convertible debt securities. However, future equity or debt financing may not be available to us at all, or if available, may not be on terms acceptable to us. We do not intend to pay dividends to shareholders in the foreseeable future. 
 
 In order for our operations to continue, we will need to generate revenues from our intended operations sufficient to meet our anticipated cost structure. We may encounter difficulties in establishing these operations due to our inability to successfully prosecute any patent enforcement actions or our inability to effectively execute our business plan.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Board of Directors and Audit Committee of 
 Rivulet Entertainment Inc. 
 7659 East Wood Drive 
 Scottsdale, AZ 85260 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Rivulet Entertainment Inc. (the Company as of June 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the periods ended June 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and 2022 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the periods then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Substantial Doubt about the Company s ability to Continue as a Going Concern 
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2, the Company has incurred net losses and working capital deficits. These factors, and the need for additional financing in order for the Company to meet its business plans raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified with respect to that matter. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Fair Value of Consideration for Asset Purchase 
 As described in Note 7 to the Company s financial statements, the Company adheres to ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement . When the Company issued shares for the asset purchase agreement, they utilized the share price based on its most recent sale of unregistered securities. 
 We identified the Company s application of the accounting for the fair value of consideration given for the asset purchase agreement as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for our determination of this critical audit matter related to the high degree of subjectivity in the Company s judgments in determining the qualitative factors. Auditing these judgments and assumptions by the Company involves auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit evidence and effort required to address these matters. 
 The primary procedures we performed to address these critical audit matters included the following: 
 We obtained the asset purchase agreement and memo of management s accounting treatment for the transaction, and subscription agreement for unregistered sale of securities and performed the following procedures: 
 - Reviewed agreements for all relevant terms. 
 - Tested management s identification and treatment of agreement terms. 
 - Recalculated management s fair value based on the terms in the agreements. 
 - Assessed the terms and evaluated the appropriateness of management s application of their accounting policies, along with their use of estimates, in the determination of the fair value of consideration.

 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.

 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) and pursuant to Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") as of June 30, 2024. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, such as this Form 10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and is communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 
 Based on our review and evaluation, our chief executive officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. The evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures and the conclusion as to their adequacy and effectiveness, included consideration of the deficiency noted below. 
 
 We have identified, as of June 30, 2024, a lack of segregation of duties in accounting and financial reporting activities, which we believe is a material weakness. The size of our business necessarily imposes practical limitations on the effectiveness of those internal control practices and procedures that rely on the segregation of duties. 
 
 Management believes this lack of segregation of duties in accounting and financial reporting did not result in material inaccuracies or omissions of material fact and, to the best of its knowledge, believes that the financial statements for the transition period ended June 30, 2024 and two years ended December 31, 2023 fairly present in all material respects the financial condition and results of operations for the Company in conformity with US GAAP. There is, however, a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or financial statements would not have been prevented or detected as a result of this material weakness.

 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 
 
 (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 
 (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of its management and directors; and 
 (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Our management assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024. We have identified, as of June 30, 2024, a lack of segregation of duties in accounting and financial reporting activities, which we believe is a material weakness. The size of our business necessarily imposes practical limitations on the effectiveness of those internal control practices and procedures that rely on the segregation of duties. 
 
 Management believes this deficiency in internal control did not result in material inaccuracies or omissions of material fact and, to the best of its knowledge, believes that the financial statements for the transition period ended June 30, 2024 and two years ended December 31, 2023 fairly present in all material respects the financial condition and results of operations for the Company in conformity with GAAP. There is, however, a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual financial statements would not have been prevented or detected as a result of this material weakness. 
 
 The Company has already undertaken certain plans in order to remediate the material weakness. Specifically, the Company has brought in an outside consulting firm to assist with i) SEC reporting requirements and ii) segregation of duties. 
 
 This Transition Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm as we are a non-accelerated filer. 
 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 We regularly review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, consolidating activities, and migrating processes. 
 
 There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Transition Report on Form 10-K that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
