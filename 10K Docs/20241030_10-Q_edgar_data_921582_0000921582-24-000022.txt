The Company is the primary beneficiary of and consolidates of these entities as it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE, and it has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the respective VIE that could potentially be significant. The majority of the assets relating to these production companies are held by the IMAX Original Film Fund (the Original Film Fund as described in Note 16. The Company does not consolidate the other film production companies because it does not have the power to direct their activities and it does not have the obligation to absorb the majority of the expected losses or the right to receive expected residual returns. The Company uses the equity method of accounting for these entities, which are not material to the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

or more. The Company has determined that it is reasonably certain that the renewal options on its warehouse leases will be exercised based on previous history, its current understanding of future business needs, and its level of investment in leasehold improvements, among other factors. The incremental borrowing rate used in the calculation of the Company s lease liabilities is based on the location of each leased property. None of the Company s leases include options to purchase the leased property. The depreciable lives of right-of-use assets and related leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term. The Company s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. 
 
 The Company has a finance lease arrangement involving equipment used to facilitate the delivery of live events to certain IMAX locations. The lease arrangement includes an option for the Company to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term that is reasonably certain to be exercised. The resulting right-of-use assets are being depreciated from the lease commencement dates over the useful life of the underlying equipment. The incremental borrowing rate used in the calculation of the lease liabilities is based on the rate of interest the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term.

The net proceeds from the issuance of the Convertible Notes were million, after deducting the initial purchasers discounts and commissions. 
 
 The Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and bear interest at a rate of per annum on the principal of million, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on October 1, 2021. The Convertible Notes will mature on April 1, 2026, unless they are redeemed or repurchased by the Company or converted on an earlier date. 
 
 Holders of the Convertible Notes have the right to convert their Convertible Notes in certain circumstances and during specified periods. Before January 1, 2026, holders of the Convertible Notes have the right to convert their Convertible Notes only upon the occurrence of certain events. From and after January 1, 2026, holders of the Convertible Notes may convert their Convertible Notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as applicable, cash or a combination of cash (in an amount no less than the principal amount of the Convertible Notes being converted) and common shares, at its election, based on the applicable conversion rates.

In addition, calling any Convertible Notes for redemption will constitute a make-whole fundamental change with respect to such notes, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of such notes will be increased in certain circumstances if such notes are converted after they are called for redemption. 
 
 In connection with the pricing of the Convertible Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the Capped Call Transactions with certain financial institutions. The Capped Call Transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution resulting from the common shares the Company is required to issue and/or to offset any potential cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes in the event that the market price per share of the Company s common shares is greater than the strike price of the Capped Call Transactions with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. The Capped Call Transactions have an initial cap price of per share of the Company s common shares, which represents a premium of over the last reported sale price of the common shares when they were priced on March 16, 2021, and are subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions. Collectively, the Capped Call Transactions cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the Convertible Notes, the number of the Company s common shares underlying the Convertible Notes. The cost of the Capped Call Transactions was approximately million. 
 
 The Capped Call Transactions are separate transactions, are not part of the terms of the Convertible Notes and will not affect any holder s rights under the Convertible Notes. Holders of the Convertible Notes will not have any rights with respect to the Capped Call Transactions. 
 
 The Capped Call Transactions meet all of the applicable criteria for equity classification in accordance with ASC 815-10-15-74(a), Derivatives and Hedging Embedded Derivatives Certain Contracts Involving an Entity s Own Equity, and, as a result, the related million cost was recorded as a reduction to Other Equity within Shareholders Equity on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity and Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 In addition, upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined below), holders may require the Company to repurchase their Convertible Notes at a cash repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Subject to the terms and conditions of the indenture governing the Convertible Notes, a fundamental change means, among other things, an event resulting in (i) a change of control, (ii) a transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, (iii) a merger, (iv) liquidation or dissolution of the Company, or (v) delisting of the Company s common shares from a national securities exchange.

IMAX LTIP Performance Stock Units PSU Summary 
 
 The Company grants types of PSU awards, one which vests based on a combination of employee service and the achievement of certain Adjusted EBITDA targets and one which vests based on a combination of employee service and the achievement of total shareholder return TSR targets. The achievement of the Adjusted EBITDA and TSR targets in these PSUs is determined over a performance period. At the conclusion of the performance period, the number of PSUs that ultimately vest can range from to a maximum vesting opportunity of of the initial Adjusted EBITDA PSU award or of the initial TSR PSU award for awards issued in 2022 and of the initial TSR PSU award for awards issued in 2023 and thereafter, depending upon actual performance versus the established Adjusted EBITDA and TSR targets, respectively. 
 
 The grant date fair value of PSUs with Adjusted EBITDA targets is equal to the closing price of the Company s common shares on the date of grant or the average closing price of the Company s common shares for days prior to the date of grant. The grant date fair value of PSUs with TSR targets is determined on the grant date using a Monte Carlo Model. The compensation expense attributable to each type of PSU is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. 
 
 The fair value determined by the Monte Carlo Model is affected by the Company s share price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, market conditions as of the grant date, the Company s expected share price volatility over the term of the awards, and other relevant data. The compensation expense is fixed on the date of grant based on the fair value of the PSUs granted. 
 
 The amount and timing of compensation expense recognized for PSUs with Adjusted EBITDA targets is dependent upon management s assessment of the likelihood of achieving these targets. If, as a result of management s assessment, it is projected that a greater number of PSUs will vest than previously anticipated, a life-to-date adjustment to increase compensation expense is recorded in the period that such determination is made. Conversely, if, as a result of management s assessment, it is projected that a lower number of PSUs will vest than previously anticipated, a life-to-date adjustment to decrease compensation expense is recorded in the period that such determination is made. The expense recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 includes adjustments reflecting management s estimate of the number of Adjusted EBITDA PSUs expected to vest.

OVERVIEW 
 
 IMAX is a premier global technology platform for entertainment and events. Through its proprietary software, auditorium, architecture, patented intellectual property, and specialized equipment, IMAX offers a unique end-to-end solution to create superior, awe-inspiring immersive content experiences for which the IMAX brand is globally renowned. Top filmmakers, movie studios, artists, and creators utilize the cutting-edge visual and sound technology of IMAX to connect with audiences in innovative ways. As a result, IMAX is among the most important and successful global distribution platforms for domestic and international tentpole films. The Company s global content portfolio includes blockbuster films, both from Hollywood and local language film industries worldwide; IMAX documentaries, both original and acquired; and IMAX events and experiences in emerging verticals, including music, gaming, and sports. 
 
 The Company leverages its proprietary technology and engineering in all aspects of its business, which principally consists of the digital remastering of films and other content into the IMAX format for distribution across the IMAX network IMAX Film Remastering and the sale or lease of premium IMAX theater systems IMAX System(s) ). 
 
 IMAX Systems are based on proprietary and patented image, audio and other technology developed over the course of the Company s history since its founding in 1967. The customers for IMAX Systems are principally exhibitors that operate commercial multiplex theaters, and, to a much lesser extent, museums, science centers and destination entertainment sites. The Company does not own the locations in the IMAX network, except for one, and is not an exhibitor, but instead sells or leases the IMAX System to exhibitor customers along with licenses to use its trademarks and ongoing maintenance services for which there are annual payments by the exhibitors to IMAX. 
 
 IMAX has the largest global premium format network, more than double the size of its nearest competitor. As of September 30, 2024, there were 1,788 IMAX Systems in 89 countries and territories, including 1,714 commercial multiplexes, 12 commercial destinations, and 62 institutional locations in the Company s global network. This compares to 1,731 IMAX Systems in 87 countries and territories as of September 30, 2023, including 1,651 commercial multiplexes, 12 commercial destinations, and 68 institutional locations in the Company s global network. (Refer to the table under IMAX Network and Backlog for additional information on the composition of the IMAX network.) 
 
 IMAX Systems provide the Company s exhibitor customers with a combination of the following benefits: 
 
 the ability to exhibit content that has been enhanced through the IMAX Film Remastering, which results in higher image and sound fidelity than conventional cinema experiences; 
 
 advanced, high-resolution projectors with specialized equipment and automated theater control systems, which generate significantly more contrast and brightness than conventional theater systems; 
 
 large screens and proprietary auditorium geometry, which result in a substantially larger field of view so that the screen extends to the edge of a viewer s peripheral vision and creates more realistic images; 
 
 advanced sound system components, which deliver more expansive sound imagery and pinpointed origination of sound to any specific spot in an auditorium equipped with an IMAX System; 
 
 specialized theater acoustics, which result in a four-fold reduction in background noise; 
 
 ongoing maintenance and extended warranty services; and 
 
 a license to the globally recognized IMAX brand, as well as benefits from IMAX marketing of films being shown in its network and IMAX s growing social media followership.

In addition, select movies shown in the IMAX network are filmed using proprietary IMAX film cameras or IMAX certified digital cameras, which along with IMAX s customized guidance and a workflow process provide filmmakers enhanced and differentiated image quality and an IMAX-exclusive film aspect ratio that delivers up to 26 more image onto a standard IMAX movie screen. In select IMAX locations worldwide, movies filmed with IMAX cameras have an IMAX-exclusive 1.43 film aspect ratio, delivering up to 67 more image. 
 
 Together, these components cause audiences in IMAX locations to feel as if they are a part of the on-screen action, creating a more intense, immersive, and awe-inspiring exciting experience than a conventional cinematic format. 
 
 As a result of the engineering and scientific achievements that are a hallmark of The IMAX Experience , the Company s exhibitor customers typically charge a premium for films released in IMAX s format versus films exhibited in their other auditoriums. The premium pricing, combined with the higher attendance levels associated with IMAX films, generates incremental box office for the Company s exhibitor customers and for the movie studios releasing their films to the IMAX network. The incremental box office generated by IMAX films combined with IMAX s unmatched global network footprint and scale has helped establish IMAX as a key premium distribution and marketing platform for Hollywood and foreign local language movie studios. 
 
 The Company continues to evolve its platform to bring new, innovative events and experiences to audiences worldwide. The Company has a footprint of connected IMAX Systems capable of delivering live, interactive content with low latency and superior sight and sound. 
 
 As a premier global technology platform for entertainment and events, the Company strives to remain at the forefront of advancements in technology. The Company offers a suite of laser-based digital projection systems IMAX Laser Systems ), which deliver increased resolution, sharper and brighter images, deeper contrast, and the widest range of colors available to filmmakers today. The Company further believes that its suite of IMAX Laser Systems are helping facilitate the next major renewal and upgrade cycle for the global IMAX network. 
 
 The Company utilizes AI for image enhancement, streaming technology, and data analysis to improve various aspects of its business. Furthermore, the Company is actively exploring other global use cases for AI to save costs, and to improve its products, operations, and efficiency. 

SOURCES OF REVENUE 
 
 The Company has organized its operating segments into the following two reportable segments: (i) Content Solutions, which principally includes content enhancement and distribution services, and (ii) Technology Products and Services, which principally includes the sale, lease, and maintenance of IMAX Systems. The Company s activities that do not meet the criteria to be considered a reportable segment are disclosed within All Other. (See Note 13 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1). 

Content Solutions 
 
 The Content Solutions segment earns revenue principally from the digital remastering of films and other content into IMAX formats for distribution across the IMAX network. To a lesser extent, the Content Solutions segment also earns revenue from the distribution of large-format documentary films and IMAX events and experiences including music, gaming, and sports, as well as the provision of film post-production services. 
 
 Film Remastering and Distribution 
 
 IMAX Film Remastering is a proprietary technology that digitally remasters films and other content into IMAX formats for distribution across the IMAX network. In a typical IMAX Film Remastering and distribution arrangement, the Company receives a percentage of the box office receipts from a movie studio in exchange for converting a commercial film into the IMAX format and distributing it through the IMAX network. The fee earned by the Company in a typical IMAX Film Remastering and distribution arrangement averages approximately 12.5 of box office receipts (i.e., global box office GBO less applicable sales taxes), except for within Greater China, where the Company receives a lower percentage of net box office receipts for certain Hollywood films due to an import tax.

Table of Contents 

 IMAX Film Remastering digitally enhances the image resolution of films for projection on IMAX screens while maintaining or enhancing the visual clarity and sound quality to levels for which The IMAX Experience is known. In addition, the original soundtrack of a film to be exhibited across the IMAX network is remastered for IMAX digital sound systems. IMAX remastered soundtracks are uncompressed for full fidelity. IMAX sound systems use proprietary loudspeaker systems and proprietary surround sound configurations that ensure every seat in an auditorium is an optimal listening position. 
 
 IMAX films also benefit from enhancements made by individual filmmakers exclusively for the IMAX release of the film. Collectively, the Company refers to these enhancements as IMAX DNA. Filmmakers and movie studios have sought IMAX-specific enhancements in recent years to generate interest in and excitement for their films. Such enhancements include shooting films with IMAX cameras to increase the audience s immersion in the film and to take advantage of the unique dimensions of the IMAX screen by projecting the film in a larger aspect ratio that delivers up to 26 more image onto a standard IMAX movie screen. In select IMAX locations worldwide, movies filmed with IMAX cameras have an IMAX-exclusive 1.43 film aspect ratio, delivering up to 67 more image. The Company has a Filmed For IMAX program for select films under which filmmakers craft films from their inception in numerous ways to optimize The IMAX Experience . The program includes incremental and bespoke marketing support, which box office metrics demonstrate audiences respond extremely favorably to, and drives a higher market share for IMAX. 
 
 Management believes that growth in international box office remains an important driver of growth for the Company. To support continued growth in international markets, the Company is focused on the expansion of the IMAX network and has sought to elevate its international film strategy, supplementing its slate of Hollywood films with appealing local language films released in select markets, including China, Japan, India, France and South Korea. More recently, the Company has further expanded its strategy by distributing local language films in both native and foreign markets. 
 
 The following table provides detailed information about the films that were released to the Company s global network during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively:

The Company remains in active negotiations with studios for additional films to fill out its short- and long-term film slate for the IMAX network. The Company expects to continue announcing additional local language films and exclusive IMAX events and experiences to be released throughout the remainder of 2024 to its global network.

 Other Content Solutions 
 
 The Company distributes large-format documentary feature films through its global commercial network and institutional theaters.

 In addition, the Company continues to evolve its platform to bring new, innovative IMAX events and experiences to audiences worldwide. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a footprint of 265 connected locations in the IMAX network across North America, Europe, Africa, Australia and Asia configured with connectivity to deliver live and interactive events with low latency and superior sight and sound.

In addition, the Company hosted an IMAX event, Andre 3000: New Blue Sun , and entered into a partnership with A24 for a monthly one-night-only IMAX release of classic A24 titles, including Alex Garland s highly acclaimed Ex Machina , Uncut Gems , and Hereditary .

 The Company provides film post-production and quality control services for large-format films, whether produced by IMAX or third-parties, and digital post-production services. In addition, the Company also provides IMAX film and digital cameras to content creators under the IMAX certified camera program. 

Technology Products and Services 
 
 The Company works with filmmakers, studios, and artists end-to-end from content creation through content delivery. The Company provides IMAX film cameras to select IMAX and third-party productions and certifies a suite of high-end digital cameras to shoot in the IMAX format under its Filmed For IMAX program. In addition, the Company provides post-production including its proprietary DMR process and quality control services for films that are distributed across the IMAX network. 
 
 Sales and Sales-Type Lease Arrangements 
 
 The Company provides IMAX Systems to exhibitors through sale arrangements or long-term lease arrangements that for accounting purposes are classified as sales-type leases. Under these arrangements, in exchange for providing the IMAX System, the Company earns initial fees and ongoing consideration, which can include fixed annual minimum payments and contingent fees in excess of the minimum payments, as well as maintenance and extended warranty fees (see IMAX Maintenance below). The initial fees vary depending on the system configuration and location of the IMAX System. Initial fees are paid to the Company in installments typically between the time of signing the arrangement and the time of system installation. Once an IMAX System is installed, the initial fees and the present value of future annual minimum payments, which are financing fees, are recognized as revenue. In addition, in sale arrangements, the present value of the estimated contingent fees that may become due if certain annual minimum box office receipt thresholds are exceeded is recorded as revenue in the period when the sale is recognized and is adjusted in future periods based on actual results and changes in estimates. Such variable consideration is only recognized on sales transactions to the extent the Company believes there is not a risk of significant revenue reversal. Finance income is recognized over the term of a financed sale or sales-type lease arrangement. 
 
 In sale arrangements, title to the IMAX System equipment generally transfers to the customer. However, in certain instances, the Company retains title or a security interest in the equipment until the customer has made all payments required by the agreement or until certain shipment events for the equipment have occurred. In a sales-type lease arrangement, title to the IMAX System equipment remains with the Company. The Company has the right to remove the equipment for non-payment or other defaults by the customer. 
 
 The revenue earned from customers under the Company s IMAX System sale or sales-type lease agreements varies from quarter-to- quarter and year-to-year based on a number of factors, including the number and mix of IMAX System configurations sold or leased, the timing of installation of the IMAX Systems, the nature of the arrangement and other factors specific to individual contracts. 
 
 Joint Revenue Sharing Arrangements 
 
 The Company provides IMAX Systems to exhibitors through joint revenue sharing arrangements JRSA ). Under the traditional form of these arrangements, the Company provides the IMAX System under a long-term lease in which the Company assumes the majority of the equipment and installation costs. In exchange for its upfront investment, the Company, primarily, earns rent based on a percentage of contingent box office receipts rather than requiring the customer to pay a fixed upfront fee or fixed annual minimum payments. Rental payments from the customer are required throughout the term of the arrangement and are typically due either monthly or quarterly. The Company retains title to the IMAX System equipment components throughout the lease term, and the equipment is returned to the Company at the conclusion of the arrangement. 
 
 45 

Table of Contents 

 Under certain other joint revenue sharing arrangements, known as hybrid arrangements, the customer is responsible for making fixed upfront payments prior to the delivery and installation of the IMAX System in an amount that is typically half of what the Company would receive from a typical sale transaction. As with a traditional joint revenue sharing arrangement, the customer also pays the Company a percentage of contingent box office receipts over the term of the arrangement, although this percentage is typically half that of a traditional joint revenue sharing arrangement. Hybrid joint revenue sharing arrangements take the form of a sale. The fixed upfront payment is recognized when the lease term commences and is recorded within Revenues Technology Sales. The contingent rent is recognized as revenue over the lease term and is recorded within Revenues Technology Rentals. 
 
 Under most joint revenue sharing arrangements (both traditional and hybrid), the initial non-cancellable term is 10 years or longer and is renewable by the customer for one to two additional terms of between three to five years. The Company has the right to remove the equipment for non-payment or other defaults by the customer. The contracts are non-cancellable by the customer unless the Company fails to perform its obligations. 
 
 The revenue earned from customers under the Company s joint revenue sharing arrangements can vary from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year based on a number of factors that drive box office levels including film performance, the mix of IMAX System configurations, the timing of installation of IMAX Systems, the nature of the arrangement, the location, size and management of the theater and other factors specific to individual arrangements. 
 
 Joint revenue sharing arrangements also require IMAX to provide maintenance and extended warranty services to the customer over the term of the lease in exchange for a separate fixed annual fee. These fees are reported within IMAX Maintenance, as discussed below. 
 
 Joint revenue sharing arrangements have been an important factor in the expansion of the Company s commercial system network. Joint revenue sharing arrangements allow commercial theater exhibitors to install IMAX Systems without the significant initial capital investment required in a sale or sales-type lease arrangement. Joint revenue sharing arrangements drive recurring cash flows and earnings for the Company as customers under these arrangements pay the Company a portion of their ongoing box office receipts. The Company funds its investment in equipment for joint revenue sharing arrangements through cash flows from operations. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 894 locations under joint revenue sharing arrangements in its global commercial multiplex network. The Company also had contracts in backlog for 302 systems under joint revenue sharing arrangements as of September 30, 2024, including 92 upgrades to existing locations and 210 new locations. 
 
 IMAX Maintenance 
 
 IMAX System arrangements also include a requirement for the Company to provide maintenance services over the life of the arrangement in exchange for an extended warranty and annual maintenance fee paid by the exhibitor. Under these arrangements, the Company provides preventative and emergency maintenance services to ensure that each presentation is up to the highest IMAX quality standard. Annual maintenance fees are paid throughout the duration of the term of the system agreements. 

All Other 
 
 Streaming and Consumer Technology 
 
 Streaming and Consumer Technology includes the Company s Streaming Technology software offerings and IMAX Enhanced product services. Streaming Technology consists of several software products including:

 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s revenue generated from its Greater China operations represents 25 of consolidated revenue. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 808 IMAX Systems operating in Greater China with an additional 254 systems in backlog. 
 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the IMAX network generated over 114 million in box office from local language films, representing approximately 16 of the Company s total box office in the period. The Company is also seeing its local language films increasingly generate significant IMAX box office in markets outside of those in which they are released .

 (1) Includes Sales, Hybrid Sales, and Sales-Type Lease deal types. 
 (2) The consideration owed under traditional joint revenue sharing arrangements is typically a percentage of contingent box office receipts rather than a fixed upfront fee or fixed annual minimum payments. Accordingly, such arrangements do not usually have a dollar value in backlog; however, hybrid joint revenue sharing arrangements typically provide for contracted upfront payments and therefore carry a backlog value based on those payments. 
 (3) Includes 22 IMAX Systems (2023 38) where certain of the Company s contracts contain options for the customer to elect to upgrade system type or to alter the contract structure (for example, from a joint revenue sharing arrangement to a sale) after signing, but before installation. Current backlog information reflects all known elections. 

The backlog reflects the minimum number of commitments for IMAX Systems according to the signed contracts. The dollar value fluctuates depending on the number of new arrangements signed from year-to-year, which adds to backlog, and the installation and acceptance of IMAX Systems and the settlement of contracts, both of which reduce backlog. The dollar value of backlog typically represents the fixed contracted revenue according to the signed IMAX System sale and lease agreements that the Company expects to recognize as revenue upon installation and acceptance of the associated system, as well as an estimate of variable consideration in sales arrangements. The value of backlog does not include amounts allocated to maintenance and extended warranty revenues or revenue from systems in which the Company has an equity interest, operating leases, and long-term conditional theater commitments. The Company believes that the contractual obligations for IMAX System installations that are listed in backlog are valid and binding commitments. 
 
 From time to time, in the normal course of its business, the Company will have customers who are unable to proceed with an IMAX System installation for a variety of reasons, including the inability to obtain certain consents, approvals or financing. Once the determination is made that the customer will not proceed with installation, the agreement with the customer is terminated or amended. If the agreement is terminated, once the Company and the customer are released from all their future obligations under the agreement, all or a portion of the initial rents or fees that the customer previously made to the Company are recognized as revenue. 
 
 Certain of the Company s contracts contain options for the customer to elect to upgrade system type during the term or to alter the contract structure (for example, from a joint revenue sharing arrangement to a sale) after signing, but before installation. Current backlog information reflects all known elections.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The Company s business and future prospects are evaluated by Richard L. Gelfond, its Chief Executive Officer CEO ), using a variety of factors and financial and operational metrics including: (i) IMAX box office performance and the securing of new IMAX films and alternative content to be exhibited across the IMAX network; (ii) the signing, installation, and financial performance of IMAX System arrangements, particularly those involving IMAX Laser Systems; (iii) the success of the Company s investments in business evolution and brand extensions into streaming and consumer technology, and the distribution of live events to the IMAX network; (iv) revenues and gross margins earned by the Company s segments, as discussed below; (v) consolidated earnings (loss) from operations, as adjusted for unusual items; (vi) the continuing ability to invest in and improve the Company s technology to enhance the differentiation of The IMAX Experience versus other out-of-home experiences; (vii) the overall execution, reliability, and consumer acceptance of The IMAX Experience ; and (viii) short- and long-term cash flow projections. 
 
 The CEO is the Company s Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM ), as such term is defined under United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles U.S. GAAP ). The CODM assesses segment performance based on segment revenues and gross margins. Selling, general and administrative expenses, research and development costs, the amortization of intangible assets, provision for (reversal of) current expected credit losses, certain write-downs, interest income, interest expense, and income tax (expense) benefit are not allocated to the Company s segments. 
 
 The Company has organized its operating segments into the following two reportable segments: (i) Content Solutions, which principally includes content enhancement and distribution services, and (ii) Technology Products and Services, which principally includes the sale, lease, and maintenance of IMAX Systems. The Company s activities that do not meet the criteria to be considered a reportable segment are disclosed within All Other. (See Note 13 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1).

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s revenues decreased by 12.4 million, or 12 , while net income increased by 1.9 million or 16 , when compared to the same period in 2023, driven by a lower level of IMAX box office that was more than offset by decreases in costs and expenses resulting from corporate and operational initiatives and timing of expenditures, as discussed below. 

Revenues and Gross Margin 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s revenues and gross margin decreased by 12.4 million, or 12 , and 11.7 million, or 19 , respectively, when compared to same period in 2023 principally due to a lower level of IMAX box office performance driven by a less favorable mix of film content available to play across the IMAX global network, partially offset by higher IMAX Systems installed under sales arrangements. 
 
 The following table presents the Company s revenue, gross margin, and gross margin percentage by reportable segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 (1) All Other includes the results from Streaming and Consumer Technology and other ancillary activities. 

Content Solutions 
 
 Content Solutions segment results are influenced by the level of commercial success and box office performance of the films and other content released to the IMAX network, as well as other factors including the timing of the releases, the length of play across the IMAX network, the box office share take rates under the Company s Film Remastering and distribution arrangements, the level of marketing spend associated with the releases in the year, and the fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies versus the U.S. Dollar. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Content Solutions segment revenues and gross margin decreased by 14.1 million, or 32 , and decreased by 10.0 million, or 38 , respectively, when compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, box office generated by IMAX films totaled 239.5 million and represented IMAX s third highest third quarter box office of all time. The decrease of 107.6 million, or 31 , decrease versus the prior year comparative period of 347.1 million, driven in part by a less favorable mix of content globally which included fewer blockbusters, as well as a challenging compare to the prior year that included over 180 million in box office from Oppenheimer , the Company s fifth highest grossing title of all time. In the third quarter of 2024, IMAX box office was generated by the exhibition of 44 films and other content (37 new and 7 originally released in a prior year), including Deadpool Wolverine , which generated IMAX box office of over 83 million. In the third quarter of 2023, IMAX box office was generated by the exhibition of 41 films (34 new films and 7 films originally released in a prior year). 
 
 52 

Table of Contents 

 The impact on revenue from the lower box office experienced year over year was partially offset by the revenue earned from higher revenues from alternative content including A24 title release Everything, Everywhere All At Once , NBC s 2024 Paris Olympics Opening Ceremony, Korean concert film IM Hero: The Stadium , and limited release documentaries FLY: The IMAX Experience and Skywalkers: A Love Story The IMAX Experience . The Company continues to build out its alternative content strategy, including evolving its documentary strategy, as a way to increase utilization and revenues across the IMAX System footprint. 
 
 In addition to the level of revenues, Content Solutions segment gross margin is influenced by the costs associated with films and other content (documentaries, live, alternative and other) exhibited in the period. The costs associated with films and other content can include production, post-production, distribution and marketing, which are expensed as incurred. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, gross margin percent was 55 compared to 60 in the prior year period, with the decrease being driven primarily by a lower level of IMAX box office year over year. 
 
 Technology Products and Services 
 
 The primary drivers of Technology Products and Services segment results are the number of IMAX Systems installed in a period, the costs associated with each installation, lease payments tied to the box office performance of the films released to the IMAX network, as well as the associated maintenance contracts that accompany each installation. The average revenue and gross margin per IMAX System under sale and sales-type lease arrangements vary depending upon the number of IMAX System commitments with a single respective exhibitor, an exhibitor s location, the type of system sold, and various other factors. The installation of IMAX Systems in theaters or multiplexes, which make up a large portion of the Company s system backlog, depends primarily on the timing of the construction of those projects, which is not under the Company s control. 
 
 The following table provides information about IMAX Systems installed and the associated revenue recognized at that time, except for traditional joint revenue sharing arrangements as revenue is recognized over the lease term, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 
 2024 2023 (In thousands of U.S. Dollars, except number of systems) Number of Systems Revenue Number of Systems Revenue New IMAX System 12 11,363 14 11,215 Upgraded IMAX System 8 9,424 2 883 Total IMAX Systems 
 20 20,787 16 12,098 
 
 Included in the table above is one IMAX System which was relocated from its original location (2023 one IMAX System). When a system under a sale or sales-type lease arrangement is relocated, the amount of revenue earned by the Company may vary from transaction-to-transaction and is usually less than the amount earned for a new sale. In certain situations when a system is relocated, the original location is upgraded to an IMAX Laser System. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Technology Products and Services segment revenue increased by 1.8 million , or 3 , while gross margin decreased by 1.8 million, or 5 , when compared to the same period in 2023. These results reflect an increase in system installations under sales arrangements that offset the impact of a lower level of rental revenues, which is box office dependent. Rental revenues decreased by 6.9 million, driven by GBO from joint revenue sharing arrangements which decreased by 35.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the prior year comparative period, from 159.5 million to 124.3 million. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, gross margin percent was 55 compared to 60 in the prior period with the decrease being driven by the lower level of IMAX box office year over year. 
 
 All Other 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, All Other revenue and gross margin decreased by 0.2 million and less than 0.1 million, respectively, when compared to the same period in 2023, principally due to the performance of the Company s one owned and operated theater. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 The following table presents information about the Company s Selling, General and Administrative Expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 (1) A portion of share-based compensation expense is recognized within Costs and Expenses Applicable to Revenues, and Research and Development. (Refer to Capital Stock and Reserves Share-Based Compensation in Note 11 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1.) 

For the third quarter of 2024, the lower level of Selling, General and Administrative Expenses year over year is driven by inclusion in the prior year of 3.1 million in transaction expenses associated with the proposal to acquire the outstanding shares in IMAX China. Also contributing to the decline year over year is the timing of expenditures, adjustments in certain estimates relating to payouts in connection with our streaming and consumer technology division as well as management s continued focus on operational efficiencies, which were partially offset by the impact of higher inflation during the period. 

Research and Development 
 
 The Company believes that it is a premier global technology platform for awe-inspiring entertainment and events with significant proprietary expertise in digital and film-based projection and sound system component design, engineering, and imaging technology, particularly in laser-based technology. A significant portion of the Company s research and development efforts have been focused on the IMAX Laser Systems, which the Company believes is capable of illuminating the largest screens in the IMAX network and provides greater brightness and clarity, higher contrast, a wider color gamut and deeper blacks, while consuming less power and lasting longer than existing digital technology, to ensure that the Company continues to provide the highest quality, premier cinematic experience available to consumers. The Company has continued research and development aimed at creating more affordable laser-based solutions with various screen sizes for its commercial multiplex customers. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a net cost recovery for its Research and Development activity of 0.3 million, compared to an expense of 2.8 million during the same period in the prior year. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company concluded that technological feasibility of the new IMAX film cameras was achieved resulting in the capitalization of costs incurred. 
 
 The Company intends to continue research and development to further evolve its end-to-end technology. This includes bringing connectivity to the Company s global network to support live and interactive events worldwide; developing new IMAX film cameras and certifying additional digital cameras; further improving its proprietary Film Remastering and distribution process for the delivery of content for both theatrical (including local language content) and home entertainment; and further improving the reliability of its projectors, as well as enhancing the Company s image and sound quality. Within the Company s Streaming and Consumer Technology business, there is ongoing research and development in perceptual metrics involving novel measurement and optimization techniques. Investments are also being made to expand existing and/or develop new technologies which are expected to further enhance video quality, delivery, and creation across devices. Furthermore, the Company intends to invest in activities that will capture opportunities to create/build AI and automation into its operations and processes. 

Credit Loss (Reversal) Expense, Net 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a credit loss reversal of 1.1 million, as compared to a credit loss expense of 0.5 million recognized in the prior year primarily due to increases in collections of the Company s account receivables, primarily in China, as exhibition partners continue to improve their cash position post pandemic. 
 
 Management s judgments regarding expected credit losses are based on the facts available to management at the time that the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared and involve estimates about the future. As a result, the Company s judgments and associated estimates of credit losses may ultimately prove, with the benefit of hindsight, to be incorrect. (Refer to Note 3 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1.) 

Interest Expense, net 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense was 2.2 million, representing an increase of 0.8 million, or 51 when compared to interest expense of 1.5 million during the same period of the prior year primarily due to a higher level of borrowings under the Credit Facility in the current period. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, interest income was 0.6 million and 0.7 million, respectively.

Table of Contents 

Income Taxes 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an income tax expense of 2.4 million (2023 tax expense of 6.6 million). The Company s effective tax rate of 13.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 differs from the Canadian statutory rate of 26.5 primarily due to tax rate differences in foreign jurisdictions and a decrease in the valuation allowance which was partially offset by an increase in tax reserves, tax return adjustments and withholding taxes. The Company s effective tax rate of 30.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 differs from the Canadian statutory rate of 26.5 primarily due to tax rate differences in foreign jurisdictions which was offset by an increase in the valuation allowance, tax return adjustments and withholding taxes. (Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1). 

Non-Controlling Interests 
 
 The Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements primarily include the non-controlling interest in the net income or loss of IMAX China, as well as the impact of non-controlling interests in the activity of its Original Film Fund subsidiary. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the net income attributable to non-controlling interests of the Company s subsidiaries was 1.4 million, a decrease of 1.6 million, when compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to lower IMAX box office earned in Greater China.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s revenues and gross margin decreased by 29.3 million or 10 and 28.8 million or 17 , respectively, when compared to same period in 2023, principally due to weaker IMAX box office performance driven in part by the Hollywood strike impact on the film slate and a less favorable mix of content across our global network. These year over year declines were partially offset by the sale of commercial and streaming rights for an IMAX documentary and higher revenues associated with alternative content.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Content Solutions segment revenues and gross margin decreased by 8.4 million, or 8 , and 9.7 million, or 15 , respectively, when compared to the same period in 2023. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, box office generated by IMAX films totaled 696.5 million, a 192.4 million or 22 decrease versus the prior year comparative period of 888.9 million driven in part by the Hollywood strike impact on the film slate and a less favorable mix of content globally which included fewer blockbusters in 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, IMAX box office was generated by the exhibition of 104 films and other content (83 new and 21 that were originally released in prior years), including Dune: Part Two 145 million) , Deadpool Wolverine 83 million), Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire 41 million), Inside Out 2 39 million), and Alien: Romulus 39 million). Additionally, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, local language films exhibited across the Company s global network generated over 114 million in box office, representing 16 of its total box office. Leading local language titles distributed across the IMAX network in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included the Chinese films Pegasus 2 and Yolo , the Japanese film Haikyu!! , and the Korean concert film, IM Hero: The Stadium . In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, IMAX box office was generated by the exhibition of 84 films (67 new films and 17 films that were originally released in prior year) including Oppenheimer , which generated box office of over 180 million, and local language Chinese titles Wandering Earth 2 49 million) and Creation of the Gods 1: Kingdom of Storms 32 million). 
 
 The impact on revenue from the lower box office experienced year over year was partially offset by the revenue earned from the completion of the sale of worldwide rights to the Company s original documentary, The Blue Angels , to Amazon Content during the period as well as from higher revenues from alternative content. 
 
 In addition to the level of revenues, Content Solutions segment gross margin is influenced by the costs associated with films and other content (documentaries, live. alternative and other) exhibited in the period. The costs associated with films and other content can include production, post-production, distribution and marketing, which are expensed as incurred. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross margin percent was 55 compared to 60 in the prior year period. The decrease was due to the lower level of IMAX box office receipts and the higher mix of self-produced content being released during the period, including The Blue Angels . 
 
 Technology Products and Services 
 
 The primary drivers of Technology Products and Services segment results are the number of IMAX Systems installed in a period, the costs associated with each installation, lease payments tied to the box office performance of the films released to the IMAX network, as well as the associated maintenance contracts that accompany each installation. The average revenue and gross margin per IMAX System under sale and sales-type lease arrangements vary depending upon the number of IMAX System commitments with a single respective exhibitor, an exhibitor s location, the type of system sold, and various other factors. The installation of IMAX Systems in theaters or multiplexes, which make up a large portion of the Company s system backlog, depends primarily on the timing of the construction of those projects, which is not under the Company s control.

Table of Contents 

 The following table provides information about IMAX Systems installed and the associated revenue recognized at that time, except for traditional joint revenue sharing arrangements as revenue is recognized over the lease term, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30,

 Included in the table above are four IMAX Systems which were relocated from its original location (2023 two IMAX Systems). When a system under a sale or sales-type lease arrangement is relocated, the amount of revenue earned by the Company may vary from transaction-to-transaction and is usually less than the amount earned for a new sale. In certain situations when a system is relocated, the original location is upgraded to an IMAX Laser System. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Technology Products and Services segment revenue and gross margin decreased by 19.8 million, or 12 , and 18.7 million, or 19 , respectively, when compared to the same period in the prior year, The lower level of revenue is primarily driven by a lower level of rental revenues which is box office dependent. Rental revenues decreased by 14.1 million, as a result of GBO from joint revenue sharing arrangements which decreased by 85.0 million or 20 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the prior year comparative period, from 435.7 million to 350.7 million. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 gross margin percent was 54 compared to 58 in the prior period, primarily the result of lower rental revenues, as described above. 
 
 All Other 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, All Other revenue and gross margin decreased by 1.1 million, or 12 , and 0.4 million, or 6 , respectively, when compared to the same period in 2023, which principally reflects the performance of the Company s one owned and operated theater coupled with the mix in revenue from the Company s Streaming and Consumer Technology operations. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 The following table presents information about the Company s Selling, General and Administrative Expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 (2) See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for a description of this non-GAAP financial measure and a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP amount. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the lower level of Selling, General and Administrative Expenses year over year reflects the inclusion in the prior year of 3.1 million in transaction expenses associated with the proposal to acquire the outstanding shares in IMAX China. Also contributing to the decline year over year is the timing of expenditures, adjustments in certain estimates relating to payouts in connection with our streaming and consumer technology division as well as management s continued focus on operational efficiencies, which were partially offset by the impact of higher inflation during the period.

 Research and Development 
 
 The Company believes that it is a premier global technology platform for awe-inspiring entertainment and events with significant proprietary expertise in digital and film-based projection and sound system component design, engineering, and imaging technology, particularly in laser-based technology. A significant portion of the Company s research and development efforts have been focused on the IMAX Laser Systems, which the Company believes is capable of illuminating the largest screens in the IMAX network and provides greater brightness and clarity, higher contrast, a wider color gamut and deeper blacks, while consuming less power and lasting longer than existing digital technology, to ensure that the Company continues to provide the highest quality, premier cinematic experience available to consumers. The Company has continued research and development aimed at creating more affordable laser-based solutions with various screen sizes for its commercial multiplex customers. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Research and Development expenses were 4.0 million, representing a decrease of 3.4 million, or 46 , when compared to Research and Development expenses of 7.4 million during the same period in the prior year. The current period expenses reflects the capitalization of costs related to the development of the new IMAX film cameras upon the conclusion of technological feasibility. This decrease was partially offset by continued investment in other R D projects including developing new Streaming Technology product offerings. 
 
 The Company intends to continue research and development to further evolve its end-to-end technology. This includes bringing connectivity to the Company s global network to support live and interactive events worldwide; developing new IMAX film cameras and certifying additional digital cameras; further improving its proprietary Film Remastering and distribution process for the delivery of content for both theatrical (including local language content) and home entertainment; and further improving the reliability of its projectors, as well as enhancing the Company s image and sound quality. Within the Company s Streaming and Consumer Technology business, there is ongoing research and development in perceptual metrics involving novel measurement and optimization techniques. Investments are also being made to expand existing and/or develop new technologies which are expected to further enhance video quality, delivery, and creation across devices. Furthermore, the Company intends to invest in activities that will capture opportunities to create/build AI and automation into its operations and processes. 

Credit Loss (Reversal) Expense, Net 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a credit loss reversal of 1.0 million, as compared to a credit loss expense of 1.6 million recognized in the prior year due to increases in collections of the Company s account receivables, primarily in China, as exhibition partners continue to improve their cash position post pandemic. 
 
 Management s judgments regarding expected credit losses are based on the facts available to management at the time that the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared and involve estimates about the future. As a result, the Company s judgments and associated estimates of credit losses may ultimately prove, with the benefit of hindsight, to be incorrect. (Refer to Note 3 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1). 

Interest Expense, net 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense was 6.5 million representing an increase of 1.4 million, or 28 as compared to 5.0 million during the same period of the prior year which primarily reflects a higher average level of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility in the current period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, interest income was 1.7 million and 1.8 million, respectively. 

Income Taxes 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an income tax expense of 3.5 million (2023 tax expense of 14.9 million). The Company s effective tax rate of 12.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 differs from the Canadian statutory rate of 26.5 primarily due to tax rate differences in foreign jurisdictions and a tax benefit related to an internal asset sale during the quarter which was partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance, tax reserves, tax return adjustments, withholding taxes and a shortfall in tax benefits related to share-based compensation. The Company s effective tax rate of 33.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 differs from the Canadian statutory rate of 26.5 primarily due to tax rate differences in foreign jurisdictions which was offset by an increase in the valuation allowance, tax return adjustments and withholding taxes. 
 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed an internal asset sale to more closely align its intellectual property ownership with its operations. In order to effect this internal asset sale, transactions between entities within the group resulted in capital gains for tax purposes. The tax expense related to the capital gain was partially offset by the reversal of the valuation allowance. Net deferred tax assets were also recorded on the transaction, resulting in a net tax benefit of 7.7 million. (Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1).

Non-Controlling Interests 
 
 The Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements primarily include the non-controlling interest in the net income or loss of IMAX China, as well as the impact of non-controlling interests in the activity of its Original Film Fund subsidiary. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net income attributable to non-controlling interests of the Company s subsidiaries was 5.1 million, a decrease of 1.9 million, when compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to lower IMAX box office earned in Greater China. 

CASH FLOWS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 The net cash used in or provided by the Company s operating activities is affected by a number of factors, including: (i) the level of cash collections from customers in respect of existing IMAX System sale and lease agreements, (ii) the amount of upfront payments collected in respect of IMAX System sale and lease agreements in backlog, (iii) the box office performance of films and other content distributed by the Company and/or released to IMAX locations, (iv) the level of inventory purchases and investment in joint revenue sharing arrangements, and (v) the level of the Company s operating expenses, including expenses for research and development and new business initiatives. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by the Company s operating activities totaled 59.4 million, as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 54.6 million in the same period of the prior year, an increase of 4.7 million. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net cash provided by the Company s operating activities is principally a result of a decrease in Accounts Receivable of 23.0 million which primarily reflects an improvement in the financial health of exhibitor customers, partially offset by 17.9 million of expenditures incurred in connection with the development of film assets and 6.2 million in inventory purchases. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the net cash provided by the Company s operating activities was principally a result of revenue growth attributable to the record box office performance of films distributed through the IMAX network, revenue from the installation of IMAX Systems and revenue associated with the amendments and renewals of IMAX Systems arrangements, partially offset by 15.0 million of variable consideration receivables, 13.8 million in inventory purchases, and 14.6 million of expenditures incurred in connection with the development of Film Assets. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities totaled 30.3 million, as compared to 18.7 million in the same period of the prior year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net cash used in investing activities is primarily driven by 21.7 million invested in equipment to be used as the Company installs systems under joint revenue sharing arrangements with exhibitor customers, 4.8 million of intangible assets principally related to the purchase or continued development of internal use software, and 3.8 million in purchases of property, plant and equipment. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the net cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by 10.7 million invested in equipment to be used in the Company s joint revenue sharing arrangements with exhibitor customers, 2.5 million in purchases of property, plant and equipment, and 5.4 million of intangible assets acquired, principally related to the purchase or continued development of internal use software. 
 
 Based on management s current operating plan for the remainder of 2024, the Company expects to continue to use cash to deploy additional IMAX Systems under joint revenue sharing arrangements. 
 
 Capital expenditures, including the Company s investment in joint revenue sharing arrangements, the purchase of property, plant and equipment, the acquisition of other intangible assets, and investments in films , were 48.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 33.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company expects its investment in joint revenue sharing arrangements to be more heavily weighted toward the remainder of the year which aligns with the historical seasonality of system installations.

 Financing Activities 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities totaled 1.0 million, as compared to 24.3 million in the same period of the prior year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net cash used in financing activities is principally due to 18.1 million used to repurchase common shares of the Company and IMAX China and 5.0 million in taxes withheld and paid on vested employee stock awards. These uses of cash were mostly offset by 23.0 million in net borrowings under the Company s revolving credit facilities. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in financing activities was principally due to 12.0 million in net repayments of revolving credit facility borrowings, 4.3 million used to repurchase common shares of the Company, 6.5 million in taxes withheld and paid on vested employee stock awards, and 1.4 million in dividends paid to non-controlling interests. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company s principal sources of liquidity included: (i) its balances of cash and cash equivalents of 104.5 million; (ii) the anticipated collection of trade accounts receivable, which includes amounts owed under joint revenue sharing arrangements and Film Remastering and distribution agreements with movie studios; (iii) the anticipated collection of financing and variable consideration receivables due in the next 12 months under sale and sales-type lease arrangements for systems currently in operation; and (iv) installment payments expected in the next 12 months under sale and sales-type lease arrangements in backlog. Under the terms of the Company s typical sale and sales-type lease agreements, the Company receives substantial cash payments before it completes the performance of its contractual obligations. 
 
 In addition, as of September 30, 2024, the Company had 253.0 million in available borrowing capacity under its Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the Credit Agreement ), 27.1 million in available borrowing capacity under the IMAX (Shanghai) Multimedia Technology Co., Ltd. IMAX Shanghai revolving credit facility with the Bank of China (the Bank of China Facility ), and 28.5 million in available borrowing capacity under IMAX Shanghai s revolving credit facility with HSBC Bank (China) Company Limited, Shanghai Branch (the HSBC China Facility ). (Refer to Borrowings Revolving Credit Facility Borrowings, Net in Note 6 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 for a description of the material terms of the Credit Agreement, the Bank of China Facility, and the HSBC Facility.) 

The Company s 104.5 million balance of cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 (December 31, 2023 76.2 million) includes 90.8 million in cash held outside of Canada (December 31, 2023 68.5 million), of which 49.9 million was held in the People s Republic of China (the PRC (December 31, 2023 30.0 million). Management reassessed its strategy with respect to the most efficient means of deploying the Company s capital resources globally and determined that historical earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries in excess of amounts required to sustain business operations would no longer be indefinitely reinvested. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, no historical earnings from a subsidiary in PRC were distributed (2023 24.0 million) and, as a result, no foreign withholding taxes were paid to the relevant tax authorities (2023 2.4 million). As of September 30, 2024, the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets include a deferred tax liability of 12.5 million for the applicable foreign withholding taxes associated with the remaining balance of non-repatriated historical earnings that will not be indefinitely reinvested outside of Canada. These taxes will become payable upon the repatriation of any such earnings. 
 
 The Company forecasts its future cash flow and short-term liquidity requirements on an ongoing basis. These forecasts are based on estimates and may be materially impacted by factors that are outside of the Company s control (including the factors described in Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the Company s 2023 Form 10-K as supplemented by Risk Factors in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q). As a result, there is no guarantee that these forecasts will come to fruition and that the Company will be able to fund its operations through cash flows from operations. In particular, the Company s operating cash flows and cash balances will be adversely impacted if management s projections of future signings and installations of IMAX Systems and box office performance of IMAX content are not realized. 
 
 Based on the Company s current cash balances and operating cash flows, management expects to have sufficient capital and liquidity to fund its anticipated operating needs and capital requirements during the next twelve-month period following the date of this report.

(Refer to Borrowings Convertible Notes and Other Borrowings, Net in Note 6 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1.) 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 
 There are currently no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on the Company s financial condition. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Management s judgments, assumptions, and estimates are based on historical experience, future expectations, and other factors that are believed to be reasonable as of the date of the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results may ultimately differ from the Company s original estimates, as future events and circumstances sometimes do not develop as expected, and the differences may be material. For more information on the Company s critical accounting estimates refer to the section entitled Critical Accounting Estimates in Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the 2023 Form 10-K. 

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
 
 Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards and their impact on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 
 GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. In this report, the Company presents financial measures in accordance with GAAP and also on a non-GAAP basis under the SEC regulations. Specifically, the Company presents the following non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental measures of its performance: 
 
 Adjusted net income or loss attributable to common shareholders; 
 
 Adjusted net income or loss attributable to common shareholders per basic and diluted share; 
 61 

Table of Contents 

EBITDA; and 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility. 
 
 Adjusted net income or loss attributable to common shareholders and adjusted net income or loss attributable to common shareholders per basic and diluted share exclude, where applicable: (i) share-based compensation; (ii) realized and unrealized investment gains or losses; (iii) transaction-related expenses; and (iv) restructuring and executive transition costs, as well as the related tax impact of these adjustments. 
 
 The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are important supplemental measures that allow management and users of the Company s financial statements to view operating trends and analyze controllable operating performance on a comparable basis between periods without the after-tax impact of share-based compensation and certain unusual items included in net income attributable to common shareholders. Although share-based compensation is an important aspect of the Company s employee and executive compensation packages, it is a non-cash expense and is excluded from certain internal business performance measures. 
 
 Reconciliations of net income attributable to common shareholders and the associated per share amounts to adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders and adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders per diluted share are presented in the tables below.

Table of Contents 

 In addition to the non-GAAP financial measures discussed above, management also uses EBITDA, as such term is defined in the Credit Agreement, and which is referred to herein as Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility. As allowed by the Credit Agreement, Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility includes adjustments in addition to the exclusion of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Accordingly, this non-GAAP financial measure is presented to allow a more comprehensive analysis of the Company s operating performance and to provide additional information with respect to the Company s compliance with its Credit Agreement requirements, when applicable. In addition, the Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility presents relevant and useful information widely used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in the Company s industry to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company s results. 
 
 EBITDA is defined as net income or loss excluding: (i) income tax expense or benefit; (ii) interest expense, net of interest income; (iii) depreciation and amortization, including film asset amortization; and (iv) amortization of deferred financing costs. Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility is defined as EBITDA excluding: (i) share-based and other non-cash compensation; (ii) realized and unrealized investment gains or losses; (iii) transaction-related expenses; (iv) restructuring and executive transition costs; and (v) write- downs, net of recoveries, including asset impairments and credit loss expense.

 (1) The amortization of deferred financing costs is recorded within Interest Expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

The Company also adjusts Selling, General and Administrative Expenses to exclude a portion of share-based compensation and related payroll taxes. Management uses non-U.S. GAAP and other financial measures such as this, internally for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. IMAX believes that this non-U.S. GAAP measure provides useful information about operating results, enhances the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management and its financial and operational decision making. 
 
 A reconciliation of Selling, General and Administrative Expenses, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations in Part I, Item 1, to Adjusted SG A, is presented in the table below.

The Company cautions users of its financial statements that these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Additionally, the non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, or superior to, the comparable GAAP amounts. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 The Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, which could affect operating results, financial position and cash flows. Market risk is the potential change in an instrument s value caused by, for example, fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. The Company s primary market risk exposure is the risk of unfavorable movements in exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar, the Canadian Dollar, and Chinese Renminbi RMB ). The Company does not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes.

Table of Contents 

 Foreign Exchange Rate Risk 
 
 A majority of the Company s revenue is denominated in U.S. Dollars while a significant portion of its costs and expenses is denominated in Canadian Dollars. A portion of the Company s net U.S. Dollar cash flows is converted to Canadian Dollars to fund Canadian Dollar expenses through the spot market. In addition, IMAX films generate box office in 89 different countries, and therefore unfavorable exchange rates between applicable local currencies and the U.S. Dollar could have an impact on the GBO generated by the Company s exhibitor customers and its revenues. The Company has incoming cash flows from its revenue generating IMAX network and ongoing operating expenses in China through its majority-owned subsidiary IMAX Shanghai. In Japan, the Company has ongoing Yen-denominated operating expenses related to its Japanese operations. Net RMB and Japanese Yen cash flows are converted to U.S. Dollars through the spot market. The Company also has cash receipts under leases denominated in RMB, Japanese Yen, British Pound Sterling, Euros and Canadian Dollars. 
 
 The Company manages its exposure to foreign exchange rate risks through its regular operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. These derivative financial instruments are utilized to hedge economic exposures as well as reduce earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from shifts in market rates. 
 
 Certain of the Company s PRC subsidiaries held approximately RMB 349.3 million 49.9 million) in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 (December 31, 2023 RMB 213.0 million or 30.0 million) and are required to transact locally in RMB. Foreign currency exchange transactions, including the remittance of any funds into and out of the PRC, are subject to controls and require the approval of the China State Administration of Foreign Exchange to complete. Any developments relating to the Chinese economy and any actions taken by the Chinese government are beyond the control of the Company; however, the Company monitors and manages its capital and liquidity requirements to ensure compliance with local regulatory and policy requirements. (Refer to Risk Factors The Company faces risks in connection with its significant presence in China and the continued expansion of its business there in Part II, Item 1A. of this Form 10-Q.) 
 
 Management also monitors the macroeconomic environment as part of its continuous assessment of credit risk. This includes consideration of developments in the U.S. and global banking sectors following recent banking collapses, which informs management s assessment of any potential direct and indirect impacts on the Company. There are no concentrations of cash and cash equivalents in any regional banking institutions, such that management considers there to be any material risk in this regard. 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded foreign exchange net losses of 0.3 million and 0.8 million, respectively, resulting from changes in exchange rates related to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities (2023 net losses of 0.2 million and 0.8 million, respectively). 

The Company has entered into a series of foreign currency forward contracts to manage the risks associated with the volatility of foreign currencies. Certain of these foreign currency forward contracts met the criteria required for hedge accounting under the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the FASB ASC at inception, and continue to meet hedge effectiveness tests as of September 30, 2024, with settlement dates throughout 2024 and 2025. Foreign currency derivatives are recognized and measured in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) are recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations except for derivatives designated and qualifying as foreign currency cash flow hedging instruments. The Company currently has cash flow hedging instruments associated with Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. For foreign currency cash flow hedging instruments related to Selling, General and Administrative Expenses, the effective portion of the gain or loss in a hedge of a forecasted transaction is reported within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) and reclassified to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations when the forecasted transaction occurs. Any ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

The notional value of foreign currency cash flow hedging instruments that qualify for hedge accounting as of September 30, 2024 was 31.8 million (December 31, 2023 40.6 million). Gains of 0.3 million and losses of 0.9 million were recorded to Other Comprehensive Income with respect to the change in fair value of these contracts for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively (2023 losses of 1.0 million and 0.2 million, respectively). Losses of 0.2 million and 0.2 million were reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss to Selling, General and Administrative Expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively (2023 loss of 0.2 million and 0.6 million, respectively). The Company currently does not hold any derivatives which are not designated as hedging instruments. 

For all derivative instruments, the Company is subject to counterparty credit risk to the extent that the counterparty may not meet its obligations to the Company. To manage this risk, the Company enters into derivative transactions only with major financial institution s.

Table of Contents 

 As of September 30, 2024, the Company s Financing Receivables and working capital items denominated in Canadian Dollars, RMB, Japanese Yen, Euros and other foreign currencies translated into U.S. Dollars was 161.4 million. Assuming a 10 appreciation or depreciation in foreign currency exchange rates from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates as of September 30, 2024, the potential change in the fair value of foreign currency-denominated financing receivables and working capital items would have been 16.1 million. A significant portion of the Company s Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses is denominated in Canadian Dollars. Assuming a 1 change appreciation or depreciation in foreign currency exchange rates as of September 30, 2024, the potential change in the amount of Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses would be 0.3 million. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk Management 
 
 The Company s earnings may also be affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on its interest income from cash, and its interest expense from variable-rate borrowings that may be made under the Credit Facility. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had drawn down 47.0 million on its Credit Facility (December 31, 2023 24.0 million), and nil on its HSBC China Facility (December 31, 2023 nil) and nil on its Bank of China Facility (December 31, 2023 nil), which are subject to variable effective interest rates. 
 
 The Company had variable rate debt instruments representing 10.0 and 5.0 of its total liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. If the interest rates available to the Company increased by 10 , the Company s interest expense would increase by 0.3 million and interest income from cash would increase by 0.1 million. These amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the Company s variable rate debt and cash balances as of September 30, 2024. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the specified time periods and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), to allow timely discussions regarding required disclosure. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 
 
 The Company s management, with the participation of its CEO and its CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2024 and has concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. The Company will continue to periodically evaluate its disclosure controls and procedures and will make modifications from time to time as deemed necessary to ensure that information is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting which occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 Refer to Note 7 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 for information regarding legal proceedings involving the Company. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 This Form 10-Q should be read together with, and supplement, the risk factors in Item 1A Risk Factors in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K, which describes various risks and uncertainties to which the Company is or may become subject. The risk factors described below update certain risk factors included in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K in light of recent events. The below risk factors and the risk factors included in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect its business, financial condition and/or operating results. 
 
 The Company faces risks in connection with its significant presence in China and the continued expansion of its business there. 
 
 Greater China is the Company s largest market by revenue, with approximately 25 of overall revenues generated from its Greater China operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 808 IMAX Systems operating in Greater China with an additional 254 systems in backlog, which represent 54 of the Company s current backlog. Of the IMAX Systems currently scheduled to be installed in Greater China, 80 are under joint revenue sharing arrangements, which further increases the Company s ongoing exposure to box office performance in this market. 
 
 The China market faces a number of risks, including a continued slow recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in laws and regulations, currency fluctuations, increased competition, and changes in economic conditions, including the risk of an economic downturn or recession, trade embargoes, restrictions or other barriers, as well as other conditions that may impact the Company s exhibitor and studio partners, and consumer spending. The market s slow recovery from the pandemic has caused some theatrical exhibitors in Mainland China, including several of the Company s exhibitor partners, to experience financial difficulties which, in certain cases, has resulted in delays in meeting payment and theater system installation obligations to the Company. There are no guarantees that such financial difficulties will not continue, or that partner delays or failures to meet contractual obligations will not occur in the future, adversely impacting the Company s future revenues and cash flows. 
 
 The Company does not believe that it is currently required to obtain any permission or approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the Cyberspace Administration of China or any other regulatory authority in the PRC for its operations, but there can be no assurance that such permissions or approvals would not be required in the future and, if required, that they would be granted in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all. Furthermore, PRC regulators, including the Cyberspace Administration of China, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and the Ministry of Public Security, have been increasingly focused on regulation in data security and data protection. Regulatory requirements concerning data protection and cybersecurity, as well as other requirements concerning operations of foreign businesses, in the PRC are evolving, and their enactment timetable, interpretation and implementation involve significant uncertainties. To the extent any additional PRC laws and regulations become applicable to the Company, it may be subject to increased risks and uncertainties associated with the legal system in the PRC, including with respect to the enforcement of laws and the possibility of changes of rules and regulations with little or no advance notice. 
 
 Certain risks and uncertainties of doing business in China are solely within the control of the Chinese government, and Chinese law regulates both the scope of the Company s continued expansion in China and the Company s business within China. For instance, the Chinese government regulates the number, timing, and terms of Hollywood films released to the China market. A number of prominent Hollywood films were denied release dates in China in 2021 and 2022, including several films released in IMAX format in other markets. While significantly more Hollywood films were given release dates in China in 2023 and 2024, several of the prominent Hollywood sequels or franchise films released into China have underperformed their predecessors in that market. The Company cannot provide assurance that the Chinese government will continue to permit the release of Hollywood IMAX films in China or that the timing, number or performance of IMAX releases will be favorable to the Company. There are also uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights in China. If the Company were unable to navigate China s regulatory environment, or if the Company were unable to enforce its intellectual property or contract rights in China, the Company s business could be adversely impacted. 
 
 The worsening of United States China political tensions could exacerbate any or all of these risks, and adverse developments in any of these areas could impact the Company s future revenues and cash flows and could cause the Company to fail to achieve anticipated growth in Mainland China.

Table of Contents 

 The Company may not convert all of its backlog into revenue and cash flows. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company s backlog included 472 IMAX Systems, consisting of 170 IMAX Systems under sales or lease arrangements and 302 IMAX Systems under joint revenue sharing arrangements. The Company lists signed contracts for IMAX Systems for which revenue has not been recognized as backlog prior to the time of revenue recognition. The total value of the backlog represents all binding IMAX System sale or lease agreements scheduled to be installed in the future. Backlog value includes initial fees along with the estimated present value of contractual ongoing fees due over the term, and a variable consideration estimate for the IMAX Systems under sales arrangements, but excludes amounts allocated to maintenance and extended warranty revenues. Notwithstanding their legal obligations, some of the Company s exhibition customers with which it has signed contracts may be delinquent in their contractual payments and/or not accept delivery of IMAX Systems that are included in the Company s backlog. An economic or industry downturn may exacerbate exhibition customer liquidity constraints and the risk of customers not accepting delivery of IMAX Systems. Customers sometimes request that the Company agree to modify their obligations concerning systems in backlog, which the Company has agreed to do in the past under certain circumstances, and may agree to do in the future. Customer-requested delays in the installation of IMAX Systems in backlog remain a recurring and unpredictable part of the Company s business. China s slow recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic has caused several of the Company s exhibition partners there to delay payment or theater system installation obligations to the Company. Any reduction or change in backlog could adversely affect the Company s future revenues and cash flows. 
 
 There is collection risk associated with payments to be received over the terms of the Company s IMAX System agreements. 
 
 The Company is dependent in part on the viability of its exhibitors for collections under long-term leases, sales financing agreements, and joint revenue sharing arrangements. Exhibitors or other operators may experience financial difficulties that could cause them to be unable to fulfill their contractual payment obligations to the Company. As a result, the Company s future revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 
 On June 12, 2017, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a 200.0 million share repurchase program for its common shares that would have expired on June 30, 2020, which was subsequently extended for a 12-month period in 2020, 2021, and 2022 and increased in the total share repurchase authority to 400.0 million. In 2023, the Board of Directors approved a 36-month extension to the share repurchase program through June 30, 2026. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 150.7 million available under the program. The repurchases may be made either in the open market or through private transactions, including repurchases made pursuant to a plan intended to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other relevant factors. The Company has no obligation to repurchase shares and the share repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued by the Company at any time. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any common shares under the Company s publicly announced program, and there are no other programs under which the Company repurchases shares. 
 
 The Company s common share repurchase program activity for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was as follows: 
 
 Total number of shares purchased 
 
 Average price paid per share 
 Total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced program 
 Maximum approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under the program 
 July 1 through July 31, 2024 
 150,720,352 August 1 through August 31, 2024 
 150,720,352 September 1 through September 30, 2024 
 150,720,352 Total
