 Transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations 
 
 Topic 606 requires that the Company disclose the aggregate amount of transaction price that is allocated to performance obligations that have not yet been satisfied as of September 30, 2024. The Company has elected not to disclose transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for: 
 
 1. Contracts with an original duration of one year or less, including contracts that can be terminated for convenience without a substantive penalty. 
 2. Contracts for which the Company recognizes revenues based on the right to invoice for services performed. 
 3. Variable consideration allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation or to a wholly unsatisfied promise to transfer a distinct good or service that forms part of a single performance obligation in accordance with Topic 606 Section 10-25-14(b), for which the criteria in Topic 606 Section 10-32-40 have been met. This applies to a limited number of situations where the Company is dependent upon data from a third party or where fees are highly variable. 
 
 Many of the Company s performance obligations meet one or more of these exemptions. Specifically, the Company has excluded the following from the Company s remaining performance obligations, all of which will be resolved in the period in which amounts are known:

 million secured promissory note (the Note ). As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of the Note after the consideration of the allowance for credit loss was approximately million. The Company determined the allowance on the Note using a discounted cash flow analysis, which discounts the expected future cash flows of the asset to determine the collectible amount. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2023, the interest payment for the Note was not received by the Company from STIN. In the third quarter of 2023 the Company reassessed the collectability of the Note and determined that a full allowance for credit losses was required equal to the carrying value of the Note, recorded within the Selling, general and administrative expenses line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 
 During the first quarter of 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with STIN and APC to amend the aforementioned promissory note and reduce the principal balance to million, forgive outstanding accrued interest and extend the maturity date of the Note to September 2027. Certain circumstances may enable the Company to receive consideration in excess of the amended principal balance. In the first quarter of 2024 the Company reassessed the collectability of the note and determined a full allowance for credit losses was required equal to the carrying value of the note. Accordingly, the modification of the terms of the Note had no net impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

million of the proceeds from the Term Loan and million non-interest-bearing deferred consideration, payable to B. Riley calendar days following the Effective Date, for a total consideration of million the total consideration to repurchase of its outstanding Series B Perpetual Non-Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series B Preferred and of its outstanding Senior Notes from B. Riley Principal Investments, LLC BRPI ), a related party. 
 
 The fair value of Series B Preferred stock of million was determined using a discounted cash flow model using level two inputs. The carrying value of Series B Preferred was million. The second quarter s accrued dividend of million was forgiven at the time of the repurchase. The Series B Preferred repurchase gain of million was calculated as the fair value of consideration paid less the carrying value, less the second quarter s accrued dividend forgiven. The million gain was accounted for as capital transaction and reflected as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital APIC ). While the transaction was not reflected in the income statement, the gain was reflected in the adjustment to net income from common shareholders for purposes of calculating EPS, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Company allocated million of the total consideration to the Series B Preferred based on the fair value and allocated the remaining consideration of million to the Senior Notes repurchase. The carrying value of Senior notes repurchased was million including million of unamortized debt issuance costs. The second quarter s accrued interest of million was forgiven at the time of the repurchase. The Senior Note Repurchase gain of million was calculated as the remaining consideration paid of million less the carrying value, less the second quarter s accrued interest forgiven. The Company accounted for the debt repurchase as a redemption with a related party. ASC 470-50-40-2 indicates that such an extinguishment transaction may be in essence a capital transaction. Therefore, the transaction was accounted for as a capital transaction and reflected as an adjustment to APIC, which resulted in a gain of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and immaterial amount for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company recognized an income tax expense of approximately million and million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate was approximately for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to the impact of permanent adjustments, most notably Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, partially offset by foreign tax rate differential. The Company s projection of U.S. current income tax expense for the period is driven by the impact of Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income and enacted Internal Revenue Code Section 174 rules that require the Company to capitalize and amortize qualifying research and development expenses and by operating income generated in certain foreign jurisdictions. The Company s effective tax rate was approximately ) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to pre-tax losses in jurisdictions where full valuation allowances have been recorded and certain jurisdictions projecting current income tax expense. The Company continues to consider all available evidence, including historical profitability and projections of future taxable income together with new evidence, both positive and negative, that could affect the view of the future realization of deferred tax assets. As a result of this analysis, the Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets of the U.S. and most foreign jurisdictions as the realization of these assets is not more likely than not, given the uncertainty of future earnings in these jurisdictions. 
 
 Unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions were million at September 30, 2024. We are not able to reasonably estimate when we would make any cash payments required to settle these liabilities, but we do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations will materially affect our liquidity. It is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately million over the next twelve months. 
 
 During 2021 the Internal Revenue Service commenced an audit of certain of the Company s prior year U.S. federal income tax filings, including the 2013 through 2020 tax years. The audit is currently ongoing and while the receipt of the associated refunds would materially improve its financial position, the Company does not believe that the results of this audit will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations. The Company has not accrued for any potential interest income related to the expected tax refund as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Pillar Two Global Anti-Base Erosion rules issued by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD"), a global policy forum, introduced a global minimum tax of 15 which would apply to multinational groups with consolidated financial statement revenue in excess of EUR 750 million. Nearly all OECD member jurisdictions have agreed in principle to adopt these provisions and numerous jurisdictions, including jurisdictions where the Company operates, have enacted these rules effective January 1, 2024. The Company is not currently subject to these rules but is continuing to evaluate the Pillar Two Framework and its potential impact on future periods.

 Overview 
 
 Synchronoss Technologies, Inc. Synchronoss or the Company is a leading provider of white label cloud software and services that enable our customers to keep subscribers, systems, networks and content in sync. 
 
 The Synchronoss Personal CloudTM solution is designed to create an engaging and trusted customer experience through ongoing content management and engagement. The Synchronoss Personal CloudTM platform is a secure and highly scalable, white label platform that allows our customers subscribers to backup and protect, engage with, and manage their personal content and gives our operator customers the ability to increase average revenue per user ARPU and reduce churn. 
 
 Our Synchronoss Personal CloudTM platform is specifically designed to support smartphones, tablets, desktops computers, and laptops. 
 
 Synchronoss Messaging platform (Owned and operated through October 31, 2023) had powered mobile messaging and mailboxes for hundreds of millions of telecommunication subscribers. Our Advanced Messaging platform had been a powerful, secure, intelligent, white label messaging platform that expanded capabilities for communications service provider and multi-service providers to offer P2P messaging via Rich Communications Services RCS ). Our Mobile Messaging Platform MMP provided a single standard ecosystem for onboarding and management to brands, advertisers and message wholesalers. 
 
 The Synchronoss NetworkX (Owned and operated through October 31, 2023) products had provided operators with the tools and software to design their physical network, streamlined their infrastructure purchases, and managed and optimized comprehensive network expenses for leading top tier carriers around the globe. 
 
 We market our solutions and services directly through our sales organizations in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa EMEA and Asia-Pacific APAC ). 

Revenues 
 
 We generate most of our revenues on a subscription basis, which is derived from contracts that extend up to 48 months from execution.

 The future success of our business depends on the continued growth of Business-to-Business and Business-to-Business-to-Consumer driving customer transactions, and continued expansion of our platforms into the TMT market globally through cloud markets. As such, the volume of subscribers and our ability to expand our footprint in TMT and globally may result in revenue fluctuations on a quarterly basis. 
 
 Most of our revenues are recorded in U.S. dollars but as we continue to expand our footprint with international carriers, we are subject to currency translation that could affect our future net sales as reported in U.S. dollars. 
 
 The Company s top five customers accounted for 97.9 and 97.4 of net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Contracts with these customers typically run for three to five years. Of these customers, both Verizon and AT T accounted for more than 10 of our revenues in 2024 and 2023. The loss of Verizon or AT T as a customer would have a material negative impact on our company. However, we believe that the costs incurred and subscriber disruption by Verizon or AT T to replace Synchronoss solutions would be substantial. 

Current Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations 
 
 Business from our Synchronoss Personal Cloud solution has been driven by the growth in mobile devices globally that are becoming content rich. As these devices replace other traditional devices like PCs, the ability to securely back up content from mobile devices, sync it with other devices and share it with family, friends and business associates have become an essential need and subscriber expectation. Such devices include smartphones, connected cars, personal health and wellness devices and connected home devices. The need for the content from these devices to be stored in a common cloud is also expected to drive our business in the longer term. 
 
 To support our growth, which we expect to be driven by the favorable industry trends, we plan to leverage modular components from our existing software platforms to build new products. We believe that these opportunities will continue to provide future benefits and position us for future revenue growth. We have focused our product development efforts on expanding the functionality, scalability and security of our products and solutions. We expect to sustain our research and development investments as we intend to continue on an aggressive path to develop new features and functionality, upgrade and extend our product offerings and develop new technology. Our purchase of capital assets and equipment may increase based on aggressive deployment, subscriber growth and promotional offers for free or bundled storage by our major Tier 1 carrier customers. 
 
 We continue to expand our platforms into the converging TMT market to enable connected devices to do more things across multiple networks, brands and communities. Our initiatives with our customers continue to grow both with regard to our current business as well as our new product offerings. We are also exploring additional opportunities to support our customer, product and geographic diversification strategies.

 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 
 The following table presents an overview of our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 2024 vs 2023 Net revenues 42,964 39,790 3,174 Cost of revenues 1 
 8,975 9,478 (503) Research and development 10,333 9,304 1,029 Selling, general and administrative 13,755 20,285 (6,530) Restructuring charges 28 (28) Depreciation and amortization 4,386 4,482 (96) Total costs and expenses 37,449 43,577 (6,128) Income (loss) from operations 5,515 (3,787) 9,302 Interest income 165 149 16 Interest expense (5,526) (3,482) (2,044) Other (expense) income, net (5,241) 4,456 (9,697) (Loss) income from continuing operations, before taxes (5,087) (2,664) (2,423) Provision for income taxes (628) (23) (605) 
 ________________________________ 
 1 Cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization which are shown separately. 
 
 Net revenues increased 3.2 million to 43.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The overall increase in revenue was primarily due to continued cloud subscriber growth, partially offset by 0.9 million higher professional services revenue in the prior year associated with the implementation and launch of SoftBank. 
 
 Cost of revenues decreased 0.5 million to 9.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The 2024 decrease was primarily attributable to the reduced baseline employee costs due to restructuring measures taken in the fourth quarter of 2023, partially offset by higher performance-based compensation expense in the current period due to expected full-year metric attainment compared to the prior period performance. 
 
 Research and development expense increased 1.0 million to 10.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher performance-based compensation expense in the current period due to expected full-year metric attainment compared to the prior period performance, partially offset by reduced baseline employee costs due to restructuring measures taken in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expense decreased 6.5 million to 13.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The 2024 decrease was mainly related to reduced baseline employee costs due to restructuring measures taken in the fourth quarter of 2023, 2.1 million higher non-recurring professional fees incurred in the prior period and 4.8 million impairment of the Note Receivable recorded in the third quarter of 2023. This was partially offset by a higher performance-based compensation expense in the current period due to expected full-year metric attainment compared to the prior period performance. 
 
 Restructuring charges were immaterial for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and immaterial for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Restructuring charges were primarily related to employment termination costs as a result of the work-force reductions initiated to reduce operating costs and align our resources with our key strategic priorities.

 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased immaterially for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 Interest expense increased 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is mainly due to 2.1 million interest expense related to the new Term Loan the Company obtained at the end of the second quarter of 2024, which was used to retire the Series B Preferred stock, improving the Company s overall capital structure. 
 
 Other income (expense), net decreased 9.7 million to expense of 5.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from income of 4.5 million during the same period in 2023 primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange losses on intercompany payables and receivables. 

Income tax. The Company recognized an income tax expense of approximately 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and immaterial amount for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate was approximately (12.3) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to the impact of permanent adjustments including Global Intangible Low-Taxes Income and adjustments to valuation allowances associated with current year activity, partially offset by foreign tax rate differential. The Company s projection of U.S. current income tax expense for the period is driven by the impact of Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income and enacted Internal Revenue Code Section 174 rules that require the Company to capitalize and amortize qualifying research and development expenses and by operating income generated in certain foreign jurisdictions. The Company s effective tax rate was approximately (0.9) for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate due to pre-tax losses in jurisdictions where full valuation allowances have been recorded and certain jurisdictions projecting current income tax expense.

Table of Contents 

 Net revenues increased 6.6 million to 129.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The overall increase in revenue was primarily due to continued cloud subscriber growth, partially offset by 2.0 million higher professional services revenue in the prior year associated with the implementation and launch of SoftBank. 
 
 Cost of revenues decreased 2.3 million to 29.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The 2024 decrease was primarily attributable to reduced baseline employee costs due to restructuring measures taken in the fourth quarter of 2023; partially offset by a higher performance-based compensation expense in the current period due to expected full-year metric attainment compared to the prior period performance. 
 
 Research and development expense decreased 2.8 million to 32.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to reduced baseline employee costs due to restructuring measures taken in the fourth quarter of 2023; partially offset by a higher performance-based compensation expense in the current period due to expected full-year metric attainment compared to the prior period performance. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expense decreased 13.7 million to 39.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to reduced baseline employee costs due to restructuring measures taken in the fourth quarter of 2023, 5.8 million higher non-recurring professional fees incurred in the prior period, and the 4.8 million note receivable impairment recorded in the third quarter of 2023. This was partially offset by a higher performance-based compensation expense in the current period due to the expected full-year metric attainment compared to the prior period performance. 
 
 Restructuring charges were 0.3 million and 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which primarily related to employment termination costs as a result of the work-force reductions initiated to reduce operating costs and align our resources with our key strategic priorities. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 0.3 million to 12.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The 2024 increase was primarily attributable to increased amortization of capitalized software due to more amortizable assets placed in service in the current period. 
 
 Interest expense increased 2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is mainly due to 2.2 million interest expense related to the new Term Loan the Company obtained at the end of the second quarter of 2024, which was used to retire the Series B Preferred stock, improving the Company s overall capital structure. 
 
 Other income (expense), net decreased 1.4 million to expense of 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from income of 1.2 million during the same period in 2023. The 2024 decrease is primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange gains on intercompany payables and receivables. 

Income tax. The Company recognized an income tax expense of approximately 3.9 million and 0.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate was approximately 178.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to the impact of permanent adjustments, most notably Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, partially offset by foreign tax rate differential. The Company s projection of U.S. current income tax expense for the period is driven by the impact of Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income and enacted Internal Revenue Code Section 174 rules that require the Company to capitalize and amortize qualifying research and development expenses and by operating income generated in certain foreign jurisdictions. The Company s effective tax rate was approximately (4.3) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate due to pre-tax losses in jurisdictions where full valuation allowances have been recorded and certain jurisdictions projecting current income tax expense. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 On June 28, 2024, the Company entered into the Credit Agreement with BGC Lender Rep LLC, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto. The Credit Agreement established a senior secured term loan facility of up to 75.0 million, all of which was funded on the Effective Date. The proceeds of the Term Loan were used to (i) fund the Senior Note Repurchase, (ii) 
 40 

Table of Contents 

 to fund the Series B Repurchase and (iii) to pay transaction fees and expenses associated with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement, as discussed in Note 9. Debt of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash provided by operations. Our cash and cash equivalents balance was 25.2 million at September 30, 2024. We anticipate that our principal uses of cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our business, including technology expansion and working capital. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, our non-U.S. subsidiaries held approximately 13.9 million of cash and cash equivalents that are available for use by our operations around the world. 
 
 Our policy has been to leave our cumulative unremitted foreign earnings invested indefinitely outside the United States, and we intend to continue this policy for most of our foreign subsidiaries. During 2023, we changed our indefinite reinvestment assertion for our Indian subsidiary and recorded a deferred tax liability associated with the outside basis difference. The Company continues to assert permanent reinvestment of foreign earnings in all other foreign jurisdictions. Due to the timing and circumstances of repatriation of such earnings, if any, it is not practicable to determine the unrecognized deferred tax liability relating to such amounts. 
 
 We believe that our cash, cash equivalents, financing sources, and our ability to manage working capital and expected positive cash flows generated from operations in combination with continued expense reductions will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months from the filing date of this Form 10-Q based on our current business plans. Our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in the "Forward-Looking Statements" section of this MD A and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, some of which are outside of our control. 
 
 For further details, see Note 9. Debt and Note 11. Capital Structure of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 

Discussion of Cash Flows 
 
 A summary of net cash flows follows (in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 15,205 19,236 Investing activities (9,109) (15,889) Financing activities (5,384) (7,496) 
 
 Our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. The primary uses of cash are personnel and related costs, telecommunications and facility costs related primarily to our cost of revenue and general operating expenses including professional service fees, consulting fees, building and equipment maintenance and marketing expense. 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 15.2 million as compared to 19.2 million of cash provided by operating activities for the same period in 2023 . In the current period, the Company generated cash from operations mainly driven by continued growth in cloud subscribers and reduced operating costs, offset by unfavorable movements in working capital compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 9.1 million as compared to 15.9 million of cash used in investing activities d uring the same period in 2023. The cash used in investing activities during current and prior year primarily funded product development for our Cloud offering and associated labor costs, while last year's expenditures also included investments in Messaging and NetworkX products which were divested in the fourth quarter of 
 41 

Table of Contents 

 2023. In 2024, cash used in investing activities was offset by 1.5 million of deferred consideration for the sale of Messaging and NetworkX Businesses received by the company in the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 5.4 million as compared to 7.5 million of cash used in financing activities during the same period in 2023. The cash used in financing activities in the current year was primarily related to the 75.0 million funding of the Term Loan, offset by 6.8 million issuance costs related to the 2024 Term Loan, 57.6 million Series B Preferred Stock Repurchase, 11.5 million Senior Notes Repurchase and 4.3 million Series B Preferred dividend payments. Cash used in financing activities in the prior year was primarily related to 7.2 million Series B Preferred dividend payments. 

Effect of Inflation 
 
 Inflationary increases in certain input costs, such as occupancy, labor and benefits, and general administrative costs, have impacted our business. Management does not believe these impacts have had a material impact on our results of operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We cannot assure you, however, that we will not be affected by general inflation in the future. 

Contractual Obligations 
 Our contractual obligations consist of office and laptop leases, term loan, notes payable and related interest as well as contractual commitments under third-party hosting, software licenses and maintenance agreements. The following table summarizes our long term contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands): 
 Payments Due by Period Total 2024 2025-2027 2028 Finance lease obligations 1,017 168 849 Interest 46,412 4,528 37,320 4,564 Operating lease obligations 27,655 1,901 21,476 4,278 Purchase obligations 1

 _______________________________ 
 1 Amount represents obligations associated with colocation agreements and other customer delivery related purchase obligations. 

Uncertain Tax Positions 
 
 Unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions were 4.4 million at September 30, 2024. We are not able to reasonably estimate when we would make any cash payments required to settle these liabilities, but we do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations will materially affect our liquidity. It is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately 0.5 million over the next twelve months. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to utilize accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during a fiscal period. The SEC considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to a company s financial condition and results of operations, and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. 
 
 42 

Table of Contents 

 These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable, including but not limited to the potential impacts from current geopolitical tensions. As the extent and duration of the impacts from geopolitical developments remain unclear, the Company s estimates and assumptions may evolve as conditions change. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. If actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates, our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected. See Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Form 10-Q for certain matters bearing risks on our future results of operations. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates discussed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Please refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a more complete discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. 

Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
 
 For a discussion of recently issued accounting standards see Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Consolidation of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 We had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Market Risk 
 
 The following discussion about market risk disclosures involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We deposit our excess cash in what we believe are high-quality financial instruments, primarily money market funds and certificates of deposit and, we may be exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates. These investments are denominated in United States dollars. 
 
 The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations, while at the same time maximizing the income, we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk. To achieve these objectives, our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments in a variety of securities, which could include commercial paper, money market funds and corporate and government debt securities. Our cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were invested in liquid money market accounts and certificates of deposit. All market-risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non-trading purposes. 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 
 We are exposed to translation risk because certain of our foreign operations utilize the local currency as their functional currency and those financial results must be translated into U.S. dollars. As currency exchange rates fluctuate, translation of the financial statements of foreign businesses into U.S. dollars affects the comparability of financial results between years. 
 
 We do not hold any derivative instruments and do not engage in any hedging activities. Although our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, we may conduct business and incur costs in the local currencies of other countries in which we may operate, make sales and buy materials and services. As a result, we are subject to foreign currency transaction risk. Further, changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar could affect our future net sales, cost of sales and expenses and could result in foreign currency transaction gains or losses. 
 
 43 

Table of Contents 

 We cannot accurately predict future exchange rates or the overall impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our business, results of operations and financial condition. To the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future, our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase and hedging activities may be considered if appropriate. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We are exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations on the interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents. A hypothetical 100 basis point movement in interest rates applicable to our cash and cash equivalents outstanding at September 30, 2024 would increase interest income by approximately 0.3 million on an annual basis. 
 
 Borrowings pursuant to the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the applicable interest period, plus 5.50 , subject to a floor of 2.50 , plus Term SOFR adjustment of 0.1 . As such, our net income is sensitive to movements in interest rates. If interest rates increase, our debt obligations pursuant to the Credit Agreement would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income would decrease. Such increases in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and financial condition. We do not hold any derivative instruments and do not engage in any hedging activities to mitigate interest rate risk. 
 
 Based on our outstanding borrowings pursuant to the Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024 a hypothetical 100 basis point movement in interest rates would have affected interest expense on the debt by 0.8 million on an annual basis. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, that ensure that information relating to the registrant which is required to be disclosed in this report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods using the criteria for effective internal control established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 
 In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

 We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our Senior Notes obligations and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our Senior Notes obligations, which may not be successful. 
 
 Our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our Senior Notes, which mature on June 30, 2026. If we fail to generate sufficient cash flows to redeem or repay in full our Senior Notes prior to June 30, 2026, we may have to raise additional funds to pay such amounts on a timely basis. We cannot guarantee that any refinancing of the Senior Notes will be possible on a timely basis, on terms we find acceptable, or at all. 
 
 We may fail to refinance, redeem or repay in full our Senior Notes prior to March 31, 2026, and in that event the maturity date of our Term Loan will be March 31, 2026. 
 
 We entered into the Credit Agreement with BGC Lender Rep LLC, as administrative agent BGC ), and the lenders party thereto on June 28, 2024 (the Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement established a senior secured term loan facility of up to 75.0 million (the Term Loan ), all of which was funded on June 28, 2024. The Term Loan matures on June 28, 2028 (the Maturity Date provided that if (i) the Senior Notes are not refinanced, redeemed or repaid in full prior to March 31, 2026, the Maturity Date shall be March 31, 2026 and (ii) in the event of a refinancing, redemption or repayment of the Senior Notes in full prior to March 31, 2026, the Maturity Date shall be the earlier of (A) June 28, 2028 and (B) the date that is twelve (12) months prior to the final stated maturity date for the indebtedness resulting from such refinancing, redemption or repayment of the Senior Notes in full. 
 
 If we fail to refinance, redeem or repay in full our Senior Notes prior to March 31, 2026, then the Maturity Date will be March 31, 2026, and we will be required to pay all amounts outstanding under the Term Loan sooner than they would otherwise be due, we may not have sufficient funds available to pay such amounts at that time, and we may not be able to raise additional funds to pay such amounts on a timely basis, on terms we find acceptable, or at all. 
 
 The terms of our Credit Agreement restrict our operating and financial flexibility, and any breach of the covenants in that agreement, if the lenders elected to accelerate the due date of the loan, could significantly harm our business and prospects and lead to the liquidation of our business. 
 
 The Credit Agreement contains certain operating covenants and restricts our operating and financial flexibility. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets (other than existing real property). The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants that limit our ability and our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, (i) incur additional indebtedness, (ii) pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments, (iii) sell assets, (iv) make certain investments, (v) grant liens and (vi) enter into transactions with affiliates. These covenants are subject to exceptions and qualifications set forth in the Credit Agreement. The financial covenants set forth in the Credit Agreement include (i) a maximum consolidated secured leverage ratio, which will be tested at the end of each of Synchronoss fiscal quarter and (ii) an average liquidity requirement for any calendar month. We are currently in compliance with the Credit Agreement covenants, but we may fall out of compliance with these covenants. We may also enter into other debt agreements in the future which may contain similar or more restrictive terms.

Upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default, which, for example, could be triggered by a breach or violation of, or default under, certain material contracts of the Company, BGC may take either or both of the following actions: (i) terminate the commitments and (ii) declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and take such other actions as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Any declaration by BGC of an event of default could significantly harm our business and prospects and could cause the price of our common stock to decline significantly. Further, if we were liquidated, the lenders right to repayment would be senior to the rights of our stockholders. 
 
 We have, and in the future may be, the target of stockholder derivative complaints or other securities related legal actions that could adversely affect our results of operations and our business. 
 
 We have, and in the future may be, the target of stockholder derivative complaints or other securities related legal actions. The existence of any litigation may have an adverse effect on our reputation with referral sources and our customers themselves, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The outcome and amount of resources needed to respond to, defend or resolve lawsuits is unpredictable and may remain unknown for long periods of time. Our exposure under these matters may also include our indemnification obligations, to the extent we have any, to current and former officers and directors and, in some cases former underwriters, against losses incurred in connection with these matters, including reimbursement of legal fees and other expenses. For instance, on June 7, 2022, the SEC filed a civil action against two former members of our management team (the defendants ), alleging misconduct arising out of certain restated transactions that took place in 2015 and 2016 investigated by the SEC. We will be required to indemnify the defendants in these actions for certain costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney s fees. As of September 30, 2024, we had paid approximately 7.3 million life to date for costs incurred in these actions. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, the Company has accrued approximately 2.1 million relating to these actions for certain costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney s fees to be paid in the future. Additional amounts may be subject to claims for indemnification for these actions and any future actions. Although we maintain insurance for claims of this nature, our insurance coverage does not apply in all circumstances and may be denied or insufficient to cover the costs related to the class action and stockholder derivative lawsuits. For instance, our insurance coverage was insufficient to cover our indemnification obligations to the defendants. Large indemnity payments, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material impact on our financial position. In addition, future lawsuits or legal claims involving us may increase our insurance premiums, deductibles or co-insurance requirements or otherwise make it more difficult for us to maintain or obtain adequate insurance coverage on acceptable terms, if at all. Moreover, adverse publicity associated with negative developments in any such legal proceedings could decrease customer demand for our services. As a result, future lawsuits involving us, or our officers or directors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and the trading price of our common stock. 
 
 A 1 U.S. federal excise tax may be imposed upon us in connection with the redemptions or repurchases by us of our Series B Non-Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock Series B Preferred Stock or other redemptions or repurchases of our equity. 
 
 On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act IRA , which, among other things, imposes a new U.S. federal 1 excise tax on certain repurchases (including redemptions) of stock by publicly traded domestic corporations and certain domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations. This excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its stockholders from which shares are repurchased. Generally, the amount of the excise tax is 1 of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. For the purposes of calculating the excise tax, the repurchasing corporation is permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of the stock repurchases that occur in the same taxable year. On December 27, 2022, the U.S. Treasury Department issued a notice that provides interim guidance regarding the application of the 1 excise tax pending forthcoming proposed regulations. The IRA excise tax applies to repurchases and redemptions that occur after December 31, 2022. 
 
 We expect that each redemption or repurchase of our equity, such as Series B Preferred Stock repurchases, after December 31, 2022 will be subject to the 1 excise tax. Whether and to what extent we would be subject to the excise tax would depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value of the redemptions and repurchase, (ii) the nature and amount of any equity issuances within the same taxable year and (iii) the regulations and other guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS. For example, on November 3, 2023, we repurchased shares of our outstanding Series B Preferred Stock, pursuant to the Certificate of Designations of the Series B Preferred Stock, which, for the purposes of calculating the excise tax, were offset by the fair market value of new stock issuances in the same taxable year. Additionally, on June 28, 2024,

 we repurchased all outstanding Series B Preferred Stock and following such repurchase filed a certificate of elimination of the Series B Preferred Stock with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The 1 excise tax may increase our costs and impact our operations. This could have an adverse effect on our margins and financial position and would negatively affect our revenues and results of operations and/or trading price of our common stock. The company has accrued for potential exposure related to excise tax as of September 30, 2024.

 2015 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN 
 ARTICLE 1. INTRODUCTION . 
 The Amended and Restated Plan was adopted by the Board on April 22 , 2024, and will become effective immediately upon its approval by the Company s stockholders. The purpose of the Plan is to promote the long-term success of the Company and the creation of stockholder value by (a) encouraging Service Providers to focus on critical long-range objectives, (b) encouraging the attraction and retention of Service Providers with exceptional qualifications and (c) linking Service Providers directly to stockholder interests through increased stock ownership. The Plan seeks to achieve this purpose by providing for Awards in the form of Options (which may be ISOs or NSOs), SARs, Restricted Shares, Stock Units and Performance Cash Awards. Capitalized terms used in this Plan are defined in Article 14. 
 
 ARTICLE 2. ADMINISTRATION . 
 2.1 General . The Plan may be administered by the Board or one or more Committees. Each Committee shall comply with rules and regulations applicable to it, including under the rules of any exchange on which shares of the Company s common stock are traded, and shall have the authority and be responsible for such functions as have been assigned to it. 
 
 2.2 Section 162(m) . To the extent an Award is intended to qualify as performance-based compensation within the meaning of Code Section 162(m), the Plan will be administered by a Committee of two or more outside directors within the meaning of Code Section 162(m). 
 
 2.3 Section 16 . To the extent desirable to qualify transactions hereunder as exempt under Exchange Act Rule 16b-3, the transactions contemplated hereunder will be approved by the entire Board or a Committee of two or more non-employee directors within the meaning of Exchange Act Rule 16b-3. 
 
 2.4 Powers of Administrator . Subject to the terms of the Plan, and in the case of a Committee, subject to the specific duties delegated to the Committee, the Administrator shall have the authority to (a) select the Service Providers who are to receive Awards under the Plan, (b) determine the type, number, vesting requirements and other features and conditions of such Awards, (c) determine whether and to what extent any Performance Goals have been attained, (d) interpret the Plan and Awards granted under the Plan, (e) make, amend and rescind rules relating to the Plan and Awards granted under the Plan, including rules relating to sub-plans established for the purposes of satisfying applicable foreign laws or for qualifying for favorable tax treatment under applicable foreign laws, (f) impose such restrictions, conditions or limitations as it determines appropriate as to the timing and manner of any resales by a Participant of any Common Shares issued pursuant to an Award, including restrictions under an insider trading policy and restrictions as to the use of a specified brokerage firm for such resales, and (g) make all other decisions relating to the operation of the Plan and Awards granted under the Plan. 
 
 2.5 Effect of Administrator s Decisions . The Administrator s decisions, determinations and interpretations shall be final and binding on all Participants and any other holders of Awards. 
 
 2.6 Governing Law . The Plan shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware (except its choice-of-law provisions). 

ARTICLE 3. SHARES AVAILABLE FOR GRANTS . 
 
 3.1 Basic Limitation . Common Shares issued pursuant to the Plan may be authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares.

The number of Common Shares that are subject to Stock Awards outstanding at any time under the Plan may not exceed the number of Common Shares that then remain available for issuance under the Plan. Subject to Section 3.3, the number of Common Shares that may be awarded under the Plan shall be reduced by (a) one share for every Option and SAR granted under the Plan and (b) 1.5 shares for every Award other than an Option or SAR granted under the Plan. The numerical limitations in this Article 3.1 shall be subject to adjustment pursuant to Article 9. 
 
 3.2 Intentionally Omitted . 
 
 3.3 Shares Returned to Reserve .

If Restricted Shares or Common Shares issued upon the exercise of Options are reacquired by the Company pursuant to a forfeiture provision or repurchase right at no greater than their original exercise or purchase price (if any), then such Common Shares shall again become available for issuance under the Plan. Further, to the extent that an Award is settled in cash rather than Common Shares, the cash settlement shall not reduce the number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan. Any Common Shares that again become available for Awards under this Section 3.3 shall be added back as (i) one share if such shares were subject to Options or SARs granted under the Plan and (ii) 1.5 shares if such shares were subject to Awards other than an Option or SAR granted under the Plan 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following Common Shares shall not again become available for issuance under this Article 3.3 (i) Common Shares subject to an Award not delivered to a Participant because the Award is exercised through a reduction of shares subject to the Award (i.e., net exercised ), (ii) if a SAR is settled in Common Shares, the number of shares subject to the SAR that are not delivered to the Participant upon such settlement, (iii) Common Shares subject to an Award not delivered to a Participant because such Common Shares are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations related to the Award or are applied to pay the Exercise Price of an Option or SAR (iv) Common Shares tendered by a Participant (either through actual delivery or attestation) to pay the Exercise Price of an Option or SAR or (v) Common Shares reacquired by the Company on the open market or otherwise using cash proceeds from the exercise of an Option. 
 
 3.4 Awards Not Reducing Share Reserve in Article 3.1 . To the extent permitted under applicable stock exchange listing standards, any dividend equivalents paid or credited under the Plan with respect to Stock Units shall not be applied against the number of Common Shares that may be issued under the Plan, whether or not such dividend equivalents are converted into Stock Units. In addition, Common Shares subject to Substitute Awards granted by the Company shall not reduce the number of Common Shares that may be issued under Article 3.1, nor shall shares subject to Substitute Awards again be available for Awards under the Plan in the event of any forfeiture, expiration or cash settlement of such Substitute Awards. 

3.5 Code Section 162(m) and 422 Limits . Subject to adjustment in accordance with Article 9 
 (a) The maximum aggregate number of Common Shares subject to Options and SARs that may be granted under this Plan during any fiscal year to any one Participant shall not exceed 500,000, except that the Company may grant to a new Employee in the fiscal year in which his or her Service as an Employee first commences Options and or SARs that cover (in the aggregate) up to an additional 150,000 Common Shares 
 (b) The maximum aggregate number of Common Shares subject to Restricted Share awards and Stock Units that may be granted under this Plan during any fiscal year to any one Participant shall not exceed 500,000, except that the Company may grant to a new Employee in the fiscal year in which his or her Service as an Employee first commences Restricted Shares and or Stock Units that cover (in the aggregate) up to an additional 150,000 Common Shares 
 (c) The maximum aggregate number of Common Shares subject to Awards granted to an Outside Director during any fiscal year of the Company shall not exceed 20,000 shares 
 (d) No Participant shall be paid more than 5,000,000 in cash in any fiscal year pursuant to Performance Cash Awards granted under the Plan and 
 (e) No more than 1,000,000 Common Shares may be issued under the Plan upon the exercise of ISOs. 
 
 ARTICLE 4. ELIGIBILITY . 
 4.1 Incentive Stock Options . Only Employees who are common-law employees of the Company, a Parent or a Subsidiary shall be eligible for the grant of ISOs. In addition, an Employee who owns more than 10 of the total combined voting power of all classes of outstanding stock of the Company or any of its Parents or Subsidiaries shall not be eligible for the grant of an ISO unless the additional requirements set forth in Code Section 422(c)(5) are satisfied. 
 
 4.2 Other Awards . Awards other than ISOs may only be granted to Service Providers. 
 
 ARTICLE 5. OPTIONS . 
 5.1 Stock Option Agreement . Each grant of an Option under the Plan shall be evidenced by a Stock Option Agreement between the Optionee and the Company. Such Option shall be subject to all applicable terms of the Plan and may be subject to any other terms that are not inconsistent with the Plan. The Stock Option Agreement shall specify whether the Option is intended to be an ISO or an NSO. The provisions of the various Stock Option Agreements entered into under the Plan need not be identical. 
 
 5.2 Number of Shares . Each Stock Option Agreement shall specify the number of Common Shares subject to the Option, which number shall adjust in accordance with Article 9. 
 
 5.3 Exercise Price . Each Stock Option Agreement shall specify the Exercise Price, which shall be such price as is determined by the Administrator in its discretion provided however , that unless an Option is intended to comply with Code Section 409A (and not, for the avoidance of doubt, be exempt from Code Section 409A) the Exercise Price of any Option granted to a Participant subject to taxation in the United States shall be not be less than 100 of the Fair Market Value of a Common Share on the date of grant provided further that the preceding clause shall not apply to an Option that is a Substitute Award granted in a manner that would satisfy the requirements of Code Section 409A and, if applicable, Code Section 424(a). 
 
 5.4 Exercisability and Term . Each Stock Option Agreement shall specify the date or event when all or any installment of the Option is to become vested and or exercisable provided that with respect to 95 of the shares available for issuance under the Plan on April 4, 2019, the Option shall not become exercisable prior to the Optionee completing at least one year of Service following the grant of such Option. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Stock Option Agreement may provide for accelerated exercisability in the event of the Optionee s death or disability. The Stock Option Agreement shall also specify the term of the Option provided that, except to the extent necessary to comply with applicable foreign law, the term of an Option shall in no event exceed 7 years from the date of grant. 

5.5 Death of Optionee . After an Optionee s death, any vested and exercisable Options held by such Optionee may be exercised by his or her beneficiary or beneficiaries. Each Optionee may designate one or more beneficiaries for this purpose by filing the prescribed form with the Company. A beneficiary designation may be changed by filing the prescribed form with the Company at any time before the Optionee s death. If no beneficiary was designated or if no designated beneficiary survives the Optionee, then any vested and exercisable Options held by the Optionee may be exercised by his or her estate. 
 
 5.6 Modification or Assumption of Options . Within the limitations of the Plan, the Administrator may modify, extend or assume outstanding options or may accept the cancellation of outstanding options (whether granted by the Company or by another issuer) in return for the grant of new Options for the same or a different number of shares and at the same or a different exercise price or in return for the grant of a different type of Award. The foregoing notwithstanding, no modification of an Option shall, without the consent of the Optionee, impair his or her rights or obligations under such Option. Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, and except for the adjustment provided in Article 9, neither the Committee nor any other person may (a) decrease the exercise price of any outstanding Option after the date of grant, (b) cancel or allow an Optionee to surrender an outstanding Option to the Company in exchange for cash or as consideration for the grant of a new Option with a lower exercise price or the grant of another Award the effect of which is to reduce the exercise price of any outstanding Option, or (c) take any other action with respect to an Option that would be treated as a repricing under the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Stock Market (or such other principal U.S. national securities exchange on which the Common Shares are traded). 
 
 5.7 Buyout Provisions . Except to the extent prohibited by Article 5.6, the Administrator may at any time (a) offer to buy out for a payment in cash or cash equivalents an Option previously granted or (b) authorize an Optionee to elect to cash out an Option previously granted, in either case at such time and based upon such terms and conditions as the Administrator shall establish. 
 
 5.8 Payment for Option Shares . The entire Exercise Price of Common Shares issued upon exercise of Options shall be payable in cash or cash equivalents at the time when such Common Shares are purchased. In addition, the Administrator may, in its sole discretion and to the extent permitted by applicable law, accept payment of all or a portion of the Exercise Price through any one or a combination of the following forms or methods 
 (a) Subject to any conditions or limitations established by the Administrator, by surrendering, or attesting to the ownership of, Common Shares that are already owned by the Optionee with a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Common Shares as to which such Option will be exercised 
 (b) By delivering (on a form prescribed by the Company) an irrevocable direction to a securities broker approved by the Company to sell all or part of the Common Shares being purchased under the Plan and to deliver all or part of the sales proceeds to the Company 
 (c) Subject to such conditions and requirements as the Administrator may impose from time to time, through a net exercise procedure or 
 (d) Through any other form or method consistent with applicable laws, regulations and rules. 
 
 ARTICLE 6. STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS . 
 6.1 SAR Agreement . Each grant of a SAR under the Plan shall be evidenced by a SAR Agreement between the Optionee and the Company. Such SAR shall be subject to all applicable terms of the Plan and may be subject to any other terms that are not inconsistent with the Plan. The provisions of the various SAR Agreements entered into under the Plan need not be identical. 
 
 6.2 Number of Shares . Each SAR Agreement shall specify the number of Common Shares to which the SAR pertains, which number shall adjust in accordance with Article 9. 

6.3 Exercise Price . Each SAR Agreement shall specify the Exercise Price, which shall in no event be less than 100 of the Fair Market Value of a Common Share on the date of grant. The preceding sentence shall not apply to a SAR that is a Substitute Award granted in a manner that would satisfy the requirements of Code Section 409A. 
 
 6.4 Exercisability and Term . Each SAR Agreement shall specify the date when all or any installment of the SAR is to become vested and exercisable provided that with respect to 95 of the shares available for issuance under the Plan on April 4, 2019, the SAR shall not become exercisable prior to the Optionee completing at least one year of Service following the grant of such SAR. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a SAR Agreement may provide for accelerated exercisability in the event of the Optionee s death or disability. The SAR Agreement shall also specify the term of the SAR provided that except to the extent necessary to comply with applicable foreign law, the term of a SAR shall not exceed 7 years from the date of grant. 
 
 6.5 Exercise of SARs . Upon exercise of a SAR, the Optionee (or any person having the right to exercise the SAR after his or her death) shall receive from the Company (a) Common Shares, (b) cash or (c) a combination of Common Shares and cash, as the Administrator shall determine. The amount of cash and or the Fair Market Value of Common Shares received upon exercise of SARs shall, in the aggregate, not exceed the amount by which the Fair Market Value (on the date of surrender) of the Common Shares subject to the SARs exceeds the Exercise Price. If, on the date when a SAR expires, the Exercise Price is less than the Fair Market Value on such date but any portion of such SAR has not been exercised or surrendered, then such SAR shall automatically be deemed to be exercised as of such date with respect to such portion. A SAR Agreement may also provide for an automatic exercise of the SAR on an earlier date. 
 6.6 Death of Optionee . After an Optionee s death, any vested and exercisable SARs held by such Optionee may be exercised by his or her beneficiary or beneficiaries. Each Optionee may designate one or more beneficiaries for this purpose by filing the prescribed form with the Company. A beneficiary designation may be changed by filing the prescribed form with the Company at any time before the Optionee s death. If no beneficiary was designated or if no designated beneficiary survives the Optionee, then any vested and exercisable SARs held by the Optionee at the time of his or her death may be exercised by his or her estate. 
 
 6.7 Modification or Assumption of SARs . Within the limitations of the Plan, the Administrator may modify, extend or assume outstanding SARs or may accept the cancellation of outstanding SARs (whether granted by the Company or by another issuer) in return for the grant of new SARs for the same or a different number of shares and at the same or a different exercise price or in return for the grant of a different type of Award. The foregoing notwithstanding, no modification of a SAR shall, without the consent of the Optionee, impair his or her rights or obligations under such SAR.

 ARTICLE 7. RESTRICTED SHARES . 
 7.1 Restricted Stock Agreement . Each grant of Restricted Shares under the Plan shall be evidenced by a Restricted Stock Agreement between the recipient and the Company. Such Restricted Shares shall be subject to all applicable terms of the Plan and may be subject to any other terms that are not inconsistent with the Plan. The provisions of the various Restricted Stock Agreements entered into under the Plan need not be identical. 

7.2 Payment for Awards . Restricted Shares may be sold or awarded under the Plan for such consideration as the Administrator may determine, including (without limitation) cash, cash equivalents, property, cancellation of other equity awards, full-recourse promissory notes, past services and future services, and such other methods of payment as are permitted by applicable law. 
 
 7.3 Vesting Conditions . Each Award of Restricted Shares shall be subject to vesting and or other conditions as the Administrator may determine provided that, the Restricted Shares will not vest prior to the holder completing at least one year of Service following the grant of such Award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Restricted Stock Agreement may provide for accelerated exercisability in the event of the holder s death or disability. Vesting shall occur, in full or in installments, upon satisfaction of the conditions specified in the Restricted Stock Agreement. Such conditions, at the Administrator s discretion, may include one or more Performance Goals. 
 
 7.4 Voting and Dividend Rights . The holders of Restricted Shares awarded under the Plan shall have the same voting, dividend and other rights as the Company s other stockholders, unless the Administrator otherwise provides. A Restricted Stock Agreement, however, shall require that any cash dividends paid on Restricted Shares (a) be accumulated and paid when such Restricted Shares vest, or (b) be invested in additional Restricted Shares. Such additional Restricted Shares shall be subject to the same conditions and restrictions as the shares subject to the Stock Award with respect to which the dividends were paid. If any dividends or other distributions are paid in Common Shares, such Common Shares shall be subject to the same restrictions on transferability, vesting conditions and forfeitability as the Restricted Shares with respect to which they were paid. 
 
 ARTICLE 8. STOCK UNITS . 
 8.1 Stock Unit Agreement . Each grant of Stock Units under the Plan shall be evidenced by a Stock Unit Agreement between the recipient and the Company. Such Stock Units shall be subject to all applicable terms of the Plan and may be subject to any other terms that are not inconsistent with the Plan. The provisions of the various Stock Unit Agreements entered into under the Plan need not be identical. 
 
 8.2 Payment for Awards . To the extent that an Award is granted in the form of Stock Units, no cash consideration shall be required of the Award recipients. 
 
 8.3 Vesting Conditions . Each Award of Stock Units shall be subject to vesting, as determined by the Administrator. Vesting shall occur, in full or in installments, upon satisfaction of the conditions specified in the Stock Unit Agreement provided that no portion of the Award shall vest earlier than the first anniversary of the date on which the Award is granted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Stock Unit Agreement may provide for accelerated exercisability in the event of the holder s death or disability. Such conditions, at the Administrator s discretion, may include one or more Performance Goals. 
 
 8.4 Voting and Dividend Rights . The holders of Stock Units shall have no voting rights. Prior to settlement or forfeiture, Stock Units awarded under the Plan may, at the Administrator s discretion, provide for a right to dividend equivalents. Such right entitles the holder to be credited with an amount equal to all cash dividends paid on one Common Share while the Stock Unit is outstanding. Dividend equivalents shall be converted into additional Stock Units. Settlement of dividend equivalents may be made in the form of cash, in the form of Common Shares, or in a combination of both. If any dividend equivalents are paid with respect to Stock Units, then such dividend equivalents shall be subject to the same conditions, vesting schedule and restrictions as the Stock Units to which they attach. 

8.5 Form and Time of Settlement of Stock Units . Settlement of vested Stock Units may be made in the form of (a) cash, (b) Common Shares or (c) any combination of both, as determined by the Administrator. The actual number of Stock Units eligible for settlement may be larger or smaller than the number included in the original Award, based on predetermined performance factors, including Performance Goals. Methods of converting Stock Units into cash may include (without limitation) a method based on the average Fair Market Value of Common Shares over a series of trading days. Vested Stock Units shall be settled in such manner and at such time(s) as specified in the Stock Unit Agreement. Until an Award of Stock Units is settled, the number of such Stock Units shall be subject to adjustment pursuant to Article 9. 
 
 8.6 Death of Recipient . Any Stock Units that become payable after the recipient s death shall be distributed to the recipient s beneficiary or beneficiaries. Each recipient of Stock Units under the Plan may designate one or more beneficiaries for this purpose by filing the prescribed form with the Company. A beneficiary designation may be changed by filing the prescribed form with the Company at any time before the Award recipient s death. If no beneficiary was designated or if no designated beneficiary survives the Award recipient, then any Stock Units that become payable after the recipient s death shall be distributed to the recipient s estate. 
 8.7 Modification or Assumption of Stock Units . Within the limitations of the Plan, the Administrator may modify or assume outstanding stock units or may accept the cancellation of outstanding stock units (whether granted by the Company or by another issuer) in return for the grant of new Stock Units for the same or a different number of shares or in return for the grant of a different type of Award. The foregoing notwithstanding, no modification of a Stock Unit shall, without the consent of the Participant, impair his or her rights or obligations under such Stock Unit. 
 
 8.8 Creditors Rights . A holder of Stock Units shall have no rights other than those of a general creditor of the Company. Stock Units represent an unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Company, subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Stock Unit Agreement. 
 
 ARTICLE 9. ADJUSTMENTS DISSOLUTIONS AND LIQUIDATIONS CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS . 
 9.1 Adjustments . In the event of a subdivision of the outstanding Common Shares, a declaration of a dividend payable in Common Shares, a combination or consolidation of the outstanding Common Shares (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of Common Shares or any other increase or decrease in the number of issued Common Shares effected without receipt of consideration by the Company, proportionate adjustments shall automatically be made to the following 
 (a) The number and kind of shares available for issuance under Article 3, including the numerical share limits in Articles 3.1 and 3.5 
 (b) The number and kind of shares covered by each outstanding Option, SAR and Stock Unit or 
 (c) The Exercise Price applicable to each outstanding Option and SAR, and the repurchase price, if any, applicable to Restricted Shares. 
 In the event of a declaration of an extraordinary dividend payable in a form other than Common Shares in an amount that has a material effect on the price of Common Shares, a recapitalization, a spin-off or a similar occurrence, the Administrator may make such adjustments as it, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate to the foregoing. Any adjustment in the number of shares subject to an Award under this Article 9.1 shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share, although the Administrator in its sole discretion may make a cash payment in lieu of a fractional share. Except as provided in this Article 9, a Participant shall have no rights by reason of any issuance by the Company of stock of any class or securities convertible into stock of any class, any subdivision or consolidation of shares of stock of any class, the payment of any stock dividend or any other increase or decrease in the number of shares of stock of any class. 
 
 9.2 Dissolution or Liquidation . To the extent not previously exercised or settled, Options, SARs and Stock Units shall terminate immediately prior to the dissolution or liquidation of the Company. 

9.3 Corporate Transactions . In the event that the Company is a party to a merger, consolidation, or a Change in Control (other than one described in Article 14.6(d)), all Common Shares acquired under the Plan and all Awards outstanding on the effective date of the transaction shall be treated in the manner described in the definitive transaction agreement (or, in the event the transaction does not entail a definitive agreement to which the Company is party, in the manner determined by the Administrator (in accordance with this Article 9.3), with such determination having final and binding effect on all parties), which agreement or determination need not treat all Awards (or portions thereof) in an identical manner. The treatment specified in the transaction agreement or by the Administrator shall include one or more of the following with respect to each outstanding Award 
 (a) The continuation of such outstanding Award by the Company (if the Company is the surviving entity) 
 (b) The assumption of such outstanding Award by the surviving entity or its parent, provided that the assumption of an Option or a SAR shall comply with applicable tax requirements 
 (c) The substitution by the surviving entity or its parent of an equivalent award for such outstanding Award (including, but not limited to, an award to acquire the same consideration paid to the holders of Common Shares in the transaction), provided that the substitution of an Option or a SAR shall comply with applicable tax requirements 
 (d) If outstanding Awards, Options and SARs are not assumed, or equivalent awards are not substituted, by the surviving entity or its parent, then full exercisability and full vesting (with respect to performance vested Awards, Options or SARs, assuming the achievement of the maximum performance targets thereunder) of the Common Shares subject to such Awards, Options and SARs, followed by the cancellation of such Awards, Options and SARs. The full exercisability of such Awards, Options and SARs and full vesting of such Common Shares maybe contingent on the closing of such transaction. The Optionees shall be able to exercise such Options and SARs during a period of not less than five full business days preceding the closing date of such transaction, unless (i) a shorter period is required to permit a timely closing of such merger, consolidation or Change in Control and (ii) such shorter period still offers the Optionees a reasonable opportunity to exercise such Options and SARs. Any exercise of such Options and SARs during such period maybe contingent on the closing of such transaction 
 (e) The cancellation of such Award and a payment to the Participant with respect to each share subject to the Award equal to the excess of (A) the value, as determined by the Administrator in its absolute discretion, of the property (including cash) received by the holder of a Common Share as a result of the transaction, over (if applicable) (B) the per-share Exercise Price of such Award (such excess, if any, the Spread ). Such payment may be made in installments and may be deferred until the date or dates when such Award would have become exercisable or the Common Shares subject to such Award would have vested. Such payment may be subject to vesting based on the Participant s continuing Service, provided that the vesting schedule shall not be less favorable to the Participant than the schedule under which such Award would have become exercisable or such Common Shares subject to such Award would have vested. Such payment shall be made in the form of cash, cash equivalents, or securities of the surviving entity or its parent having a value equal to the Spread. In addition, any escrow, holdback, earn-out or similar provisions in the transaction agreement may apply to such payment to the same extent and in the same manner as such provisions apply to the holders of Common Shares, but only to the extent the application of such provisions does not adversely affect the status of the Award as exempt from Code Section 409A. If the Spread applicable to an Award (whether or not vested) is zero or a negative number, then the Award may be cancelled without making a payment to the Participant. In the event that a Stock Unit or other Award is subject to Code Section 409A, the payment described in this clause (e) shall be made on the settlement date specified in the applicable Stock Unit Agreement, provided that settlement may be accelerated in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4). For purposes of this Subsection (e), the Fair Market Value of any security shall be determined without regard to any vesting conditions that may apply to such security or 
 (f) The assignment of any reacquisition or repurchase rights held by the Company in respect of an Award of Restricted Shares to the surviving entity or its parent, with corresponding proportionate adjustments made to the price per share to be paid upon exercise of any such reacquisition or repurchase rights. 
 For avoidance of doubt, the Administrator shall have the discretion to provide for the acceleration of vesting upon the occurrence of a Change in Control in the event of an involuntary termination prior to or 

following the Change in Control, whether or not the Award is to be assumed or replaced in the transaction, or in connection with a termination of the Participant s Service following a transaction. 
 Any action taken under this Article 9.3 shall either preserve an Award s status as exempt from Code Section 409A or comply with Code Section 409A. 
 
 ARTICLE 10. OTHER AWARDS .

Notwithstanding the foregoing, an award agreement may provide for accelerated exercisability in the event of the holder s death or disability. Such Common Shares shall be treated for all purposes under the Plan like Common Shares issued in settlement of Stock Units and shall, when issued, reduce the number of Common Shares available under Article 3. 
 
 ARTICLE 11. LIMITATION ON RIGHTS . 
 11.1 Retention Rights . Neither the Plan nor any Award granted under the Plan shall be deemed to give any individual a right to remain a Service Provider.

 11.2 Stockholders Rights . Except as set forth in Article 7.4 or 8.4 above, a Participant shall have no dividend rights, voting rights or other rights as a stockholder with respect to any Common Shares covered by his or her Award prior to the time when a stock certificate for such Common Shares is issued or, if applicable, the time when he or she becomes entitled to receive such Common Shares by filing any required notice of exercise and paying any required Exercise Price. No adjustment shall be made for cash dividends or other rights for which the record date is prior to such time, except as expressly provided in the Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, no dividends or dividend equivalents will be paid or credited to an unexercised Option or SAR. 
 
 11.3 Regulatory Requirements . Any other provision of the Plan notwithstanding, the obligation of the Company to issue Common Shares under the Plan shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules and regulations and such approval by any regulatory body as may be required. The Company reserves the right to restrict, in whole or in part, the delivery of Common Shares pursuant to any Award prior to the satisfaction of all legal requirements relating to the issuance of such Common Shares, to their registration, qualification or listing or to an exemption from registration, qualification or listing. The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed necessary by the Company s counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Common Shares hereunder, will relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Common Shares as to which such requisite authority will not have been obtained. 

11.4 Transferability of Awards . The Administrator may, in its sole discretion, permit transfer of an Award in a manner consistent with applicable law. Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, Awards shall be transferable by a Participant only by (a) beneficiary designation, (b) a will or (c) the laws of descent and distribution provided that, in any event, an ISO may only be transferred by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and may be exercised during the lifetime of the Optionee only by the Optionee or by the Optionee s guardian or legal representative. In no event may an Award be transferred for any consideration including (without limitation) in exchange for cash or securities. 
 
 11.5 Other Conditions and Restrictions on Common Shares . Any Common Shares issued under the Plan shall be subject to such forfeiture conditions, rights of repurchase, rights of first refusal, other transfer restrictions and such other terms and conditions as the Administrator may determine.

In addition, Common Shares issued under the Plan shall be subject to such conditions and restrictions imposed either by applicable law or by Company policy, as adopted from time to time, designed to ensure compliance with applicable law or laws with which the Company determines in its sole discretion to comply including in order to maintain any statutory, regulatory or tax advantage. 
 
 ARTICLE 12. TAXES . 
 12.1 General . It is a condition to each Award under the Plan that a Participant or his or her successor shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the satisfaction of any federal, state, local or foreign withholding tax obligations that arise in connection with any Award granted under the Plan. The Company shall not be required to issue any Common Shares or make any cash payment under the Plan unless such obligations are satisfied. 
 
 12.2 Share Withholding . To the extent that applicable law subjects a Participant to tax withholding obligations, the Administrator may permit such Participant to satisfy all or part of such obligations by having the Company withhold all or a portion of any Common Shares that otherwise would be issued to him or her or by surrendering all or a portion of any Common Shares that he or she previously acquired. Such Common Shares shall be valued on the date when they are withheld or surrendered. Any payment of taxes by assigning Common Shares to the Company may be subject to restrictions including any restrictions required by SEC, accounting or other rules. 
 
 12.3 Section 162(m) Matters . The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may determine whether an Award is intended to qualify as performance-based compensation within the meaning of Code Section 162(m). The Administrator may grant Awards that are based on Performance Goals but that are not intended to qualify as performance-based compensation. With respect to any Award that is intended to qualify as performance-based compensation, the Administrator shall designate the Performance Goal(s) applicable to, and the formula for calculating the amount payable under, an Award within 90 days following commencement of the applicable Performance Period (or such earlier time as may be required under Code Section 162(m)), and in any event at a time when achievement of the applicable Performance Goal(s) remains substantially uncertain. Prior to the payment of any Award that is intended to constitute performance-based compensation, the Administrator shall certify in writing whether and the extent to which the Performance Goal(s) were achieved for such Performance Period. The Administrator shall have the right to reduce or eliminate (but not to increase) the amount payable under an Award that is intended to constitute performance-based compensation. 
 
 12.4 Section 409A Matters . Except as otherwise expressly set forth in an Award Agreement, it is intended that Awards granted under the Plan either be exempt from, or comply with, the requirements of Code Section 409A. To the extent an Award is subject to Code Section 409A (a 409A Award ), the terms of the Plan, the Award and any written agreement governing the Award shall be interpreted to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A so that the Award is not subject to additional tax or interest under Code 

Section 409A, unless the Administrator expressly provides otherwise. A 409A Award shall be subject to such additional rules and requirements as specified by the Administrator from time to time in order for it to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A. In this regard, if any amount under a 409A Award is payable upon a separation from service to an individual who is considered a specified employee (as each term is defined under Code Section 409A), then no such payment shall be made prior to the date that is the earlier of (i) six months and one day after the Participant s separation from service or (ii) the Participant s death, but only to the extent such delay is necessary to prevent such payment from being subject to Code Section 409A(a)(1). 
 
 12.5 Limitation on Liability . Neither the Company nor any person serving as Administrator shall have any liability to a Participant in the event an Award held by the Participant fails to achieve its intended characterization under applicable tax law.

 13.2 Amendment or Termination . The Board may, at any time and for any reason, amend or terminate the Plan. No Awards shall be granted under the Plan after the termination thereof.

 13.3 Stockholder Approval . To the extent required by applicable law, the Plan will be subject to the approval of the Company s stockholders within 12 months of its adoption date.

(It will expire earlier if your Service terminates, as described below.) 
 
 Regular Termination If your Service terminates for any reason except death or total and permanent disability, then this option will expire at the close of business at Company headquarters on the date three months after your termination date. The Company determines when your Service terminates for this purpose. 
 Death If you die before your Service terminates, then this option will expire at the close of business at Company headquarters on the date 12 months after the date of death. 
 Disability If your Service terminates because of your total and permanent disability, then this option will expire at the close of business at Company headquarters on the date 12 months after your termination date.

Leaves of Absence and Part-Time Work F or purposes of this grant, your Service does not terminate when you go on a military leave, a sick leave or another bona fide leave of absence, if the leave was approved by the Company in writing and if continued crediting of Service is required by applicable law, the Company s written leave of absence policy (as in effect for similarly situated employees) or the terms of your leave.

 Your personal check, a cashier s check or a money order. 
 Certificates for shares of Company stock that you own, along with any forms needed to effect a transfer of those shares to the Company.

With the Company s consent, these arrangements may include withholding shares of Company stock that otherwise would be issued to you when you exercise this option. The value of these shares, determined as of the effective date of the option exercise, will be applied to the withholding taxes. 
 
 Restrictions on Resale You agree not to sell any option shares at a time when applicable laws, Company policies or an agreement between the Company and its underwriters prohibit a sale. This restriction will apply as long as your Service continues and for such period of time after the termination of your Service as the Company may specify. 

Transfer of Option Prior to your death, only you may exercise this option. You cannot transfer or assign this option. For instance, you may not sell this option or use it as security for a loan. If you attempt to do any of these things, this option will immediately become invalid. You may, however, dispose of this option in your will or a beneficiary designation. 
 
 Regardless of any marital property settlement agreement, the Company is not obligated to honor a notice of exercise from your former spouse, nor is the Company obligated to recognize your former spouse s interest in your option in any other way. 
 Retention Rights Your option or this Agreement does not give you the right to be retained by the Company or a subsidiary of the Company in any capacity. The Company and its subsidiaries reserve the right to terminate your Service at any time, with or without cause. 
 
 Stockholder Rights You, or your estate or heirs, have no rights as a stockholder of the Company until you have exercised this option by giving the required notice to the Company and paying the exercise price.

 January 1 to December 31 each year 
 
 D. Change of Control 
 
 In the event a Change of Control occurs in 2024, PBCUs for 2024, 2025 and 2026 shall be deemed to be earned at target. If the Change of Control occurs in 2025, the individual shall receive the actual number of PBCUs earned for 2024 based on 2024 performance, and PBCUs for 2025 and 2026 shall be deemed to be earned at target. If the Change of Control occurs in 2026, the individual shall receive the actual number of PBCUs earned in 2024 and 2025 based on 2024 and 2025 performances, respectfully, and PBCUs for 2026 shall be deemed to be earned at target. 
 
 The value of the 2024 PBCUs shall vest immediately and be paid out within thirty (30) days following the closing of the Change of Control. The target value of the 2025 and 2026 PBCUs shall, at the option of the acquiror, (i) vest immediately and be paid out within thirty (30) days following the closing of the Change of Control (ii) vest and be paid out in accordance with the original Vesting Provision, subject to the individual s continued service to the acquiror through each applicable payment date or (iii) convert to an equivalent value of shares in the acquiror. In the event an individual with a Tier One or Key Executive Agreement is terminated within 120 days prior 

to or 24 months subsequent to a Change of Control, all PBCUs are converted to cash and paid at the later of thirty (30) days following the closing of the Change of Control or upon termination of the individual. 
 
 E. Vesting Period 
 
 In the absence of change in control, 100 of the PBCUs vest on the date the Compensation Committee meets to approve the actual number of units earned, which date shall be after the 
 
 financial results for 2026 are approved by the Board (after the Company s year-end earnings call, which is expected to be on or about March 15, 2027). The value of the performance-based cash units shall be determined by taking the total number of units earned during the performance period and multiplying them by the closing stock price on the Vesting Date. 
 
 F. Conversion to Equity 
 
 Prior to granting the actual number of PBCUs after the 2026 financial performance is determined, the Compensation Committee may issue shares of the Company s common stock (under the Company s Amended 2015 Equity Incentive Plan) in lieu of cash in the amount equal to the quotient of (i) the value of the PBCUs to be earned by the individual as determined above based on the financial performance of the Company in 2024, 2025 and 2026 divided by (ii) the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date the Compensation Committee meets to approve the actual grants as provided above. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Compensation Committee shall have sole discretion to determine the value of PBCUs to be distributed in cash or the value to be distributed in shares of the Company s common stock or any combination of the two.
