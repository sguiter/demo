financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Two Hands Corporation (the "Company") was
incorporated in the state of Delaware on April 3, 2009 and on July 26, 2016, changed its name from Innovative Product Opportunities Inc.
to Two Hands Corporation. 

The Two Hands co-parenting
 application launched on July 2018 and the Two Hands Gone application
 launched In February 2019. The Company ceased work on
these applications in 2021. 

The gocart.city online consumer grocery delivery application
was released in early June 2020 and Cuore Food Services commenced sale of dry goods and produce to other businesses in July 2020. 

In July 2021,
the Company made the strategic decision to focus exclusively on the grocery market through three on-demand branches of its grocery
businesses: gocart.city, Grocery Originals, and Cuore Food Services. All three of such branches of the Company s business share
industry standard warehouse storage space and inventory. The Company s inventory is updated continuously and generally consists
of produce, meats, pantry items, bakery pastry goods, gluten-free goods, and organic items, acquired from various different suppliers
in Canada and internationally, with whom the Company and its principals have cultivated long-term relationships. 

On May 1, 2023, the Company sold its gocarty.city
and Grocery Originals branches. 

Cuore Food Services 

 Cuore Food Services is the Company s wholesale
food distribution branch. Cuore Food Services uses inventory from the Company s warehouse as well as inventory it acquires on an
ad hoc basis, and focuses on bulk delivery of goods to food service business such as restaurants, hotels, event planning/hosting businesses.
Orders distributed through Cuore Food Services can be made over the phone or online through a different front-end of the gocart.city platform. 

The Company continued Cuore Food Services after May
1, 2023. 

Management's Plan of Operation 

The Company is focused exclusively on the grocery
market through its on-demand grocery business: Cuore Food Services. 

Products and Services 

The Company plans to continue expanding its reach to additional customers
and geographies across Canada while enhancing its product line with a focus on Italian staples, including pasta, oils, olives, and canned
tomatoes. 

Operations and Logistics 

The company plans to expand storage and warehousing,
expand warehouse staff, add more delivery trucks and expand the delivery area. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements and related
disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited
to, the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts, inventories, impairment of long-term assets, stock-based compensation, derivatives,
income taxes and loss contingencies. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

19 

We believe the following critical accounting policies,
among others, may be impacted significantly by judgment, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the Financial Statements: 

NET LOSS PER SHARE 

Basic net income (loss) per share includes no dilution
and is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
for the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding for the period increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding
if potentially dilutive securities had been issued. Dilutive net loss per share for common stock is calculated utilizing the if-converted
method which assumes the conversion of all Series C Stock to common stock. On September 30, 2024 and 2023, we excluded the common stock
issuable upon conversion of non-redeemable convertible notes, and Series C Stock of 4,266,441,800 shares and 5,039,499,100 shares, respectively,
as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. 

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 

The Company accounts for stock incentive awards issued
to employees and non-employees in accordance with FASB ASC 718, Stock Compensation. Accordingly, stock-based compensation is measured
at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award. Stock-based awards to employees are recognized as an expense over the requisite
service period, or upon the occurrence of certain vesting events. Additionally, stock-based awards to non-employees are expensed over
the period in which the related services are rendered. 

REVENUE RECOGNITION 

In accordance with ASC 606, revenue is recognized
when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which we
expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods or services. The provisions of ASC 606 include a five-step process by which
we determine revenue recognition, depicting the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts reflecting the payment to which
we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASC 606 requires us to apply the following steps: (1) identify the contract
with the customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction
price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when, or as, we satisfy the performance obligation. We
recognize revenue for the sale of our products upon delivery to a customer. 

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt Debt
with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic
815-40). This update amends the guidance on convertible instruments and the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity's own
equity and improves and amends the related EPS guidance for both Subtopics. This standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods
within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, which means it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1,
2024. The Company recognizes there will be an impact on how conversions are calculated which may require recognition of gains or losses.
However, the Company believes, through their evaluation, there is no material impact this new guidance will have on its financial statements. 

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07,
Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (Topic 280). This ASU updates reportable segment disclosure requirements by requiring disclosures
of significant reportable segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM and
included within each reported measure of a segment s profit or loss. This ASU also requires disclosure of the title and position
of the individual identified as the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of a segment s profit or
loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Adoption of the ASU should be applied retrospectively
to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is also permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the
provisions of the amendments and the impact on its financial statements. 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09,
Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740). The ASU requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity s effective
tax rate reconciliation as well as additional information on income taxes paid. The ASU is effective on a prospective basis for annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is also permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued
or made available for issuance. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of the amendments and the impact on its financial statements. 

Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by
the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange
Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company's present or future consolidated financial
statements.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the
Company received 190,976 (CAD 259,831) in cash from its line of credit with The Cellular Connection Ltd. dated April 14, 2022, and cash
advances from related party of 36,316. The cash advances are non-interest bearing, unsecured and have no specific terms of repayment. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 11,958,
working capital (deficiency) of (2,535,074) and total liabilities of 3,342,038.

The Company is continuing to focus improving cash
flows from operations by reducing incentives to customers, by making purchases from different suppliers, accelerating the collection of
accounts receivable, reducing expenses, managing accounts payable balances and by paying our officers, directors, consultants and staff
with our stock. 

The Company s financial statements have been
prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities
in the normal course of business. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of 1,610,304 and used
cash in operating activities of 239,157, and on September 30, 2024, had stockholders deficit of 3,250,719 and an accumulated
deficit of 93,696,482. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern within one year of the date that the financial statements are issued. The Company s independent registered public accounting
firm, in their report on the Company s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, contains an explanatory paragraph
regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Over the next 12 months we expect to spend approximately
 368,000 in cash for operations, legal, accounting and related services and to implement our business plan. We hope to be able to compensate
our independent contractors with stock-based compensation, which will not require us to use our cash, although there can be no assurances
that we will be successful in these efforts.

On April 14, 2022, the Company entered into a binding
Line of Credit with The Cellular Connection Ltd. Pursuant to the Line of Credit, the Company can borrow from the Lender up to CAD 0 (CAD
 750,000 available on the Line of Credit less CAD 1,040,168 of funds drawn and outstanding on September 30, 2024) in principal. The outstanding
principal and all accrued interest became due and payable in full on May 1, 2024, the maturity date of the Line of Credit. The Lender
has provided verbal assurances that the Company may continue to borrow additional funds at the same terms as the Line of Credit. From
October 1, 2024 to November 6, 2024, the Company received cash advances of 3,836 (CAD 5,183) from the Lender. There is no guarantee
that the Lender will continue to advance cash to the Company. If required, we expect to be able to secure additional capital through advances
from our Chief Executive Officer, note holders, shareholders and others in order to pay expenses such as organizational costs, filing
fees, accounting fees and legal fees, however, we do not have any written or oral agreements with any other third parties which require
them to fund our operations. Although there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain such funds in the future, the Company
has been able to secure financing to continue operations since its inception on April 3, 2009. We are currently quoted on OTC Pink.. If
we need additional capital in the next twelve months and if we cannot raise such capital on acceptable terms, we may have to curtail our
operations or terminate our business entirely. 

The inability to obtain financing or generate sufficient
cash from operations could require us to reduce or eliminate expenditures for developing products and services, or otherwise curtail or
discontinue our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Furthermore, to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of
such securities may result in dilution to existing stockholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities,
these securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to holders of our common stock and the terms of such debt could impose
restrictions on our operations. Regardless of whether our cash assets prove to be inadequate to meet our operational needs, we may seek
to compensate providers of services by issuing stock in lieu of cash, which may also result in dilution to existing stockholders. 

Our common stock started trading over the counter
and has been quoted on the Over-The Counter Bulletin Board since February 17, 2011. The stock currently trades under the symbol TWOH.OB.

OPERATING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS 

We are currently funding our operations by way of
cash advances from our Chief Executive Officer, note holders, shareholders and others. We hope to be able to compensate our independent
contractors with stock-based compensation, which will not require us to use our cash, although there can be no assurances that we will
be successful in these efforts. On April 14, 2022, the Company entered into a binding Line of Credit with The Cellular Connection Ltd.
Pursuant to the Line of Credit, the Company can borrow from the Lender up to CAD 0 (CAD 750,000 available on the Line of Credit less
CAD 1,040,168 of funds drawn and outstanding on September 30, 2024) in principal. The outstanding principal and all accrued interest
became due and payable in full on May 1, 2024, the maturity date of the Line of Credit. The Lender has provided verbal assurances that
the Company may continue to borrow additional funds at the same terms as the Line of Credit. From October 1, 2024 to November 6, 2024,
the Company received cash advances of 3,836 (CAD 5,183) from the Lender. These is no guarantee that the Lender will continue to advance
cash to the Company. If required, we expect to be able to secure additional capital through advances from our Chief Executive Officer,
note holders, shareholders and others in order to pay expenses such as organizational costs, filing fees, accounting fees and legal fees,
however, we do not have any written or oral agreements with any other third parties which require them to fund our operations. The loans
from our Chief Executive Officer, note holders, shareholders and others are unsecured and non-interest bearing and have no set terms of
repayment. Our common stock started trading over the counter and has been quoted on the Over-The Counter Bulletin Board since February
17, 2011. The stock currently trades under the symbol TWOH.OB.

Our policy with regard to transactions with related
persons or entities is that such transactions must be on terms no less favorable than could be obtained from non-related persons. 

The above related party transactions are not necessarily
indicative of the amounts that would have been incurred had a comparable transaction been entered into with an independent party. The
terms of these transactions were more favorable than would have been attained if the transactions were negotiated at arm's length. 

PROPOSED TRANSACTIONS 

The Company is not anticipating any transactions. 

CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES INCLUDING INITIAL ADOPTION 

Refer to Note 2 in the consolidated financial statements
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 for information on accounting policies. 

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

The main risks of the Company s financial instrument
are exposed to are credit risk, market risk, foreign exchange risk, and liquidity risk. 

Credit risk 

The Company s credit risk is primarily attributable
to trade receivables. Trade receivables comprise amounts due from other businesses from the sale of groceries and dry goods. The Company
mitigates credit risk through approvals, limits and monitoring. The amounts disclosed in the consolidated balance sheet are net of allowances
for expected credit losses, estimated by the Company s management based on past experience and specific circumstances of the customer.
The Company manages credit risk for cash by placing deposits at major Canadian financial institutions. 

Market risk 

value of financial instruments. These risks are generally
outside the control of the Company. The objective of the Company is to mitigate market risk exposures within acceptable limits, while
maximizing returns. The Company s market risk consists of risks from changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and market
prices that affect its financial liabilities, financial assets and future transactions. 

Refer to Note 2 in the consolidated financial statements
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 for information on market risk. 

Foreign Exchange risk 

Our revenue is derived from operations in Canada.
Our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars and our liabilities other than trade payables are primarily due in
U.S. dollars. The revenue we earn in Canadian dollars is adversely impacted by the increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to
the Canadian dollar. 

Liquidity risk 

Liquidity risk relates to the risk the Company will
encounter difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with financial liabilities. The financial liabilities on our consolidated balance
sheets consist of accounts payable and accrued liabilities, due to related party, notes payable, convertible notes, net, derivative liabilities,
promissory notes, promissory notes related party and non-redeemable convertible notes, Management monitors cash flow requirements
and future cash flow forecasts to ensure it has access to funds through its existing cash and from operations to meet operational and
financial obligations. The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet its cash requirements for the next twelve months. 

OUTSTANDING SHARE DATA 

As of November 6, 2024, the following securities were

OFF-BALANCE SHEET TRANSACTIONS 

We currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK 

As a Smaller Reporting Company, as defined by Rule
12b-2 of the Exchange Act and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are electing scaled disclosure reporting obligations and therefore
are not required to provide the information requested by this Item. 

ITEM 4T. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

As required by Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated our company's disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this
evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this
report, these disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by our company
in reports it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities Exchange Commission and to ensure that such information is accumulated and
communicated to our company's management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. The conclusion that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective was due to the presence of
the following material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting which are indicative of many small companies with small
staff: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting
and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both United States generally accepted accounting principles
and Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines. Management anticipates that such disclosure controls and procedures will not be effective
until the material weaknesses are remediated. 

We plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design
of our internal controls over financial reporting. During the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, we have not been able
to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses, we plan to implement the following changes during
our fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, subject to obtaining additional financing: (i) appoint additional qualified personnel to address
inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management; and (ii) adopt sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting
and financial reporting. The remediation efforts set out above are largely dependent upon our securing additional financing to cover the
costs of implementing the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation efforts may be adversely affected
in a material manner. 

Because of the inherent limitations in all control
systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within our company have been detected.
These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because
of simple error or mistake. 

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting. 

29 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

We may be involved from time to time in ordinary litigation,
negotiation and settlement matters that will not have a material effect on our operations or finances. We are not aware of any pending
or threatened litigation against our Company or our officers and directors in their capacity as such that could have a material impact
on our operations or finances. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

A smaller reporting company is not required to provide
the information required by this Item. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
AND USE OF PROCEEDS. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024,
the Company elected to convert 67,006 of principal and interest of non-redeemable convertible notes into 670,061,200 shares of common

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the
Company elected to settle 17,500 of principal and interest of promissory notes by issuing 175,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company
with a fair value of 17,500. 

ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES. 

During the quarter ended September 30,
2024, we did not have any defaults upon senior securities. 

 ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES 

Not applicable. 

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION.
