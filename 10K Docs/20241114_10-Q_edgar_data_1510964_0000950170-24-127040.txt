million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and had an accumulated deficit of million as of September 30, 2024. Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operations, growth initiatives and to continue to make and implement strategic cost reductions, including reductions in employee headcount, vendor spending, and delaying expenses related to its drug development activities. The Company intends to position itself so that it will be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets, issuance of debt, and/or securing lines of credit. In July 2024, the Company received net proceeds of million under a Secured Promissory Note with Streeterville Capital, LLC, a Utah limited liability company ("Streeterville") - refer to Note 6 for more information. The Company's financial operating results and accumulated deficit, amongst other factors, raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company will continue to pursue the actions outlined above, as well as work towards increasing revenue and operating cash flows to meet its future liquidity requirements. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in any capital-raising efforts that it may undertake, and the failure of the Company to raise additional capital could adversely affect its future operations and viability.

Weighted Average Fair Value Per Share on Grant Date 

The Company did t grant stock options during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The risk-free interest rates are based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury constant maturities with remaining terms equivalent to the respective expected terms of the options. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's common stock. The Company estimates the expected term for stock options awarded to employees, officers and directors using the simplified method in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation, because the Company does not have sufficient relevant historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns. In the future, as the Company gains historical data for the actual term over which stock options are held, the expected term may change, which could substantially change the grant-date fair value of future stock option awards, and, consequently, compensation of future grants.

. On or about May 1, 2024, the Company and plaintiff executed a stipulation for the payment of the plaintiff's attorney's fees and expenses over the course of approximately eighteen months subject to a confession of judgment. On December 3, 2019, Michelene Colette and Leticia Shaw filed a putative class action complaint in the Central District of California, alleging the labeling on the Company s products violated the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 (the Colette Complaint ). On February 6, 2020, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the Colette Complaint. Instead of opposing the Company's motion, plaintiffs elected to file an amended complaint on February 25, 2020. On March 10, 2020, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The court issued a ruling on May 22, 2020 that stayed this proceeding in its entirety and dismissed part of the amended complaint. The court's order stated that the portion of the proceeding that is stayed will remain stayed until the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") completes its rulemaking regarding the marketing, including labelling, of CBD ingestible products. However, on January 26, 2023, the FDA announced that it does not intend to pursue rulemaking allowing the use of cannabidiol products in dietary supplements or conventional foods. As a result, on February 13, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a status report with the court asking to have the stay lifted. The Company filed a written opposition. The court has taken no action since Plaintiffs filed that status report, and the case remains stayed pursuant to the court's original order. On November 5, 2021, Mona Jr. filed a complaint against the Company for breach of contract and negligence in Nevada state court seeking to recover from the Company the amount of federal and state taxes, interest and penalties owed by Mona Jr. for taxes on income received by him upon the vesting and settlement of RSU's in 2019 - refer also to Note 12. Related Parties, for further information. On December 22, 2021, after removing the case to United States District Court for the District of Nevada, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that Mona Jr. should have pursued these claims in a prior arbitration between the parties. On September 12, 2022, the court denied the motion to dismiss the case. On November 3, 2022, the court on its own motion ordered the case into arbitration. On December 6, 2022, Mona Jr. filed a demand for arbitration against the Company and its officers with the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA"). On January 31, 2023, the Company and management filed a case in the San Diego Superior Court for declaratory relief, seeking to enjoin the arbitration on the grounds that Mona Jr. is barred from proceeding with the arbitration under the doctrines of res judicata and judicial estoppel based on the results of the prior arbitration between the parties and the position that Mona Jr. took against the Company in the prior arbitration. On February 2, 2023, the AAA stayed the arbitration for 60 days. On February 14, 2023, the Company filed a motion for preliminary injunction to enjoin Mona Jr. from proceeding with the arbitration. The preliminary injunction motion was scheduled for hearing on October 20, 2023. On March 20, 2023, the Company sought a temporary restraining order to enjoin Mona Jr. from proceeding with the arbitration, which the court denied. After the denial of the temporary restraining order, the Company withdrew its motion for preliminary injunction. On April 5, 2023, the AAA informed the parties that the stay issued on February 2, 2023 had been lifted. On April 28, 2023, the AAA appointed an arbitrator for the matter. On

 . In exchange, Mona Jr. agreed that notwithstanding the terms of his Employment Agreement providing for acceleration of vesting of all stock options upon a Good Reason resignation, certain of his unvested stock options would not immediately vest, but rather continue to vest if, and only if, certain Company milestones are achieved related to the Company s drug development efforts. These stock options were issued in July 2016 options) and March 2017 options), and of these stock options have not vested as of September 30, 2024. The Company and Mona Jr. also agreed to mutually release all claims arising out of and related to Mona Jr. s resignation and separation from the Company. As a result of Mona Jr.'s Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense related to (i) the accelerated vesting of the RSU's of million and (ii) due to the Settlement Agreement's modification of certain stock options of million during the year ended December 31, 2019 . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company cancelled fully vested outstanding stock options of Mona Jr. with a weighted average exercise price of per share, as these stock options remained unexercised and the deadline to exercise these stock options lapsed. In addition, shares of stock were issued to Mona Jr. upon the vesting and settlement of the RSU's. The settlement of the RSU's by the payment of shares was treated as taxable compensation to Mona Jr. and thus subject to income tax withholdings. No amounts were withheld (either in cash or the equivalent of shares of common stock from the settlement of the RSU's) or included in the original Company s payroll tax filing. The compensation was subject to Federal and State income tax withholding and Federal Insurance Contributions Act FICA taxes withholding estimated to be million for the employee portions. The employer portion of the FICA taxes was million and was recorded as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses in the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company reported the taxable compensation associated with the RSU settlement to the taxing authorities and included the amount in Mona Jr.'s W-2 for 2019. Although the primary tax liability is the responsibility of the employee, the Company is secondarily liable to the taxing authorities and thus has continued to reflect this liability on its balance sheet through December 31, 2022 in an amount of million, which was recorded as a component of accrued expenses. The Company initially recorded an offsetting receivable of million during the second quarter of 2019 for the total estimated Federal and State income taxes which should have been withheld in addition to the employee portion of the FICA payroll taxes as the primary liability is ultimately the responsibility of the employee. The receivable was recorded as a component of prepaid expense and other on the condensed balance sheet. The deadline to file and pay personal income taxes for 2019 with extensions was on October 15, 2020. To date, notwithstanding repeated requests from the Company, Mona Jr. has not provided to the Company the appropriate documentation substantiating that he properly filed and paid his taxes for 2019, and Mona Jr. has recently confirmed that he has not paid his personal income tax for 2019. As a result, the Company derecognized its previously recorded receivable of million during the fourth quarter of 2020. The associated liability would have been relieved once the tax amount was paid by Mona Jr.

As a result, the Company derecognized the contingent liability of million during the nine months ended June 30, 2023.

We had net product sales of 3.9 million and gross profit of 1.8 million, representing a gross margin of 46.0 , in the third quarter of 2024, compared to net product sales of 4.1 million and gross profit of 1.8 million, representing a gross margin of 45.1 , in the third quarter of 2023. Our net product sales decreased in the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the third quarter 2023 mostly due to lower B2B sales. The total number of units sold during the third quarter 2024 decreased by 7.9 compared to the third quarter 2023 and our average sales price per unit decreased slightly by 0.5 . In addition, 52.6 of our net revenue for the third quarter 2024 was from new products launched since January 1, 2022. During this time, we launched 39 new products. The overall market continues to be fragmented and highly competitive, which we believe is largely due to the lack of a clear regulatory framework and a patchwork of state regulation. 
 Cost of goods sold consists primarily of raw materials, packaging, manufacturing overhead (including payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, facilities, depreciation, supplies and quality assurance costs), merchant card fees and shipping. We were able to reduce our cost of goods sold in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 by 0.2 million, or 7 . The reduction is mostly due to the lower number of units sold in the third quarter of 2024. In addition, cost of goods sold in the third quarter of 2024 decreased as a percentage of revenue compared to the third quarter of 2023, mostly due to lower freight, cost savings and product mix in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior year period. Our gross profit remained flat at 1.8 million in the third quarter of 2024 and gross margin improved from 45.1 in the third quarter 2023 to 46.0 in the third quarter of 2024. The improvement in our gross margin is primarily due to our product and channel mix, lower freight, and cost savings.

Our net product sales decreased by 0.4 million, or 3 , in the first nine months of 2024 when compared to first nine months of 2023 results. The decline is primarily due to lower B2B sales in 2024, partially offset by higher B2C sales. The total number of units sold during the first nine months of 2024 decreased by 11.8 compared to the first nine months of 2023, partially offset by higher average sales price per unit of 7.7 . The average sales price per unit increased due to product and channel mix. Our B2C revenue increased by 0.1 million compared to the first nine months of 2023, mostly due to additional revenue from our subscriptions customers. In addition, 48.5 of our net revenue for the first nine months 2024 was from new products launched since January 1, 2022. During this time, we launched 39 new products. The overall market continues to be fragmented and highly competitive, which we believe is largely due to the lack of a clear regulatory framework and a patchwork of state regulation.

Third Quarter 2024 vs. 2023 
 Selling, general and administrative SG A expense decreased to 2.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2.2 million in the third quarter of 2023, which was primarily a result of the following: 
 Sales expense increased mostly due to higher payroll expense. 

Marketing expense decreased due to lower digital advertising spend, outside services, and payroll. Our reduced digital marketing expense declined due to lower advertising activity during the third quarter of 2024. 

General and administrative ("G A") expense for the third quarter of 2024 increased from the prior year period due to additional legal fee and higher general administrative expenses. Our third quarter 2024 included professional fees of 0.1 million associated with the legal dispute with the Company's founder. For more information on the Company's legal proceedings, please see Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies , to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, G A expense in the third quarter 2024 were impacted by favorable fair value adjustments to the earn-out for our Cultured Foods and Elevated Softgels acquisitions of 0.2 million. 

First Nine Months 2024 vs. 2023 
 21 

SG A expense decreased from 7.2 million for the first nine months of 2023 to 6.9 million for the first nine months of 2024, and included the following: 
 Sales expense slightly increased due to increases in payroll, partially offset by lower stock-based compensation. 

Marketing expense decreased due to lower digital advertising spend, outside services, and payroll. Our digital marketing expense declined due to lower advertising activity during the first nine months of 2024 and a favorable settlement of disputed invoices with an advertising agency of 0.1 million. 

G A expense increased by 0.4 million. The increase is mostly due to additional legal fees during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The current year period included professional fees of 0.8 million associated with the legal dispute with the Company's founder. The prior year period included legal fees of 0.3 million associated with the settlement of the Lamont legal case. For more information on the Company's legal proceedings, please see Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies , to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, G A expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were impacted by favorable fair value adjustments to the earn-out for our Cultured Foods and Elevated Softgels acquisitions of 0.2 million. 

Benefit from reversal of accrued payroll taxes 
 We previously recorded a contingent liability for payroll taxes associated with the RSU release to our founder in 2019 of 6.7 million. On April 15, 2023, the statute of limitations for federal payroll tax withholding expired. In addition, the statute of limitations for the state tax withholding expired during the six months ended June 30, 2023. As a result of the expiration of the relevant statutes of limitations, neither the IRS nor the State of California have the rights to assess and collect the 6.2 million of income taxes from the Company and we have made a change in accounting estimate and no longer expect to incur a loss with respect to this matter. As a result, we derecognized the contingent liability of 6.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For more information, please see Note 12, Related Parties , to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Other expense, net 
 Other expense, net consists of interest expense and interest income. Other expense increased by approximately 0.1 million in the three month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three month period ended September 30, 2023 due to the interest expense associated with the new Streeterville note payable. Other expense, net decreased by approximately 0.1 million in the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine month period ended September 30, 2023. Other expense, net included fair value increases for our financial instruments of 0.2 million in the first nine months of 2023 and interest expense for the new Streeterville note payable of 0.1 million in the first nine months of 2024. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We use Adjusted EBITDA internally to evaluate our performance and make financial and operational decisions that are presented in a manner that adjusts from their equivalent GAAP measures or that supplement the information provided by our GAAP measures. Adjusted EBITDA is defined by us as EBITDA (net income (loss) plus depreciation, interest and income tax expense, minus interest income), further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash expenses and other adjustments as set forth below. We use Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it also highlights trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures, since Adjusted EBITDA eliminates from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance. 
 We use Adjusted EBITDA in communicating certain aspects of our results and performance, including in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and believe that Adjusted EBITDA, when viewed in conjunction with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, can provide investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than GAAP measures alone. In addition, we believe the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in making period-to-period comparison of results because the adjustments to GAAP are not reflective of our core business performance. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is not presented in accordance with, or as an alternative to, GAAP financial measures and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We encourage investors to review the GAAP financial measures included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our condensed financial statements, to aid in their analysis and understanding of our performance and in making comparisons.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, our primary sources of capital came from (i) cash generated from our operations, (ii) existing cash, (iii) proceeds from note payable financings, and (iv) funds received from the IRS related to employee retention credits during the year ended December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 1.0 million of cash and working capital of approximately 0.6 million. 
 Excluding the funds for employee retention credits, we generated negative cash flows from operations of 0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company generated negative cash flows from operations of 0.7 million, and we had an accumulated deficit of 86.3 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 We believe that a combination of factors have adversely impacted our business operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023. Due to a low barrier entry market with a lack of a clear regulatory framework, we face intense competition from both licensed and illicit market operators that may also sell herbal supplements and hemp-based CBD consumer products. Because we operate in a market that is rapidly evolving and expanding globally, our customers may choose to obtain CBD products from our competitors, and our success depends on our ability to attract and retain our customers from purchasing CBD products elsewhere. To remain competitive, we intend to continue to innovate new products, build brand awareness, and make significant investments in our business strategy by introducing new products into the markets in which we operate, adopt quality assurance protocols and procedures, build our market presence, and undertake further research and development. In addition, we intend to make additional acquisitions to further diversify our product offerings. 
 Management implemented, and continues to make and implement, strategic cost reductions, including reductions in employee headcount, vendor spending, and the delaying of certain expenses related to our drug development activities. To the extent that we feel it is necessary and in the best interest of the Company and our shareholders, we may also take further actions that alter our operations in order to ensure the success of our business. 
 Cultured Foods Acquisition 
 On December 7, 2023, the Company entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the Cultured Foods Purchase Agreement ), by and among the Company, Cultured Foods, Brian Carl McWhorter (the Cultured Foods Member and Barbara McWhorter, pursuant to which the Company purchased all of the outstanding equity interests in Cultured Foods, resulting in Cultured Foods becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the Cultured Foods Acquisition ). Cultured Foods is a leading European manufacturer and distributor of plant-based protein products. The Cultured Foods Acquisition closed on December 7, 2023. 
 23 

In consideration for the Cultured Foods Acquisition, at closing, the Company (i) made a cash payment of 175,000 to the Cultured Foods Member, less a 17,500 holdback (the Holdback Amount and certain other adjustments provided for in the Cultured Foods Purchase Agreement (the Cultured Foods Closing Payment ), and (ii) issued an aggregate of 7,074,270 restricted shares of Company common stock to the Cultured Foods Member, valued at 250,000 based on the three day volume weighted average price of the Company s common stock on the three trading days prior to closing (the Cultured Foods Closing Shares, and together with the Cultured Foods Closing Payment, the Cultured Foods Closing Consideration ). The Cultured Foods Closing Payment is subject to adjustment, upward or downward, based on post-closing adjustments to the net working capital of Cultured Foods within 120 days of closing, as reflected in the Final Working Capital Statement (as defined in the Cultured Foods Purchase Agreement). Additionally, within 90 days following the final determination of the Final Working Capital Statement (the Cultured Foods Receivables Date ), the Company shall be entitled to recover from the Cultured Foods Member an amount equal to the unpaid balance, as of the Cultured Foods Receivables Date, of all accounts receivable which were included in as assets in the Final Working Capital Statement. 
 The Company shall release the Holdback Amount, less any amounts owed to the Company by the Cultured Foods Member pursuant to the Cultured Foods Purchase Agreement, including without limitation as a result of the post-closing adjustments discussed above, to the Cultured Foods Member one year from the Closing Date. 
 In addition to the Cultured Foods Closing Consideration, and as further consideration for the Cultured Foods Acquisition, the Company shall make an additional cash payment to the Cultured Foods Member in the form of an earn-out (the Cultured Foods Earnout Amount ), which shall be based on Company revenues generated in fiscal 2024 and will be calculated as follows: 
 If Cultured Foods net revenue is at least 500,000, then the Cultured Foods Earnout Amount will be 110,000. 

If Cultured Foods net revenue is at least 450,000 but less than 500,000, then the Cultured Foods Earnout Amount will be 75,000. 

If Cultured Foods net revenue is at least 400,000 but less than 450,000, then the Cultured Foods Earnout Amount will be 50,000. 

If Cultured Foods net revenue is at least 300,000 but less than 400,000, then the Cultured Foods Earnout Amount will be 20,000. 

If Cultured Foods net revenue (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) is less than 300,000, then the Cultured Foods Earnout Amount will be 0. 

The Cultured Foods Earnout Payment shall be paid within 10 business days after the final determination of Cultured Foods net revenue for fiscal 2024, as determined in accordance with the Cultured Foods Purchase Agreement. Net revenues of Cultured Foods are expected to be insufficient to trigger any earn-out payments. 
 Pursuant to the Cultured Foods Purchase Agreement, the Cultured Foods Member agreed that he will not, on any single trading day sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any Company common stock, including the Cultured Foods Closing Shares, in an aggregate amount exceeding the greater of (i) 15 of the of the Company s common stock sold in the aggregate based on the greater of the current or proceeding trading day, and (ii) 3,000 in gross value; provided, however, that in the event that the Company enters into a leak-out agreement with any third party on terms more favorable than the foregoing, the Cultured Foods Member shall be afforded the same more favorable terms offered to such third party. 
 Additionally, for a period of one year following the closing date, the Cultured Foods Member and Ms. McWhorter, including their affiliates, shall be prohibited from engaging in certain competitive and/or solicitation activities within the United States and the European Union, as more particularly set forth in the Cultured Foods Purchase Agreement. 
 Elevated Softgels Acquisition 
 On May 8, 2024, the Company entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the Softgels Purchase Agreement ), by and among the Company, Elevated Softgels, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Elevated Softgels ), Clayton J. Montgomery (a Softgels Member ), Chris Fagan, Andrew Kester, and Timothy McGreer, pursuant to which the Company purchased all of the outstanding equity interests in Elevated Softgels, resulting in Elevated Softgels becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the Softgels Acquisition ). Elevated Softgels is a leading manufacturer of softgels. The Softgels Acquisition closed on May 13, 2024. 
 In consideration for the Softgels Acquisition, at closing, the Company (i) made a cash payment of 100,000 to the Softgels Member, less certain transaction expenses and certain other adjustments provided for in the Softgels Purchase Agreement (the Softgels Closing Payment ), (ii) issued an aggregate of 15,854,185 restricted shares of Company common stock to the Member valued at 637,000, and (iii) issued an aggregate of 1,567,996 restricted shares of Company common stock to the selling broker of Elevated Softgels valued at 63,000. The Company common stock was valued based on the thirty-day volume weighted average price of the Company s common stock on the thirty trading days prior to the date of the Softgels Purchase Agreement (the Softgels Closing Shares, and together with the Softgels Closing Payment, the Softgels Closing Consideration ). The Softgels Closing Payment is subject to adjustment, upward or downward, based on post-closing adjustments to the net working capital of Elevated Softgels within 120 days of closing, as reflected 
 24 

in the Final Working Capital Statement (as defined in the Softgels Purchase Agreement). Additionally, within 90 days following the final determination of the Final Working Capital Statement (the Softgels Receivables Date ), the Company shall be entitled to recover from the Softgels Member an amount equal to the unpaid balance, as of the Softgels Receivables Date, of all accounts receivable which were included in as assets in the Final Working Capital Statement. 
 In addition to the Softgels Closing Consideration, and as further consideration for the Softgels Acquisition, the Company shall make an additional payment in the form of an earn-out (the Softgels Earnout Amount ), which shall be based on Company Net Revenue (as defined in the Softgels Purchase Agreement) generated during the 12-month period following the closing date and will be calculated as follows: 
 If the Company s Net Revenue is at least 700,000, then the Softgels Earnout Amount will be 200,000. 

If the Company s Net Revenue is at least 650,000 but less than 700,000, then the Softgels Earnout Amount will be 125,000. 

If the Company s Net Revenue is at least 600,000 but less than 650,000, then the Softgels Earnout Amount will be 50,000. 

If the Company s Net Revenue is at least 550,000 but less than 600,000, then the Softgels Earnout Amount will be 25,000. 

If the Company s Net Revenue (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) is less than 550,000, then the Softgels Earnout Amount will be 0. 

The Softgels Earnout Payment shall be paid within 10 business days after the final determination of the Company s Net Revenue for the 12-month period following the closing date, as determined in accordance with the Softgels Purchase Agreement. 50 of the Softgels Earnout payment shall be paid in cash and 50 of the Softgels Earnout payment shall be in the form of restricted common stock of the Company, with the number of shares determined based upon the thirty-day volume weighted average price of the Company's common stock as of the 12-month anniversary of the closing date. Net revenues of Elevated Softgels are expected to be insufficient to trigger any earn-out payments. 
 Pursuant to the Softgels Purchase Agreement, the recipients of the Company's common stock agreed that they will not, on any single trading day sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any Company common stock, including the Softgels Closing Shares, in an aggregate amount exceeding the greater of (i) 15 of the of the Company s common stock sold in the aggregate based on the greater of the current or proceeding trading day, and (ii) 3,000 in gross value; provided, however, that in the event that the Company enters into a leak-out agreement with any third party on terms more favorable than the foregoing, the Softgels Member shall be afforded the same more favorable terms offered to such third party. 
 Additionally, for a period of one year following the closing date, Mr. Montgomery and Mr. Fagan shall be prohibited from engaging in certain competitive and/or solicitation activities within the United States, as more particularly set forth in the Softgels Purchase Agreement. 
 July 2024 Streeterville Note 
 On July 3, 2024, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the Note Purchase Agreement with Streeterville Capital, LLC, a Utah limited liability company Streeterville ), pursuant to which we issued and sold to Streeterville a Secured Promissory Note in the original principal amount of 1,188,500 (the Note ). The Note carries an original issuance discount of 283,500 and we agreed to pay 5,000 to Streeterville to cover legal fees, each of which were deducted from the proceeds of the Note received by us, which resulted in a purchase price received by us of 900,000 (the Purchase Price ). 
 The unpaid amount of the Note, any interest, fees, charges and late fees accrued shall be due and payable in twelve months from July 3, 2024 (the Maturity Date ). We are required to make weekly repayments to Streeterville of 22,855.77. We can pay all or any portion of the outstanding balance earlier than it is due without penalty. In the event we repay the Note in full on or before December 31, 2024, we will receive a 75,000 discount from the outstanding balance. The Note is secured by all of our assets pursuant to a Security Agreement entered into with Streeterville on July 3, 2024. No interest will accrue on the Note unless and until an occurrence of an Event of Default (as discussed below). 
 The Note provides for customary events of default (each as defined in the Note, an Event of Default ), including, among other things, the event of nonpayment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts, a representation or warranty proving to have been incorrect when made, failure to perform or observe covenants within a specified cure period, a cross-default to certain other indebtedness and material agreements of the Company, and the occurrence of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event affecting the Company. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default that is deemed a Major Trigger Event as defined in the Note, Streeterville may increase the outstanding balance of the Note by 20 , and upon the occurrence of an Event of Default that is deemed a Minor Trigger Event as defined in the Note, Streeterville may increase the outstanding balance of the Note by 5 . Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Streeterville may declare all amounts owed under the Note immediately due and payable. In addition, upon the occurrence of an Event 
 25 

of Default, upon the election of Streeterville, interest shall begin accruing on the outstanding balance of the Note from the date of the Event of Default equal to the lesser of 22 per annum and the maximum rate allowable under law. 
 First Insurance Funding Agreements 
 In October 2024, we entered into a new finance agreement with First Insurance Funding in order to fund a portion of our insurance policies for the upcoming policy year. The amount financed is 0.2 million, which incurs interest at an annual rate of 8.42 . We are required to make monthly payments of 20,396 from November 2024 through July 2025. 
 In November 2023, we entered into a finance agreement with First Insurance Funding in order to fund a portion of our insurance policies. The amount financed was 0.3 million, which incurred interest at an annual rate of 8.42 . We were required to make monthly payments of 29,781 from November 2023 through July 2024. There was no outstanding balance as of September 30, 2024. 
 Accrued Payroll Taxes 
 The Company previously recorded accrued payroll taxes associated with the RSU release to Mona Jr. in 2019. On April 15, 2023, the statute of limitations for federal payroll tax withholding expired. In addition, the statute of limitations for the state tax withholding expired during the year ended December 31, 2023. As a result of the expiration of the relevant statutes of limitations, the Company believes that neither the IRS nor the State of California have the rights to assess and collect the 6.2 million of income taxes from CV Sciences and we have made a change in accounting estimate and no longer expect to incur a loss with respect to this matter. As a result, we derecognized the accrued payroll taxes of 6.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. For more information, please see Note 12, Related Parties , to our consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 On November 5, 2021, Mona Jr. filed a complaint against the Company for breach of contract and negligence in Nevada state court seeking to recover from the Company the amount of federal and state taxes, interest and penalties owed by Mona Jr. for taxes on income received by him upon the vesting and settlement of RSU's in 2019. The hearing on the merits began on April 8, 2024, and the Arbitrator heard five days of testimony. The hearing resumed on May 21, 2024 and concluded on May 23, 2024. Post-hearing briefing has been submitted to the Arbitrator. A decision from the Arbitrator is expected to follow. Management believes that Mona Jr.'s claims lack merit. Nevertheless, an unfavorable outcome would have a material impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. For more information, please see Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies , to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Going Concern 
 U.S. GAAP requires management to assess a company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the financial statement issuance date and to provide related note disclosure in certain circumstances. Our consolidated financial statements and corresponding notes have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. Excluding the funds for employee retention credits, we generated negative cash flows from operations of 0.5 million and 0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and had an accumulated deficit of 86.3 million as of September 30, 2024. Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund our operations and growth initiatives. The Company intends to position itself so that it will be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets, issuance of debt, and/or securing lines of credit in order to continue its operations. However, there can be no assurances that additional working capital will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all, which would be likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to continue its operations. 
 The Company's financial operating results and accumulated deficit, amongst other factors, raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company will continue to work towards increasing revenue and operating cash flows to meet its future liquidity requirements. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in any capital-raising efforts that it may undertake, and the failure of the Company to raise additional capital could adversely affect its future operations and viability.

Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities includes net income (loss) adjusted for non-cash items such as depreciation, amortization, bad debt expense, stock-based compensation, benefit of reversal of payroll tax liability and interest expense related to our promissory notes. Operating assets and liabilities primarily include balances related to funding of inventory purchases and customer accounts receivable. Operating assets and liabilities that arise from the funding of inventory purchases and customer accounts receivable can fluctuate significantly from day to day and period to period depending on the timing of inventory purchases and customer payment behavior. 
 Cash used in operating activities was 0.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash provided by operating activities of 2.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The period over period decrease in our cash flow from operating activities by 3.1 million was mostly due to the receipt of the ERC funds in the prior year period and the fact that we did not receive similar funds in the 2024 period. Our net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, adjusted for non-cash items, resulted in a net loss of 1.0 million, compared to a net loss, adjusted for non-cash items, of 1.3 million in the prior year period, an improvement of 0.3 million. Changes in working capital generated 0.3 million during the first nine months of 2024, compared to cash generated of 3.6 million during the same period of 2023, a decrease of 3.3 million. Our changes in working capital decreased primarily due to the fact that we received the ERC funds of 2.5 million from the IRS during the first nine months of 2023 and we did not receive similar funds in the 2024 period. Our net income (loss) declined by 5.8 million from a net income of 4.0 million in the first nine months of 2023 to a net loss of 1.9 million in the first nine months of 2024, mostly due to the benefit for the reversal of accrued payroll taxes. Non-cash adjustments decreased by 6.1 million, as we recognized a benefit for the reversal of accrued payroll tax of 6.2 million related to the RSU's previously issued to Mona Jr. during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Recurring non-cash adjustments consists of depreciation, amortization, interest expense and stock-based compensation. 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash used in investing activities was 6,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to our acquisition of Elevated Softgels in May 2024. We did not use any cash in investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared net cash used in financing activities of 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of proceeds from our note payable financing with Streeterville of 0.9 million, offset by repayments of our insurance financing, the Streeterville note payable and the notes payable that we assumed in connection with the Cultured Foods acquisition. Our financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of repayments of the Streeterville note payable of 1.1 million and our insurance financing of 0.2 million. 
 Inflation 
 We have not been affected materially by inflation during the periods presented. However, recent trends towards rising inflation may adversely impact our business and corresponding financial position and cash flow. 
 Known Trends or Uncertainties 
 There can be no assurance that the Company s business and corresponding financial performance will not be adversely affected by general economic or consumer trends. In particular, global economic conditions remain constrained, and if such conditions continue, recur or worsen, this may have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, inflation has risen and Federal Reserve interest rates remain high after increases during 2023, which may also materially adversely our business and corresponding financial position and cash flows. 
 Furthermore, such economic conditions have produced downward pressure on share prices and on the availability of credit for financial institutions and corporations. If current levels of market disruption and volatility continue, the Company might experience reductions in business activity, increased funding costs and funding pressures, as applicable, a decrease in the market price of shares of our common stock, a decrease in asset values, additional write-downs and impairment charges and lower profitability. Additionally, it is possible that U.S. policy changes and uncertainty about such changes, including changes and uncertainty as a result of the U.S. presidential election, could increase market volatility. 
 28 

We have seen some consolidation in our industry during economic downturns. These consolidations have not had a negative effect on our total sales; however, should consolidations and downsizing in the industry continue to occur, those events could adversely impact our revenues and earnings going forward. 
 There is currently a lack of a clear federal regulatory framework regarding the development, sale and use of CBD products in the United States. As a result, differing state regulations have emerged, which regulations are constantly evolving and differ significantly from state to state in many cases. Several states, including without limitation, California, Florida, Maryland, Minnesota, New York, Utah and Virginia, have recently adopted regulations that may impact our ability to sell certain of our products in these states. In September 2024, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed an emergency order into law, effectively banning the sale of hemp products intended for human use that contain detectable amounts of THC or certain other cannabinoids in California, amongst other things. The emergency order will remain in effect until March 25, 2025, unless extended in accordance with applicable law. We have certain products which fall under this category that we have historically sold in California. It is currently unknown whether the duration of the emergency order will be extended, and/or whether it will be replaced with a permanent law with similar or more stringent prohibitions. This emergency order had a negative impact on our operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and we expect that it will continue to have a negative impact on our business going forward for so long as it, or any permanent law with similar or more stringent prohibitions, remains in effect; however, it is currently impossible to quantify the expected impact on our business. There is also substantial uncertainty and different interpretations among federal, state and local regulatory agencies, legislators, academics and businesses as to the emerging regulation of cannabinoids. These different opinions include, but are not limited to, the regulation of cannabinoids by the FDA and the extent to which manufacturers of products containing cannabinoids may engage in interstate commerce. These uncertainties have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our business. Additionally, restrictive state regulations could adversely impact our revenue and earnings going forward. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 We have disclosed in Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our 2023 Annual Report, filed with the SEC March 29, 2024, those accounting policies and estimates that we consider to be significant in determining our results of operation and financial condition. There have been no material changes to those policies and estimates that we consider to be significant since the filing of our 2023 Annual Report. The accounting principles used in preparing our unaudited condensed financial statements conform in all material respects to GAAP.

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")), are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.
