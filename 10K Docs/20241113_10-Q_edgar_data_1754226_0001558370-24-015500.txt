 locations in Orange County, New York, in Westchester County, New York, in Rockland County, New York, and in Bronx County, New York. Its primary deposit products are checking, savings, and term certificate accounts, and its primary lending products are commercial real estate, commercial and residential mortgage loans. Substantially all loans are secured by specific items of collateral including business assets, consumer assets, and commercial and residential real estate. Commercial loans are expected to be repaid from cash flow from operations of businesses. There are no significant concentrations of loans to any one industry or customer. However, the customers ability to repay their loans is dependent on the real estate and general economic conditions in the areas in which they operate. Assets held by the Company in an agency or fiduciary capacity for its customers are excluded from the consolidated financial statements since they do not constitute assets of the Company. Assets held by the Company in an agency or fiduciary capacity for its customers amounted to billion and billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the audited consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes for the year ended December 31, 2023 for Orange County Bancorp contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 29, 2024. In the opinion of the management of the Company, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting solely of normal and recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly the financial position as of September 30, 2024, the results of operations, comprehensive income, and changes in stockholders equity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and cash flow statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year or for any future period.

As of December 31, 2023, the Company s securities portfolio consisted of securities, of which were in an unrealized loss position. Unrealized losses are primarily related to the Company s mortgage backed securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investments in obligations of states and political subdivisions as discussed below. Available for sale securities are evaluated to determine if a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis has resulted from a credit loss or other factors. An impairment related to credit factors would be recorded through an allowance for credit losses. The allowance is limited to the amount by which the security s amortized cost basis exceeds the fair value. An impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses shall be recorded through other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. Investment securities will be written down to fair value through the Consolidated Statements of Income when management intends to sell, or may be required to sell, the securities before they recover in value. Primarily all of the investment securities are backed by loans guaranteed by either U.S. government agencies or U.S government-sponsored entities, and management believes that default is highly unlikely given the lack of historical credit losses and governmental backing. Management believes that the unrealized losses on these securities are a function of changes in market interest rates and credit spreads, not changes in credit quality. The Company s available for sale debt securities portfolio includes U.S. government agencies and treasuries, mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds, and obligations of states and political subdivisions, as well as other securities. These types of securities may include a risk of future impairment charges as a result of the changes in market interest rates, unpredictable nature of the U.S. economy and their potential negative effect on the future performance of the security issuers. Available for sale debt securities in unrealized loss positions are evaluated for impairment related to credit losses on a quarterly basis. Management reviewed the collectability of these securities, taking into consideration such factors as financial condition of the issuers, credit ratings when available, reported capital ratios of the issuers, among other pertinent factors. Management also evaluated the credit quality, the ability and intent to hold these securities to maturity, and the impact of interest rates on the respective fair values of the securities.

The Company does not intend to sell any of its available for sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position prior to recovery of their amortized cost basis, and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell any of its securities prior to recovery of their amortized cost basis. The following table presents the activity in the allowance for credit losses associated with investment securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024: Charge-offs Recoveries Ending balance The recovery reflected in the table above represents the sale of the Signature Bank subordinated debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Individually Analyzed Loans Effective January 1, 2023, the Company began analyzing loans on an individual basis when management determined that the loan no longer exhibited risk characteristics consistent with the risk characteristics existing in its designated pool of loans, under the Company's CECL methodology. Loans individually analyzed include certain nonaccrual commercial, as well as certain accruing loans previously identified under prior troubled debt restructuring (TDR) guidance. As of September 30, 2024, the Company held million in non-accrual balances and a related ACL of approximately million. Within the non-accrual balances, thousand of these loans had no ACL associated to them. As of December 31, 2023, the

As of December 31, 2023, the amortized cost basis of individually analyzed loans was million and a related ACL of approximately thousand. For collateral dependent loans where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is likely to be substantially provided through the sale or operation of the collateral, the ACL is measured based on the difference between the fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost basis of the loan, at measurement date. Certain assets held as collateral may be exposed to future deterioration in fair value, particularly due to changes in real estate markets or usage.

The Company adopted ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326) Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures ASU 2022-02 effective January 1, 2023. The amendments in ASU 2022-02 eliminated the recognition and measurement of troubled debt restructurings and enhanced disclosures for loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The Company did not have any loans that were both experiencing financial difficulties and modified during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. In order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on any of its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification. This evaluation is performed within the scope of the Company s internal underwriting policy.

Credit Quality Indicators: The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis includes loans with an outstanding balance greater than thousand and non-homogeneous loans, such as commercial and commercial real estate loans. This analysis is performed on an annual basis. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings:

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements. Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, future events and our financial performance. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as may, might, should, could, predict, potential, believe, expect, attribute, continue, will, anticipate, seek, estimate, intend, plan, projection, goal, target, outlook, aim, would, annualized and outlook, or the negative version of those words or other comparable words or phrases of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: statements of our goals, intentions and expectations; statements regarding our business plans, prospects, growth and operating strategies; statements regarding the quality of our loan and investment portfolios; and estimates of our risks and future costs and benefits. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, management s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. Accordingly, we caution you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions, estimates and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: inflation and changes in the interest rate environment that reduce our margins or reduce the fair value of financial instruments; general economic conditions, either nationally or in our market areas, that are worse than expected; changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and write-offs and changes in estimates of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses; our ability to access cost-effective funding; events involving the failure of financial institutions may adversely affect our business, and the market price of our common stock; fluctuations in real estate values and both residential and commercial real estate market conditions; demand for loans and deposits in our market area; risks associated with loan participations; our ability to implement and change our business strategies; competition among depository and other financial institutions; the amounts of non-performing loans and loans that are charged-off; adverse changes in the securities markets;

The foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with other cautionary statements that are included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. If one or more events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from what we anticipate. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict those events or how they may affect us. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Overview We are a bank holding company headquartered in Middletown, New York and registered under the Bank Holding Company Act. Through our wholly owned subsidiaries, Orange Bank Trust Company and Hudson Valley Investment Advisors, Inc., we offer full-service commercial and consumer banking products and services and trust and wealth management services to small businesses, middle-market enterprises, local municipal governments and affluent individuals in the Lower Hudson Valley region, the New York metropolitan area and nearby markets in Connecticut and New Jersey. By combining the high-touch service and relationship-based focus of a community bank with the extensive suite of financial products and services offered by our larger competitors, we believe we can capitalize on the substantial growth opportunities available in our market areas. We also offer a variety of deposit accounts to businesses and consumers, including checking accounts and a full line of municipal banking accounts through our business banking platform. These activities, together with our 16 offices and one loan production office, continue to produce a stable source of low- cost core deposits and a diverse loan portfolio with attractive risk-adjusted yields. We also offer private banking services through Orange Bank Trust Private Banking, a division of Orange Bank Trust Company, and provide trust and wealth management services through Orange Bank Trust Company s trust services department and HVIA, which combined had 1.8 billion in assets under management at September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, our assets, loans, deposits and stockholders equity totaled 2.5

 billion, 1.8 billion, 2.1 billion and 193.1 million, respectively. Key Factors Affecting Our Business Net Interest Income. Net interest income is the most significant contributor to our net income and is the difference between the interest and fees earned on interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is primarily a function of the average balances and yields/rates of these interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. These factors are influenced by internal considerations such as product mix and risk appetite as well as external influences such as economic conditions, competition for loans and deposits and market interest rates. The cost of our deposits and short-term borrowings is primarily based on short-term interest rates, which are largely driven by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System s (the FRB actions and market competition. The yields generated by our loans and securities are typically affected by short-term and long-term interest rates, which are driven by market competition and market rates often impacted by the FRB s actions. The level of net interest income is influenced by movements in such interest rates and the pace at which such movements occur. Considering the impact of the FRB s rate reduction during third quarter 2024, we expect that interest rates may continue to drop during the next several quarters. Although our asset sensitivity is relatively neutral, this movement could have a beneficial impact on our net interest income. Noninterest Income . Noninterest income is also a contributor to our net income. Noninterest income consists primarily of our investment advisory income, trust income generated by HVIA and our trust department, as well as income generated by our BOLI investment earnings. In addition, noninterest income is also impacted by net gains (losses) on the sale of investment securities, service charges on deposit accounts, and other fee income consisting primarily of debit card fee income, checkbook fees and rebates and safe deposit box rental income. Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense includes salaries, employee benefits, occupancy, professional fees, directors fees and expenses, computer software expense, federal deposit insurance assessment, advertising expenses, advisor expenses related to trust income and other expenses. In evaluating our level of noninterest expense, we closely monitor our efficiency ratio. The efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing noninterest expense to net interest income plus noninterest income. We continue to seek to identify ways to streamline our business and operate more efficiently. Credit Quality. We have well established loan policies and underwriting practices that have resulted in relatively low levels of loan charge-offs and nonperforming assets in recent periods. We strive to originate quality loans that will maintain the credit quality of our loan portfolio. However, credit trends in the markets in which we operate are largely impacted by economic conditions beyond our control and can adversely impact our financial condition. Competition. The industry and businesses in which we operate are highly competitive. We may see increased competition in different areas including interest rates, underwriting standards and product offerings and structure. While we seek to maintain an appropriate return on our investments, we anticipate that we will experience continued pressure on our net interest margins as we operate in this competitive environment. Economic Conditions. Our business and financial performance are affected by economic conditions generally in the United States and more directly in the market of the Lower Hudson Valley region, the New York metropolitan area and nearby markets in Connecticut and New Jersey where we primarily operate. The significant economic factors that are most relevant to our business and our financial performance include, but are not limited to, real estate values, interest rates and unemployment rates. Regulatory Trends. We operate in a highly regulated environment and nearly all of our operations are subject to extensive regulation and supervision. Bank or securities regulators, Congress, the State of New York, the FRB and the New York State Department of Financial Services (the NYSDFS may revise the laws and regulations applicable to us, may impose new laws and regulations, increase the level of scrutiny of our business in the supervisory process, and pursue additional enforcement actions against financial institutions. Future legislative and regulatory changes such as these may increase our costs and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The legislative and regulatory trends that will affect us in the future are impossible to predict with any certainty.

 Critical Accounting Estimates Critical accounting estimates are necessary in the application of certain accounting policies and procedures and are particularly susceptible to significant change. Critical accounting policies are defined as those involving significant judgments and assumptions by management that could have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income under different assumptions or conditions. These critical estimates, policies and their application are periodically reviewed with the Audit Committee and the board of directors. Management believes that the most critical accounting estimates, which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments, are as follows: Allowance for Credit Losses. Management believes that the determination of the allowance for credit losses involves a high degree of complexity and requires management to make difficult and subjective judgments, which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters. Changes in these judgments, assumptions or estimates could materially impact the results of operations for Orange County Bancorp. A summary of our accounting policies, included the Allowance for Credit Losses, is included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K. There were no significant changes to the critical accounting estimates during the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 29, 2024. Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition Summary Financial Condition . The following table sets forth a summary of the material categories of our balance sheet at the dates indicated:

Our total assets were 2.5 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 33.6 million, or 1.4 , from December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by increases of 43.2 million in loans, net and 13.5 million in cash and due from banks, partially offset by a decrease of 20.4 million in investment securities, available for sale. Cash and due from banks. Cash and due from banks increased 13.5 million, or 9.2 , to 160.9 million at September 30, 2024, from 147.4 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was mainly the result of management s focus on using deposit growth during the period to maintain a strong liquidity position while paying down borrowings.

Commercial real estate loans increased by 75.2 million, or 6.0 , to 1.3 billion at September 30, 2024. Consumer loans increased 4.7 million, or 12.9 , to 41.3 million at September 30, 2024 from 36.6 million at December 31, 2023. Commercial and industrial loans experienced a decrease of 22.0 million, or 8.1 , to 251.3 million at September 30, 2024 from 273.3 million at December 31, 2023. Residential real estate loans decreased 3.9 million, or 4.9 , to 74.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 78.3 million at December 31, 2023. The overall diversification within the commercial real estate portfolio continues to provide stability while we remained focused on loan originations to new and existing customers during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as well as our continued commitment to geographic expansion in our market area. Non-performing Assets Management reviews a loan for individual evaluation when it is non-performing or when it is probable at least a portion of the loan will not be collected in accordance with the original terms due to a deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower or the value of the underlying collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. When a loan is determined to be non-performing, the measurement of the loan in the allowance for credit losses is based on the fair value of the collateral for all collateral-dependent loans. Non-accrual loans are loans for which collectability is questionable and, therefore, interest on such loans will no longer be recognized on an accrual basis. All loans that become 90 days or more delinquent are placed on non-accrual status unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. When loans are placed on non-accrual status, unpaid accrued interest is fully reversed, and further income is recognized only to the extent received on a cash basis or cost recovery method. When we acquire real estate as a result of foreclosure, the real estate is classified as real estate owned. The real estate owned is recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Soon after acquisition, we order a new appraisal to determine the current market value of the property. Any excess of the recorded value of the loan satisfied over the market value of the property is charged against the allowance for credit losses, or, if the existing allowance is inadequate, charged to expense of the current period. After acquisition, all costs incurred in maintaining the property are expensed. Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property, however, are capitalized to the extent of estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell. Management will consider a modification of loan terms, such as a reduction of the interest rate to below market terms, capitalizing past due interest or extending the maturity date and possibly a partial forgiveness of the principal amount due, when it is deemed appropriate based on individual borrower conditions. Interest income on restructured loans is accrued after the borrower demonstrates the ability to pay under the restructured terms through a sustained period of repayment performance, which is generally six consecutive months.

 The following table sets forth information regarding our non-performing assets. Non-performing loans aggregated approximately 11.2 million at September 30, 2024 as compared to 4.4 million at December 31, 2023. 

At September 30, At December 31, 2024 2023 (Dollars in thousands) Non-accrual loans: Commercial and industrial 199 556 Commercial real estate 10,725 2,692 Commercial real estate construction Residential real estate 8 1,179 Home equity Consumer Total non-accrual loans 10,932 4,427 Accruing loans 90 days or more past due: Commercial and industrial 237 Commercial real estate Commercial real estate construction Residential real estate Home equity Consumer Total accruing loans 90 days or more past due 237 Total non-performing loans 11,169 4,427 Other real estate owned Other non-performing assets Total non-performing assets 11,169 4,427 Ratios: Total non-performing loans to total loans 0.62 0.25 Total non-performing loans to total assets 0.44 0.18 Total non-performing assets to total assets 0.44 0.18 Non-performing loans at September 30, 2024 totaled 11.2 million and consisted of 10.7 million of commercial real estate loans, 436 thousand of commercial and industrial loans (accruing and non-accruing), and 8 thousand of residential real estate loans. The increase in non-performing loans was primarily the result of the addition of one non-accrual commercial real estate office space loan participation which was classified as non-accrual during second quarter 2024 as it was expected to become greater than 90 days delinquent. During the third quarter of 2024, this loan was written down by approximately 4.0 million from its principal balance of 14.7 million and is approximately 10.7 million as of September 30, 2024. We had no other real estate owned at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Non-performing assets increased 6.7 million, or 152.3 , to 11.2 million, or 0.44 of total assets, at September 30, 2024 from 4.4 million, or 0.18 of total assets, at December 31, 2023. The increase in non-performing assets at September 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023 was primarily driven by an increase of 8.0 million in non-accrual commercial real estate loans described above offset by net-reductions in the level of non-performing loans in the residential real estate loan category and the commercial and industrial loan segment. From time to time, as part of our loss mitigation strategy, we may renegotiate loan terms based on the economic and legal reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties. There were no loans modified due to financial difficulties during the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Classified Assets. Federal regulations provide that loans and other assets of lesser quality should be classified as substandard , doubtful or loss assets. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets 

 38 

Table of Contents 
 classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. We designate an asset as special mention if the asset has a potential weakness that warrants management s close attention. The following table summarizes classified assets of all portfolio types at the dates indicated: 

At September 30, At December 31, 2024 2023 (Dollars in thousands) Classification of Assets: Substandard 42,620 19,615 Doubtful Loss Total Classified Assets 42,620 19,615 Special Mention 26,270 32,804 On the basis of management s review of our assets, we have classified 42.6 million of our assets at September 30, 2024 as substandard compared to 19.6 million at December 31, 2023, due to a combination of certain trends and delinquencies within those loans. There were no doubtful assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We designated 26.3 million of our assets at September 30, 2024 as special mention compared to 32.8 million designated as special mention at December 31, 2023. Allowance for Credit Losses On January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13 (Topic 326), which replaced the incurred loss methodology with CECL for financial instruments measured at amortized cost and other commitments to extend credit. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation allowance for management s estimate of expected credit losses in the loan portfolio. The process to determine expected credit losses utilizes analytic tools and judgement and is reviewed on a quarterly basis. When management is reasonably certain that a loan balance is not fully collectable, an analysis is completed and a specific reserve may be established or a full or partial charge off could be recorded against the allowance. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Management estimates the allowance balance via a quantitative analysis which considers available information from internal and external sources related to past loan loss and prepayment experience and current conditions, as well as the incorporation of reasonable and supportable forecasts. Management evaluates a variety of factors including available published economic information in arriving at its forecast. Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. Also included in the allowance for credit losses are qualitative reserves that are expected, but, in management s assessment, may not be adequately represented in the quantitative analysis or the forecasts described above. Factors may include changes in lending policies and procedures, size and composition of the portfolio, experience and depth of management and the effect of external factors such as competition, legal and regulatory requirements, among others. The allowance is available for any loan that, in management s judgment, should be charged off. Although management uses the best information available, the level of the allowance for credit losses remains an estimate, which is subject to significant judgment and short-term change. Various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Bank s allowance for credit losses. Such agencies may require the Company to make additional provisions for credit losses based upon information available to them at the time of their examination. Furthermore, the majority of the Bank s loans are secured by real estate in the State of New York. Accordingly, the collectability of a substantial portion of the carrying value of the Bank s loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in local market conditions and any adverse economic conditions. Future adjustments to the provision for credit losses and allowance for credit losses may be necessary due to economic, operating, regulatory and other conditions beyond the Company s control. As presented below, the allowance for credit losses increased by 5.3 million, or 20.4 , to 31.0 million, or 1.73 of total loans at September 30, 2024, from 25.8 million, or 1.51 of total loans at September 30, 2023. The increase in the allowance was primarily due to an increased reserve of 9.9 million, which included approximately 9.6 million associated with a commercial office

 space participation loanas described above. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 also included charge-offs of approximately 4.1 million, including 3.9 million connected to the same commercial office space participation loan.

All other categories, in the aggregate, represented less than 0.01 of the net charge-offs to average loans outstanding. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, no category of loans had a ratio which exceeded 0.01 either individually, or in the aggregate.

 amortization and cash flow during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company sold and recorded a recovery of 1.9 million related to Signature Bank subordinated debt which was written-off during 2023. As part of the treatment, the Company evaluated the securities portfolio for an allowance and determined it was not necessary. Accordingly, the recovery resulted in a net credit to the ACL. We did not have held-to-maturity securities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Deposits The following table sets forth our total deposit account balances, by account type, at the dates indicated: 

At September 30, 2024 At December 31, 2023 Average Average Amount Percent Rate Amount Percent Rate (Dollars in thousands) Noninterest-bearing demand deposits 690,419 32.26 699,203 34.30 Interest bearing demand deposits 342,306 16.00 0.49 304,892 14.95 0.49 Money market deposits 707,065 33.04 2.27 584,976 28.69 2.04 Savings deposits 258,302 12.07 1.39 228,161 11.19 1.19 Certificates of deposit 141,931 6.63 4.06 221,517 10.87 4.57 Total 2,140,023 100.00 1.27 2,038,749 100.00 1.29 Total deposits increased 101.3 million, or 5.0 , to 2.1 billion at September 30, 2024 from 2.0 billion at December 31, 2023 driven by organic deposit growth which represented a continued focus on maintaining strong liquidity and commercial transaction accounts during the first nine months of 2024. Interest bearing demand deposits experienced a 37.4 million, or 12.3 , increase and money market deposits increased 122.1 million, while savings deposits increased by 30.1 million during the first nine months of 2024 primarily related to our continued strategic focus on business account activity. Non-interest-bearing demand deposits decreased 8.8 million primarily due to a shift of certain deposits into interest bearing accounts combined with normal business activity during the first nine months of 2024. At September 30, 2024, our core deposits (which includes all deposits except for certificates of deposit) totaled 2.0 billion, or 93.4 of our total deposits. Certificates of deposit decreased by 79.6 million, or 35.9 , mainly from reductions in brokered deposits during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024. We held approximately 100.0 million of brokered deposits (excluding reciprocal deposits obtained through the Certificate Deposit Account Registry Service (CDARS) and Insured Cash Sweep (ICS) networks) at September 30, 2024 as compared to 172.4 million at December 31, 2023. This decrease was the result of increased organic deposit activity during the period which allowed for maturity of the brokered deposits without replacement and reduced interest expense. Our reciprocal deposits obtained through the CDARS and ICS networks totaled 7.3 million and 95.2 million, respectively, at September 30, 2024 and the CDARS and ICS networks totaled 11.1 million and 99.5 million, respectively, at December 31, 2023. Uninsured deposits, net of fully collateralized municipal relationships, remained stable and represent approximately 39 of total deposits as of September 30, 2024 as compared to 37 of total deposits at December 31, 2023. Borrowings Our borrowings consist of both short-term and long-term borrowings and provide us with one of our sources of funding. Maintaining available borrowing capacity provides us with a contingent source of liquidity. Total borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York were 92.0 million at September 30, 2024 and 234.5 million at December 31, 2023 as we made the strategic decision to pay down Federal Home Loan Bank advances, short term, by approximately 142.5 million. This decrease represents a continued focus by management to reduce borrowings and the related interest expense by using lower-cost deposits for funding, which experienced growth during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We have the capacity to borrow an additional 491.6 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York as of September 30, 2024. During the first quarter of 2024, we also utilized 50 million of funding through the Bank Term Funding Program from the Federal Reserve under a one-year facility expiring in March 2025. That amount remains outstanding as of September 30, 2024. In September 2020, we issued 20.0 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed to floating subordinated notes (the 2020 Notes to certain institutional investors. The 2020 Notes are non-callable for five years, have a stated maturity of September 30, 2030, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.25 per year until September 30, 2025. From September 30, 2025 to the maturity date or early redemption date, the interest rate will reset quarterly to a level equal to the then current three-month SOFR plus 413 basis points,

 payable quarterly in arrears. Stockholders Equity Stockholders equity increased 27.7 million, to 193.1 million, at September 30, 2024 from 165.4 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was due mainly to an increase of 20.7 million in retained earnings, partially reduced by dividends and favorably impacted by a reduction of unrealized losses of approximately 9.7 million, net of taxes on the market value of investment securities recognized within the Company s equity as accumulated other comprehensive income(loss) AOCI ), net of taxes as a direct result of lower market rates.

 Average Balance Sheets and Related Yields and Rates The following tables present average balance sheet information, interest income, interest expense and the corresponding average yields earned and rates paid for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. No tax equivalent yield adjustments have been made, as the effects would be immaterial. The average balances are daily averages for loans, as presented. Interest income on loans includes the effects of discount accretion and net deferred loan origination costs accounted for as yield adjustments. Average deferred loan fees totaled 4.5 million and 5.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Average deferred loan fees totaled 4.7 million and 5.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Net income decreased 5.8 million, or 64.4 , to 3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 9.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was driven primarily by an increase of 6.4 million related to the provision for credit losses and an increase of 2.4 million in noninterest expense, partially offset by increases in net interest income of 467 thousand and noninterest income of 954 thousand during the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the same quarter in 2023. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 20.7 million, as compared to 21.4 million for the same period in 2023. The overall decrease was driven primarily by increased noninterest expense of 4.7 million coupled with an increase in the overall provision for credit losses of approximately 355 thousand offset by increased net interest income of 2.4 million and an increase in noninterest income of 1.9 million. The overall fluctuation of the provision for credit losses for the current nine month

 period included a 1.9 million recovery associated with Signature Bank subordinated debt which was written off during 2023 and recovered during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 as well as the additional reserve associated with the nonperforming office space participation loan as compared to the same prior year period. Interest Income. Interest income increased 1.3 million, or 4.4 , to 31.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 30.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by a 15 basis points increase in the average yield of interest-earning assets which grew from 5.06 during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 5.21 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of the higher interest rate environment during most of 2024. Over the same comparative period, the average balance of interest-earning assets increased by 32.4 million, or 1.4 , to 2.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income increased 8.8 million, or 10.2 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reaching 95.0 million from 86.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was driven by a 42.7 million increase in the balance of average interest-earning assets between the two periods. Within the average balance of interest-earning assets, the average balance of loans receivable (net of PPP loans) grew 73.2 million, or 4.4 , between the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. In addition, the average yield of interest-earning assets increased by 38 basis points from 4.94 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 5.32 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of the higher interest rate environment through most of 2024. Interest income on loans, net of PPP loans, increased by 1.7 million, or 6.9 , to 26.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 24.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest income on loans was primarily due to the increase in the average balance of loans (net of PPP loans) and an increase in the average yield on loans. The average balance of loans increased by 62.2 million, or 3.7 , to 1.8 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the average balance of loans was due to 62.2 million of net average loan growth during the third quarter coupled with stability in commercial real estate loan balances as well as growth in our consumer loan portfolio. The average yield on loans, excluding PPP loans, increased by 17 basis points to 5.94 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.77 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of the higher interest rate environment and management s continued focus on disciplined loan pricing. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest income on loans increased by 8.4 million, or 11.9 , reaching 78.8 million as compared to 70.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest income on loans represents the impact of growth in average loan balances (net of PPP loans) of 73.2 million between the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024. The increase in average loans outstanding was due mainly to the third quarter increase in the commercial real estate and consumer segments of the loan portfolio. This increase in production was also coupled with an increase in average yield on loans, excluding PPP loans, for the nine month periods from 5.64 in 2023 to 6.02 in 2024. The increase in the average yield on loans was driven by the effect of the higher interest rate environment during 2023 and the majority of the first nine months of 2024 as well as management s continued focus on disciplined loan pricing. Interest income on securities decreased by 214 thousand to 3.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in interest income on securities was driven primarily by a decrease in the average balance of securities outstanding during the current period due to continued maturities as well as a result of the Signature Bank subordinated debt writeoff during 2023. The average balance of securities decreased by 32.5 million, or 6.6 , to 463.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 495.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average yield on investment securities was relatively flat with a one basis point increase overall from 2.77 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 2.78 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The stability and slight increase in the average yield on securities reflected the continued maturity of lower yielding investments during the current period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest income on securities decreased by 527 thousand, or 5.0 , to 10.0 million during the period from 10.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in interest income on securities was due to a decrease in the average balance of securities during the current period. The average balance of securities decreased by 43.3 million, or 8.4 , to 470.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 514.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to continued maturities as well as the impact of the Signature Bank subordinated debt writeoff during 2023.

 months ended September 30, 2023 to 2.84 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in the average yield on securities was primarily related to the maturity of lower yielding securities during 2023 and the first nine months of 2024. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased 870 thousand, or 11.5 , to 8.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 7.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increased interest expense continues to be driven primarily by the continued effect of the higher interest rate environment and the impact on deposit costs as well as funding costs during the quarter. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liablities increased 17 basis points to 2.12 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.95 for the three month period ended September 30, 2023. The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 40.5 million, or 2.6 , and was approximately 1.6 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense increased 6.4million, or 31.9 , to 26.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 20.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense reflects the higher interest rate environment and the continuing effect on deposit and funding costs during the first nine months of 2024. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased 46 basis points to 2.19 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.73 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2023. The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 55.4 million, or 3.6 , to 1.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits increased by 1.2 million to 6.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense on interest-bearing deposits was due mainly to the continued increase in the average cost of deposits. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 27 basis points to 1.83 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.56 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits increased due to the continued impact of the higher interest rate environment on deposit accounts. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased by 53.8 million, or 3.9 , to 1.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily as a result of the increases in the average balances of interest-bearing demand deposits, money market accounts, and savings accounts. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense on interest-bearing deposits increased by 7.9 million, or 61.2 , to 20.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 13.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense on interest-bearing deposits for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same prior year period represents the effect of the higher interest rate environment on the average cost of deposits coupled with higher average balances of interest bearing deposits. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 63 basis points to 1.91 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.28 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased by 95.8 million, or 7.1 , to 1.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily as a result of the increases in the average balances of certificates of deposit, interest-bearing demand deposits and money market accounts. We also expensed a relatively level amount of approximately 230 thousand in interest expense for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 related to the issuance in September 2020 of 20.0 million in outstanding subordinated notes, which carries an interest rate of 4.25 . In addition, we expensed approximately 691 thousand in interest expense for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. These flat interest costs represent the debt service required as part of the 2020 subordinated notes. The interest expense related to borrowings in the third quarter of 2024 decreased to 1.6 million at an average cost of 4.97 as compared to interest expense of 1.9 million at an average cost of 5.38 for the same period in 2023. The third quarter 2024 average FHLB and other borrowings decreased to 127.2 million compared to 140.6 million of average FHLB and other borrowing in the same quarter of 2023. The decrease in average borrowings was the direct result of paydowns driven by increased deposits and less use of cash during the current period. Management was able to replace higher cost FHLB borrowings with lower cost borrowings as rates were adjusted lower and reduce interest expense during the current period. Although borrowings remain a potential source of strategic funding for the Company, the reduction in borrowings during the quarter reflects the ability of the Company to increase deposits and strategically reduce associated interest costs. The interest expense related to FHLB and other borrowing for the first nine months of 2024 decreased to 4.7 million as compared to 6.3 million for the first nine months of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, average FHLB and other

 borrowings decreased to 123.9 million with an average cost of 5.09 compared to 164.4 million of average FHLB and other borrowings with an average cost of 5.12 for the same period in 2023. The decrease in average borrowings was the direct result of paydowns driven by increased deposits and less use of cash during the current period. Net Interest Income . Net interest income increased 467 thousand, or 2.1 , to 23.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 22.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to the increase in income from interest earning assets outpacing the growth of interest costs associated with interest bearing liabilities. Net interest rate spread decreased slightly by one basis point to 3.10 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.11 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting a 15 basis points increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets offset by a 17 basis points increase in the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The net interest margin increased three basis points to 3.81 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.78 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to the tightening interest rate environment as well as the impact of managed funding and deposit costs during the period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income increased 2.5 million, or 3.7 , to 68.7 million from 66.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to an increase in net interest margin for the current period. The net interest margin increased six basis points to 3.85 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.79 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest rate spread decreased by eight basis points to 3.13 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.21 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Provision for Credit Losses. The Company recognized a provision for credit losses of 7.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 837 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increased provision was primarily driven by a 5.6 million reserve associated with a specific nonaccrual commercial real estate loan participation identified during the second quarter of 2024. Additionally, the provision for the quarter included the impact of the methodology associated with estimated lifetime losses and the increase in loans closed. The allowance for credit losses to total loans was 1.73 as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 29 basis points, or 20.1 , versus 1.44 as of December 31, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for credit losses totaled 7.8 million as compared to 7.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflected the recognition of a 1.9 million recovery associated with the 2023 write off of the Signature Bank subordinated debt in the amount of 5.0 million made during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as well as the additional provision related to a nonaccrual commercial real estate loan participation identified during the second quarter of 2024. Total participation and syndicated loans represent approximately 7.3 of total loans at September 30, 2024. Noninterest Income. Noninterest income information is as follows:

Our Wealth Management division revenues, which include our Trust and Asset Management businesses also experienced growth and represented a 20.1 increase quarter-over-quarter, to 3.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 2.6 million for the third quarter of 2023 as a result of continued growth in asset values during the current period. During the same period, assets-under-management increased to 1.8 billion at September 30, 2024 from 1.4 billion at September 30, 2023.

Our Wealth Management division revenues increased and represented 19.1 growth reaching 9.0 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 from 7.5 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2023 as a result of continued growth in asset values and new customers during 2024. Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense information is as follows:

The increase in non-interest expense for the current three-month period was due primarily to continued investment in overall Company growth, including increases in professional fees associated with certain corporate initiatives, salaries and benefit costs, and information technology. Our efficiency ratio was 58.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 52.8 for the same period in 2023. Non-interest expense was 46.7 million for the first nine months of 2024, reflecting an increase of approximately 4.7 million, or 11.1 , as compared to 42.1 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in non-interest expense for the nine month period was also due to continued investment in overall Company growth, primarily, increases in salaries and benefit costs, professional fees, and information technology. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our efficiency ratio was 58.2 as compared to 55.4 for the same period in 2023. Provision for Income Tax. Our provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 788 thousand, compared to approximately 2.3 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease for the current period was directly related to lower income before income taxes during the quarter. Our effective tax rate for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 19.7 , as compared to 20.0 for the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our provision for income taxes was 5.1 million, approximately the same as for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The relatively flat trend for the current period was due to similar levels of income before income taxes during the current nine month period. Our effective tax rate for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 19.9 , as compared to 19.3 for the same period in 2023. The growth of the effective tax rate for the 2024 nine month period was due to the increase in proportion of pre-tax income compared with non-taxable revenue (tax-exempt interest income and earnings on bank owned life insurance) during 2024 as compared to 2023. Financial Position and Results of Operations of our Wealth Management Business Segment We conduct our business through two business segments: (1) our banking business segment, which involves the delivery of loan and deposit products to our customers through Orange Bank Trust Company; and (2) our wealth management business segment, which includes asset management and trust services to individuals and institutions through HVIA and Orange Bank Trust Company that provides trust and investment management fee income.

This includes assets held at both Orange Bank Trust Company and HVIA at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our expenses related to our wealth management business segment, which we record as noninterest expense, increased 365 thousand, or 20.1 , to 2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in expenses was primarily due to continued expansion of the business unit and investment in technology during the period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our expenses related to our wealth management business segment increased 752 thousand or 13.0 , to 6.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in expenses was primarily due to the growth of the business unit and its related operations as well as costs associated with certain managed trust assets. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity. Liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short-term nature. Our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, loan repayments and maturities and sales of securities. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition.

 Our most liquid assets are cash and due from banks. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, cash and due from banks totaled 160.9 million and 147.4 million, respectively. Securities classified as available-for-sale, which provide additional sources of liquidity, totaled 469.5 million at September 30, 2024 and 489.9 million at December 31, 2023. Certificates of deposit due within one year of September 30, 2024 totaled 137.8 million, or 96.5 of total certificates of deposit. The largest concentration of certificates of deposit represented brokered deposits in the amount of 100.0 million for diversified funding purposes. We participate in IntraFi Network, allowing us to provide access to multi-million-dollar FDIC deposit insurance protection on deposits for customers, businesses and public entities. We can elect to sell or repurchase this funding as reciprocal deposits from other IntraFi Network banks depending on our funding needs. At September 30, 2024, we had a total of 102.5 million of IntraFi Network deposits, all of which were repurchased as reciprocal deposits from the IntraFi Network. Although customer deposits remain our preferred source of funds, maintaining back up sources of liquidity is part of our prudent liquidity risk management practices. We have the ability to borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York FRB as well as other correspondent banks. At September 30, 2024, we had a total capacity of 577.6 million at the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, of which 76.0 million was used to collateralize municipal deposits, and 10.0 million was utilized for long-term advances. At September 30, 2024, we also had a 4.5 million collateralized line of credit from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York discount window with no outstanding balance. Additionally, we utilized 50 million of funding through the Bank Term Funding Program from the FRB under a one-year facility expiring in March 2025. We also had a total of 20.0 million of discretionary lines of credit at September 30, 2024 with no outstanding balance. We have a borrowing agreement with Atlantic Community Bankers Bank ACBB to provide short-term borrowings of 5.0 million at September 30, 2024. There were no outstanding borrowings with ACBB at September 30, 2024. Our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was 21.8 million and 28.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities, which consists primarily of disbursements for loan originations and the purchase of securities, offset by principal collections on loans, proceeds from the sale of securities and proceeds from maturing securities and pay downs on securities, was 12.6 million and 106.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities, consisting of activity in deposit accounts and borrowings, was 4.4 million and 150.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We remain committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor and evaluate our liquidity position daily. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Based on our deposit growth and retention, current pricing strategy and regulatory restrictions, we have the ability to retain and increase a substantial portion of maturing time deposits, and we can supplement our funding with borrowings in the event that we allow these deposits to run off at maturity. Capital Resources. We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the FRB and the NYSDFS. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we exceeded all applicable regulatory capital requirements, and were considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines. See Note 10 to the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for actual and required capital amounts and ratios at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. We are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, which involve elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. Our exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of the instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. At September 30, 2024, we had 429.1 million in loan commitments outstanding. We also had 15.5 million in standby letters of credit at September 30, 2024.

 Effect of Inflation and Changing Prices The consolidated financial statements and related financial data included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk A smaller reporting company is not required to provide the information related to this item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures An Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures . As of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management was required to apply judgment in evaluating its controls and procedures. Based on their evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act )) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations are operating in an effective manner. Internal control over financial reporting . There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings As of September 30, 2024, the Company is not currently a named party in a legal proceeding, the outcome of which would have an adverse material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. On October 25, 2024, the Bank filed a civil complaint in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against the lead lender, Valley National Bank, of the non-performing commercial real estate loan participation noted above. This action cites breach of contract and other claims related to the participation agreement with the lead lender. The lawsuit requests damages and demands repurchase by the lead lender of the participated loan amount in accordance with the rights available under the terms of the participation agreement. Item 1A. Risk Factors There has been no material change to Risk Factors as disclosed in the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 29, 2024. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Not applicable.
