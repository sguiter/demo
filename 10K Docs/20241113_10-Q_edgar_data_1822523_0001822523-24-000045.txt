 Changes in market yields, revenue multiples, and recovery rates may change the fair value of certain of the Company s loans. Generally, an increase in market yields may result in a decrease in the fair value of certain of the Company s loans, while a decrease in revenue multiples and recovery rates may result in a decrease in the fair value of certain of the Company s loans. 
 Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of loans that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company s loans may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of the Company s loans may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such loans and may differ materially from the values that the Company may ultimately realize. Further, such loans are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If the Company was required to liquidate a loan in a forced or liquidation sale, it could realize significantly less than the value at which the Company has recorded it. 
 In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the loans may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these loans to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected in the valuations currently assigned.

 Overview 
 Advanced Flower Capital Inc. is an institutional lender that was founded in July 2020 by a veteran team of investment professionals. We primarily originate, structure, underwrite, invest in and manage senior secured loans and other types of mortgage loans and debt securities, with a specialization in loans to cannabis industry operators in states that have legalized medical and/or adult-use cannabis. Our investment guidelines primarily relate to deploying capital in attractive lending opportunities to state law-compliant cannabis operators, typically secured by real estate, cash flows and license value. 
 Our objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns over time through cash distributions and capital appreciation primarily by providing loans to real estate developers and state law compliant cannabis companies. The loans we originate are primarily structured as senior loans typically secured by real estate, equipment, cashflows and the value associated with licenses (where applicable) and/or other assets of the loan parties to the extent permitted by applicable laws and the regulations governing such loan parties. Some of our cannabis-related borrowers have their equity securities listed for public trading on the Canadian Securities Exchange CSE in Canada and/or over-the-counter OTC in the United States. 
 As states continue to legalize cannabis for medical and adult-use, an increasing number of companies operating in the cannabis industry need financing. Due to the current capital constrained cannabis market, which does not typically have access to traditional bank financing, we believe we continue to be well positioned to act as a prudent financing source to cannabis industry operators given our stringent underwriting criteria, size and scale of operations and institutional infrastructure.

 We are a Maryland corporation and externally managed by AFC Management, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (our Manager ), pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Management Agreement, dated January 14, 2021, by and between the Company and AFC Management, LLC (as amended from time to time, the Management Agreement ). We commenced operations on July 31, 2020 and completed our initial public offering IPO in March 2021. 
 We have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (a REIT under Section 856 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2020. We believe that we have qualified as a REIT and that our current and proposed method of operation will enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT. However, no assurances can be given that our beliefs or expectations will be fulfilled, since qualification as a REIT depends on us continuing to satisfy numerous asset, income and distribution tests, which in turn depends, in part, on our operating results and ability to obtain financing. We also intend to operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as amended (the Investment Company Act ). 
 Our wholly-owned subsidiary, AFCG TRS1, LLC TRS1 ), operates as a taxable REIT subsidiary (a TRS ). TRS1 began operating in July 2021. The financial statements of TRS1 are consolidated within our consolidated financial statements. 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act JOBS Act ), and we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period. As a result, we will not be subject to the same implementation timing for new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, which may make comparison of our financials to those of other public companies more difficult. 
 We could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years from our initial public offering, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed 1.235 billion, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700.0 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period. 
 Spin-Off 
 On February 22, 2024, we announced a plan to separate into two independent, publicly traded companies - one focused on providing institutional loans to state law compliant cannabis operators in the U.S., the other an institutional commercial real estate lender focused on the Southern United States. Prior to the Spin-Off, Sunrise Realty Trust, Inc. SUNS held our CRE portfolio as our wholly-owned subsidiary. On July 9, 2024, we completed the separation of our CRE portfolio through the spin-off of SUNS into an independent, publicly traded REIT (the Spin-Off through a pro-rata distribution of all of the outstanding shares of SUNS common stock to our shareholders of record as of the close of business on July 8, 2024 (the Record Date ). Our shareholders of record as of the Record Date received one share of SUNS common stock for every three shares of our common stock held as of the Record Date. We retained no ownership interest in SUNS following the Spin-Off. In connection with the Spin-Off, the operating results of the SUNS business through the date of the Spin-Off are reported in net income from discontinued operations, net of tax in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. The related assets and liabilities are reported as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheets. Cash flows from the Company s discontinued operations are presented as such in the consolidated statements of cash flows for all periods presented.

 Recent Developments 
 In October 2024, we entered into a 41.0 million senior secured credit facility with Private Company R, which was fully funded at closing. The loan was originated at a discount of 2.0 and matures November 1, 2027. The loan bears interest at SOFR plus a 7.5 spread, subject to a SOFR floor of 4.5 .

 Key Financial Measures and Indicators 
 As a commercial real estate finance company, we believe the key financial measures and indicators for our business are Distributable Earnings, book value per share and dividends declared per share.

Index 

 Non-GAAP Metrics 
 Distributable Earnings 
 In addition to using certain financial metrics prepared in accordance with GAAP to evaluate our performance, we also use Distributable Earnings to evaluate our performance excluding the effects of certain transactions and GAAP adjustments we believe are not necessarily indicative of our current loan activity and operations. Distributable Earnings is a measure that is not prepared in accordance with GAAP. We use these non-GAAP financial measures both to explain our results to shareholders and the investment community and in the internal evaluation and management of our businesses. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures and the information they provide are useful to investors since these measures permit investors and shareholders to assess the overall performance of our business using the same tools that our management uses to evaluate our past performance and prospects for future performance. The determination of Distributable Earnings is substantially similar to the determination of Core Earnings under our Management Agreement, provided that Core Earnings is a component of the calculation of any Incentive Compensation earned under the Management Agreement for the applicable time period, and thus Core Earnings is calculated without giving effect to Incentive Compensation expense, while the calculation of Distributable Earnings accounts for any Incentive Compensation earned for such time period. 
 We define Distributable Earnings as, for a specified period, the net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding (i) stock-based compensation expense, (ii) depreciation and amortization, (iii) any unrealized gains, losses or other non-cash items recorded in net income (loss) for the period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income (loss); provided that Distributable Earnings does not exclude, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as OID, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash, (iv) (decrease) increase in provision for current expected credit losses, (v) TRS (income) loss, net of any dividends received from TRS and (vi) one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain non-cash charges, in each case after discussions between our Manager and our independent directors and after approval by a majority of such independent directors. 
 We believe providing Distributable Earnings on a supplemental basis to our net income as determined in accordance with GAAP is helpful to shareholders in assessing the overall performance of our business. As a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90 of our annual REIT taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, and to pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we annually distribute less than 100 of such taxable income. Given these requirements and our belief that dividends are generally one of the principal reasons that shareholders invest in our common stock, we generally intend to attempt to pay dividends to our shareholders in an amount at least equal to such REIT taxable income, if and to the extent authorized by our Board. Distributable Earnings is one of many factors considered by our Board in authorizing dividends and, while not a direct measure of net taxable income, over time, the measure can be considered a useful indicator of our dividends. 
 Distributable Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as a substitute for GAAP net income. We caution readers that our methodology for calculating Distributable Earnings may differ from the methodologies employed by other REITs to calculate the same or similar supplemental performance measures, and as a result, our reported Distributable Earnings may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other REITs.

 Book Value Per Share 
 We believe that book value per share is helpful to shareholders in evaluating our growth as we scale our equity capital base and continue to invest in our target investments. The book value per share of our common stock as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was approximately 9.42 and 15.64, respectively. On July 9, 2024, we completed the Spin-Off of SUNS, which had a book value of approximately 114.8 million, or 5.55 per share, on the Distribution Date. In connection with the Spin-Off, we recognized a reduction to additional paid-in capital of approximately 114.8 million related to the transfer of certain assets and liabilities associated with our CRE business to SUNS. 
 
 Factors Impacting our Operating Results 
 The results of our operations are affected by a number of factors and primarily depend on, among other things, the level of our net interest margin, the market value of our assets and the supply of, and demand for, commercial real estate debt and other financial assets in the marketplace. Our net interest margin, which includes the accretion and amortization of OID, is recognized based on the contractual rate and the outstanding principal balance of the loans we originate. Interest rates will vary according to the type of loan, conditions in the financial markets, creditworthiness of our borrowers, competition and other factors, some of which cannot be predicted with any certainty. Our operating results may also be impacted by credit losses in excess of initial anticipations or unanticipated credit events experienced by our borrowers. 
 
 Results of Operations f or the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Our net income from continuing operations allocable to our common shareholders for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was approximately 1.2 million and 14.9 million, or 0.05 and 0.71 per basic weighted average common share from continuing operations, respectively, compared to net income from continuing operations allocable to our common shareholders of approximately 8.0 million and 30.1 million, or 0.39 and 1.47 per basic weighted average common share from continuing operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 39 

Index 

 Interest income decreased approximately (6.3) million, or (37.8) , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was driven by lower interest income of approximately 4.8) million related to Private Company A and Private Company K on nonaccrual status for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, lower interest income of approximately 4.1) million related to less capital deployed, partially offset by higher interest income of approximately 1.7 million related to Subsidiary of Private Company G received in cash, higher fee income of approximately 0.4 million driven by the prepayment of our investment in Subsidiary of Public Company M and higher OID income of approximately 0.4 million due to the acceleration of unaccreted OID related to the prepayment of our in investment in Subsidiary of Public Company M during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. While Subsidiary of Private Company G is currently on nonaccrual and was on nonaccrual for two out of three months in the prior period, cash received exceeded prior year income for this borrower. 
 Interest income decreased approximately (10.2) million, or (19.3) , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was driven by lower interest income of approximately 13.5) million driven by Subsidiary of Private Company G, Private Company K and Private Company A placed on nonaccrual status during fiscal year 2024, lower interest income of approximately 4.4) million driven by less capital deployed relating to loan exits and prepayments, partially offset by higher fee income of approximately 3.7 million driven by loan exits and prepayments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and higher OID income of approximately 4.0 million due to the acceleration of unaccreted OID of current year loan exits and prepayments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Interest expense increased approximately 39.8 thousand, or 2.6 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to an increase in borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Interest expense decreased approximately (27.7) thousand, or (0.6) , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 driven by lower interest incurred on the 2027 Senior Notes due to a weighted average decrease in the 2027 Senior Notes principal outstanding of approximately (2.5) million, or (2.7) , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This relates to the repurchase of 10.0 million of our 2027 Senior Notes during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. No repurchases took place during the same period in 2024. This is partially offset by an increase in interest expense relating to the Revolving Credit Facility due to an increase in borrowings period over period. 
 Management fees decreased approximately (0.2) million, or (22.7) , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 driven by lower outside fees earned and lower equity attributable to the Spin-Off of SUNS completed on July 9, 2024. In connection with the Spin-Off, we recognized a reduction to additional paid-in capital of approximately 114.8 million. Incentive fees decreased approximately (2.4) million, or (90.4) , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by lower Core Earnings (as defined in the Management Agreement). 
 Management fees increased approximately 0.1 million, or 3.5 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 driven by lower outside fees earned and offset by lower equity attributable to the Spin-Off of SUNS completed on July 9, 2024. In connection with the Spin-Off, we recognized a reduction to additional paid-in capital of approximately 114.8 million. Incentive fees decreased approximately (2.3) million, or (28.7) , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven by lower Core Earnings (as defined in the Management Agreement). 
 General and administrative expenses decreased approximately (0.1) million, or (13.1) , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 General and administrative expenses decreased approximately (1.1) million, or (27.7) , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to severance expense incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 attributable to the departure of our former Chief Financial Officer of approximately 0.7 million. No severance expense was incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Stock-based compensation decreased approximately (0.1) million, or (25.6) , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was driven by accelerated vesting of restricted stock awards in the prior period.

Index 

 Stock-based compensation increased approximately 0.4 million, or 60.4 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was driven by additional equity awards granted in January 2024. 
 Professional fees increased approximately 0.1 million, or 41.3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Prior to the third quarter of 2024, Spin-Off costs were previously presented within professional fees in the consolidated statements of operations and are now included in the measurement and presentation of discontinued operations for all periods presented. 
 Professional fees increased approximately 0.1 million, or 8.4 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Prior to the third quarter of 2024, Spin-Off costs were previously presented within professional fees in the consolidated statements of operations and are now included in the measurement and presentation of discontinued operations for all periods presented. 
 The net change in realized gains (losses) on investments was approximately 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by the change in realized loss relating to the maturity of our loan to Public Company A without repayment in the prior period. 
 The net change in realized gains (losses) on investments was approximately 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven by the change in realized losses relating to separate sales of our investment in Subsidiary of Public Company M and realized loss relating to our loan to Public Company A during such periods. 
 Investments in loans held at fair value are recorded on the trade date at cost, which reflects the amount of principal funded net of any original issue discounts. An unrealized gain arises when the fair value of the loan portfolio exceeds its cost and an unrealized loss arises when the fair value of the loan portfolio is less than its cost. The net change in unrealized gain (loss) of approximately (4.6) million and 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and (9.7) million and (1.2) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was mainly driven by the sale of our loan with Private Company B with an unrealized loss that was recovered, maturity of our loan with Public Company A with an unrealized loss that was realized, as well as the net change in the valuation of the loans, which was impacted by changes in market yields, revenue multiples, and recovery rates. 
 The gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt was zero for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt decreased approximately (2.0) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was driven by the repurchase of 10.0 million of our 2027 Senior Notes during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. No repurchases took place during the same period in 2024.

 Provision for Current Expected Credit Losses 
 The provision for current expected credit losses decreased approximately (0.9) million, or (82.8) , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 . The provision for current expected credit losses decreased approximately (1.3) million, or (867.9) , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The balance as of September 30, 2024 was approximatel y 25.3 million , or 10.70 , of our total loans held at carrying value and loan receivable held at carrying value balance of approximately 236.3 million and was bifurcated between (i) the current expected credit loss reserve (contra-asset) related to outstanding balances on loans held at carrying value and loan receivable held at carrying value of approximately 25.1 million and (ii) a liability for unfunded commitments of approximately 0.2 million . The balance as of September 30, 2023 was approximately 14.4 million, or 4.66 , of our total loans held at carrying value and loan receivable held at carrying value balance of approximately 310.1 million and was bifurcated between (i) the current expected credit loss reserve (contra-asset) related to outstanding balances on loans held at carrying value and loan receivable held at carrying value of approximately 14.3 million and (ii) a liability for unfunded commitments of approximately 0.2 million. The liability is based on the unfunded portion of loan commitments over the full contractual period over which we are exposed to credit risk through a current obligation to extend credit. Management considered the likelihood that funding will occur, and if funded, the expected credit loss on the funded portion. We continuously evaluate the credit quality of each loan by assessing the risk factors of each loan. The change in the provision for current expected credit losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to changes in macroeconomic factors, changes to the loan portfolio including new commitments and repayments, borrower payment status, and changes in other data points we use in estimating the reserve.

 (1) All loans originated prior to July 31, 2020 were purchased from an affiliated entity at fair value which approximated accreted and/or amortized cost plus accrued interest on July 31, 2020. 
 (2) Estimated YTM includes a variety of fees and features that affect the total yield, which may include, but is not limited to, OID, exit fees, prepayment fees, unused fees and contingent features. OID is recognized as a discount to the funded loan principal and is accreted to income over the term of the loan. Loans originated before July 31, 2020 were acquired by us, net of unaccreted OID, which we accrete to income over the remaining term of the loan. In some cases, additional OID is recognized from additional purchase discounts attributed to the fair value of equity positions that were separated from the loans prior to our acquisition of such loans.

Index 

 The estimated YTM calculations require management to make estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to, the timing and amounts of loan draws on delayed draw loans, the timing and collectability of exit fees, the probability and timing of prepayments and the probability of contingent features occurring. For example, certain credit agreements contain provisions pursuant to which certain PIK interest rates and fees earned by us under such credit agreements will decrease upon the satisfaction of certain specified criteria which we believe may improve the risk profile of the applicable borrower. To be conservative, we have not assumed any prepayment penalties or early payoffs in our estimated YTM calculation. Estimated YTM is based on current management estimates and assumptions, which may change. Estimated YTM is calculated using the interest rate as of September 30, 2024 applied through maturity. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. 
 (3) Estimated YTM for the loan with Private Company A is enhanced by purchase discounts attributed to the fair value of equity warrants that were separated from the loan prior to our acquisition of such loan. The purchase discounts accrete to income over the respective remaining terms of the applicable loan. 
 (4) Effective October 1, 2022, Public Company A equipment loan receivable was placed on nonaccrual status. 
 (5) Cash interest and PIK interest rates for Private Company A represent a blended rate of differing cash interest and PIK interest rates applicable to each of the tranches to which the Company is a lender under the senior secured term loan credit facility with Private Company A (as may be amended, restated, and supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the Private Company A Credit Facility ). In October 2023, AFC Agent delivered a notice of default to Private Company A based on certain financial and other covenant defaults and began charging additional default interest of 5.0 , beginning as of July 1, 2023, in accordance with the terms of the Private Company A Credit Facility. Effective March 1, 2024, Private Company A was placed on nonaccrual status. The maturity date passed on the credit facility to Private Company A without repayment. In November 2023, Private Company A was placed into receivership to maintain the borrower s operations and maximize value for the benefit of its creditors. The court-appointed receiver is determining the amount of principal payments the borrower is able to repay either from operations or from sale of collateral assets on a monthly basis. 
 (6) Effective March 2024, pursuant to the forbearance agreement with Subsidiary of Private Company G, Subsidiary of Private Company G transitioned from a floating interest rate tied to U.S. prime rate to a fixed interest rate. Effective December 1, 2023, the Company placed the borrower on nonaccrual status. 
 (7) As amended by the forbearance agreement entered into in March 2024, between 20.0 and 80.0 of the monthly cash interest was paid in kind from December 1, 2023 to June 1, 2024. Effective December 1, 2023, the Company placed the borrower on nonaccrual status. 
 (8) Quarterly cash interest is paid in kind from closing to February 1, 2024 and then payable in cash thereafter. 
 (9) Pursuant to the first amendment to the credit agreement entered into in August 2024, interest was paid in kind from July 1, 2024 to August 31, 2024 and then payable in cash thereafter. 
 (10) The interest and PIK subtotal rates are weighted average rates. 
 Loans Held for Investment at Fair Value

 Collateral Overview 
 Our loans are typically secured by various types of assets of our borrowers, including real property and certain personal property, such as cashflows and the value associated with licenses (where applicable), equipment, and other assets to the extent permitted by applicable laws and the regulations governing our borrowers. 
 With respect to our loans to cannabis operators, we do not have liens on cannabis inventory and are generally restricted from taking ownership of state licenses by current statutory prohibitions and exchange listing standards. The documents governing our loans also include a variety of provisions intended to provide remedies against the value associated with licenses. For example, some loan documents require a grant of a security interest in all property of the entities holding licenses to the extent not prohibited by applicable law or regulations (or requiring regulatory approval), equity pledges of entities holding licenses, receivership remedies and/or other remedies to secure the value associated with the borrowers licenses. Upon default of a loan, we may seek to sell the loan to a third party or have an affiliate or a third party work with the borrower to have the borrower sell collateral securing the loan to a third party or institute a foreclosure proceeding to have such collateral sold, in each case, to generate funds towards the payoff of the loan. While we believe that the appraised value of any real estate assets or other collateral securing our loans may impact the amount of the recovery in each such scenario, the amount of any such recovery from the sale of such real estate or other collateral may be less than the appraised value of such collateral and the sale of such collateral may not be sufficient to pay off the remaining balance on the defaulted loan. Becoming the holder of a license through foreclosure or otherwise, the sale of a license or other realization of the value of licenses requires the approval of regulatory authorities. As of September 30, 2024, our portfolio of assets held outside of TRS1 had a weighted average real estate collateral coverage of approximately 1.0 times our aggregate committed principal amount of such loans, with the real estate collateral coverage for each of our loans measured as of the time of closing for such loan and based on various sources of data available at such time. We calculate our weighted average real estate collateral coverage by estimating the underlying value of our real estate collateral based on various objective and subjective factors, including, without limitation, third-party appraisals, total cost basis of the subject property and/or our own internal estimates. 
 46 

Index 

 We may pursue a sale of a defaulted loan if we believe that a sale would yield higher proceeds or that a sale could be accomplished more quickly than a foreclosure proceeding while yielding proceeds comparable to what would be expected from a foreclosure sale. To the extent that we determine that the proceeds are more likely to be maximized through instituting a foreclosure sale or through taking title to the underlying collateral, we will be subject to the rules and regulations under state law that govern foreclosure sales and Nasdaq listing standards that do not permit us to take title to real estate while it is involved in commercial sales of cannabis. In addition, the sale of the collateral securing our loans may be difficult and even for loans to cannabis operators, the collateral securing our loans may be sold to a party outside of the cannabis industry. Therefore, any appraisal-based value of our real estate and other collateral may not equal the value of such collateral if it were to be sold to a third party in a foreclosure or similar proceeding. We may seek to sell a defaulted loan prior to commencing a foreclosure proceeding or during a foreclosure proceeding to a purchaser that is not required to comply with Nasdaq listing standards. We believe a third-party purchaser that is not subject to Nasdaq listing standards may be able to realize greater value from real estate and other collateral securing our loans with respect to loans to cannabis operators. However, we can provide no assurances that a third party would buy such loans or that the sales price of such loans would be sufficient to recover the outstanding principal balance, accrued interest, and fees. We will not own real estate as long as it is used in the commercial sale of cannabis due to current statutory prohibitions and exchange listing standards, which may delay or limit our remedies in the event that any of our borrowers default under the terms of their loans with us. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund and maintain our assets and operations, make distributions to our shareholders and meet other general business needs. We use significant cash to purchase our target investments, repay principal and interest on our borrowings, make distributions to our shareholders and fund our operations. The sources of financing for our target investments are described below. 
 Our primary sources of cash generally consist of unused borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility, the net proceeds of future debt or equity offerings, including in connection with the ATM Program, payments of principal and interest we receive on our portfolio of assets and cash generated from our operating results. 
 Our net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of approximately 19.3 million was less than our dividend payments of 32.8 million made during the same period due to earned OID of 7.1 million and PIK repayments of 5.5 million related to the exits from Private Company I, Private Company C and Private Company B during such period. OID relates to cash withheld by the Company upon funding of its investments and is included under the Supplemental disclosure of non-cash activity on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all of our cash was unrestricted and totaled approximately 122.2 million and 90.4 million, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we believe that our cash on hand, capacity available under our line of credit and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy the operating requirements of our business through at least the next twelve months. 
 Capital Markets 
 Our Shelf Registration Statement became effective on April 18, 2022, allowing us to sell, from time to time in one or more offerings, up to 1.0 billion of our securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and rights (including as part of a unit) to purchase shares of our common stock or preferred stock. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of any offering. We may also access liquidity through our ATM Program, which was established in April 2022, pursuant to which we may sell, from time to time, up to 75.0 million of our common stock. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold an aggregate of 1,214,953 shares of our common stock under the Sales Agreement at a weighted average price of 10.39 per share, generating net proceeds of approximately 12.2 million. As of September 30, 2024, our remaining authorization under the Sales Agreement was approximately 51.0 million. 
 Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we sold an aggregate of 70,630 shares of our common stock under the Sales Agreement at a weighted average price of 9.99 per share, generating net proceeds of approximately 0.7 million. As of November 13, 2024, our remaining authorization under the Sales Agreement was approximately 50.3 million.

Index 

 We may seek to raise further equity capital and issue debt securities in order to fund our future investments in loans. As the cannabis industry continues to evolve and to the extent that additional states legalize cannabis, the demand for capital continues to increase as operators seek to enter and build out new markets. We expect the principal amount of the loans we originate for cannabis operators to increase. We also expect our expanded investment focus to require additional capital. As a result, we expect we will need to raise additional equity and/or debt funds to increase our liquidity in the near future. 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 On April 29, 2022, we entered into the Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, we had 60.0 million of borrowings outstanding and zero availability under our Revolving Credit Agreement, which may be borrowed, repaid and redrawn, subject to a borrowing base based on eligible loan obligations held by us and subject to the satisfaction of other conditions provided under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility contains aggregate commitments of 60.0 million from two FDIC-insured banking institutions, which may be increased to up to 100.0 million in aggregate (subject to available borrowing base and additional commitments), and contains a maturity date of April 29, 2025. Interest is payable on the Revolving Credit Facility at the greater of (1) the applicable base rate plus 0.50 and (2) 4.50 , as provided in the Revolving Credit Agreement, payable in cash in arrears. Upon entering into the Revolving Credit Agreement, w e incurred a one-time commitment fee expense of approximately 0.5 million, which is amortized over the life of the facility. Commencing on the six-month anniversary of the closing date, the Revolving Credit Facility has an unused line fee of 0.25 per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears, which is included within interest expense in our unaudited interim consolidated statements of operations. Based on the terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement, our estimated average cash balance will exceed the minimum balance required to waive the unused line fee and as such, we did not incur an unused line fee for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are secured by certain assets of ours comprising of or relating to loan obligations designated for inclusion in the borrowing base. In addition, we are subject to various financial and other covenants, including: (1) liquidity of at least 5.0 million, (2) annual debt service coverage of at least 1.50 to 1.0 and (3) secured debt not to exceed 25 of total consolidated assets of us and our subsidiaries. To the best of our knowledge, as of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance in all material respects with all covenants contained in our Revolving Credit Agreement. 
 2027 Senior Notes 
 On November 3, 2021, we issued 100.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Senior Notes. The 2027 Senior Notes accrue interest at a rate of 5.75 per annum. Interest on the 2027 Senior Notes is due semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year, which began on May 1, 2022. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2027 Senior Notes were approximately 97.0 million, after deducting the initial purchasers discounts and commissions and estimated offering fees and expenses payable by us. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2027 Senior Notes (i) to fund loans related to unfunded commitments to existing borrowers, (ii) to originate and participate in commercial loans to companies operating in the cannabis industry that are consistent with our investment strategy and (iii) for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The terms of the 2027 Senior Notes are governed by the Indenture. Under the Indenture governing the 2027 Senior Notes, we are required to cause all of our existing and future subsidiaries to guarantee the 2027 Senior Notes, other than certain immaterial subsidiaries as set forth in the Indenture. TRS1 is currently a subsidiary guarantor under the Indenture. 
 Prior to February 1, 2027, we may redeem the 2027 Senior Notes in whole or in part, at a price equal to the greater of 100 of the principal amount of the 2027 Senior Notes being redeemed or a make-whole premium set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date. On or after February 1, 2027, we may redeem the 2027 Senior Notes in whole or in part at a price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the 2027 Senior Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date. The Indenture also requires us to offer to purchase all of the 2027 Senior Notes at a purchase price equal to 101 of the principal amount of the 2027 Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest if a change of control triggering event (as defined in the Indenture) occurs.

 The Indenture governing the 2027 Senior Notes contains customary terms and restrictions, subject to a number of exceptions and qualifications, including restrictions on our ability to (1) incur additional indebtedness unless the Annual Debt Service Charge (as defined in the Indenture) is no less than 1.5 to 1.0, (2) incur or maintain total debt in an aggregate principal amount greater than 60 of our consolidated Total Assets (as defined in the Indenture), (3) incur or maintain secured debt in an aggregate principal amount greater than 25 of our consolidated Total Assets (as defined in the Indenture); and (4) merge, consolidate or sell substantially all of our assets. In addition, the Indenture also provides for customary events of default. If any event of default occurs, any amount then outstanding under the Indenture may immediately become due and payable. These events of default are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications set forth in the Indenture. We were in compliance with the terms of the Indenture as of the date of this quarterly report. 
 The table below sets forth the material terms of our outstanding senior notes as of the date of this Quarterly Report: 
 Senior Notes Issue Date Amount Outstanding Interest Rate Coupon Maturity Date Interest Due Dates Optional Redemption Date 2027 Senior Notes November 3, 2021 90.0 million 5.75 May 1, 2027 May 1 and November 1 February 1, 2027 
 Other Credit Facilities, Warehouse Facilities and Repurchase Agreements 
 In the future, we may also use other sources of financing to fund the origination or acquisition of our target investments, including other credit facilities and other secured and unsecured forms of borrowing. These financings may be collateralized or non-collateralized and may involve one or more lenders. We expect that these facilities will typically have maturities ranging from two to five years and may accrue interest at either fixed or floating rates. 
 Debt Service 
 As of September 30, 2024 , we believe that our cash on hand, capacity available under our Revolving Credit Facility, and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to service our outstanding debt during the next twelve months. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 Cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities of continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows: 
 September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities of continuing operations 16,064,202 14,982,587 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities of continuing operations 99,298,100 18,508,853 Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities of continuing operations (70,885,129) (100,667,506) 
 Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities of Continuing Operations 
 Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 16.1 million, compared to approximately 15.0 million for the same period in 2023. The increase of approximately 1.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in the change in unrealized (gains) losses on loans held at fair value of approximately 8.5 million, decrease in PIK interest of approximately 6.6 million, decrease in gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt of approximately 2.0 million, increase in interest reserve of approximately 4.1 million, increase in interest receivable of approximately 1.6 million, partially offset by a decrease in net income from continuing operations of approximately (15.3) million, decrease in accrued management and incentive fees of approximately (2.2) million, increase in provision for current expected credit losses of approximately (1.3) million and increase in OID accretion of approximately (2.7) million, respectively.

Index 

 Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities of Continuing Operations 
 Net cash provided by investing activities of continuing operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 99.3 million, compared to approximately 18.5 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in net cash provided by investing activities of approximately 80.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024 was primarily due to an decrease in issuance and fundings on loans of approximately 1.7 million, an increase in proceeds from the sale of loans of approximately 74.7 million and an increase in principal repayments of loans of approximately 3.3 million, respectively. 
 Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities of Continuing Operations 
 Net cash used in financing activities of continuing operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately (70.9) million, compared to approximately (100.7) million for the same period in 2023. The decrease of approximately 29.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility of 164.0 million, offset by an increase in repayments on the Revolving Credit Facility of (86.0) million, an increase in proceeds from the ATM program of 12.3 million, a decrease in repayments of the 2027 Senior Notes of approximately 7.7 million, and an increase in cash distributions in connection with the Spin-Off of SUNS of approximately (67.9) million, respectively. 
 
 Cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities of discontinued operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows: 
 September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities of discontinued operations 3,271,445 7,767 Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities of discontinued operations (47,211,339) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities of discontinued operations 
 Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities of Discontinued Operations 
 Net cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 3.3 million, compared to approximately 7.8 thousand for the same period in 2023. The increase of approximately 3.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in net income from discontinued operations of 2.9 million and changes in working capital of 0.3 million, respectively. 
 Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities of Discontinued Operations 
 Net cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately (47.2) million, compared to net cash provided by investing activities of zero for the same period in 2023. The decrease of net cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations was primarily due to the issuance and fundings on loans of approximately 67.3 million, offset by principal repayments of loans of 15.1 million, respectively. 
 Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities of Discontinued Operations 
 There were no cash flows related to financing activities of discontinued operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Contractual Obligations, Other Commitments, and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024 are as follows: 
 As of September 30, 2024 Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Total Unfunded commitments 13,739,804 5,791,532 610,437 20,141,773 Total 13,739,804 5,791,532 610,437 20,141,773

Index 

 As of September 30, 2024 , all unfunded commitments were related to our total loan commitments and were available for funding in less than four years. 
 We also had the following contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024 relating to the 2027 Senior Notes: 
 As of September 30, 2024 Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Total Contractual obligations (1) 
 5,175,000 100,350,000 105,525,000 Total 5,175,000 100,350,000 105,525,000 
 (1) Amounts include projected interest payments during the period based on interest rates in effect as of September 30, 2024 . 
 We may enter into certain contracts that may contain a variety of indemnification obligations. The maximum potential future payment amounts we could be required to pay under these indemnification obligations may be unlimited. 
 Off-balance sheet commitments consist of unfunded commitments on delayed draw loans. Other than as set forth in this Quarterly Report, we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured investment vehicles, special purpose entities or variable interest entities, established to facilitate off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities or entered into any commitment or intend to provide additional funding to any such entities. 
 
 Leverage Policies 
 We currently do not intend to have leverage of more than one times equity. While we are required to maintain our leverage ratio in compliance with the 2027 Senior Notes Indenture, we expect to employ prudent amounts of leverage and, when appropriate, to use debt as a means of providing additional funds for the acquisition of loans, to refinance existing debt or for general corporate purposes. Leverage is primarily used to provide capital for forward commitments until additional equity is raised or additional medium- to long-term financing is arranged. This policy is subject to change by management and our Board. 
 
 Dividends 
 We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for United States federal income tax purposes and, as such, intend to annually distribute to our shareholders at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, prior to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding our net capital gain. If we distribute less than 100 of our REIT taxable income in any tax year (taking into account any distributions made in a subsequent tax year under Sections 857(b)(9) or 858 of the Code), we will pay tax at regular corporate rates on that undistributed portion. Furthermore, if we distribute less than the sum of (i) 85 of our ordinary income for the calendar year, (ii) 95 of our capital gain net income for the calendar year and (iii) any undistributed shortfall from our prior calendar year (the Required Distribution to our shareholders during any calendar year (including any distributions declared by the last day of the calendar year but paid in the subsequent year), then we are required to pay non-deductible excise tax equal to 4 of any shortfall between the Required Distribution and the amount that was actually distributed. Any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distribution to our shareholders. The 90 distribution requirement does not require the distribution of net capital gains. However, if we elect to retain any of our net capital gain for any tax year, we must notify our shareholders and pay tax at regular corporate rates on the retained net capital gain. The shareholders must include their proportionate share of the retained net capital gain in their taxable income for the tax year, and they are deemed to have paid the REIT s tax on their proportionate share of the retained capital gain. Furthermore, such retained capital gain may be subject to the nondeductible 4 excise tax. If we determine that our estimated current year taxable income (including net capital gain) will be in excess of estimated dividend distributions (including capital gains dividends) for the current year from such income, we will accrue excise tax on a portion of the estimated excess taxable income as such taxable income is earned. 
 To the extent that our cash available for distribution is less than the amount required to be distributed under the REIT provisions of the Code, we may be required to fund distributions from working capital or through equity, equity-related or debt financings or, in certain circumstances, asset sales, as to which our ability to consummate transactions in a timely manner on favorable terms, or at all, cannot be assured, or we may make a portion of the Required Distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 As of September 30, 2024 , there were no significant changes in or changes in the application of our critical accounting policies or estimates from those presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Risk Management 
 To the extent consistent with maintaining our REIT qualification and our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act, we seek to manage risk exposure by closely monitoring our portfolio and actively managing financing, interest rate, credit, prepayment and convexity (a measure of the sensitivity of the duration of a loan to changes in interest rates) risks associated with holding our portfolio. Generally, with the guidance and experience of our Manager: 
 we manage our portfolio through an interactive process with our Manager and service our self-originated loans through our Manager s servicer; 
 we invest in a mix of floating- and fixed-rate loans to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with the financing of our portfolio; 
 we actively employ portfolio-wide and asset-specific risk measurement and management processes in our daily operations, including utilizing our Manager s risk management tools such as software and services licensed or purchased from third-parties and proprietary analytical methods developed by our Manager; and 
 we seek to manage credit risk through our due diligence process prior to origination or acquisition and through the use of non-recourse financing, when and where available and appropriate. In addition, with respect to any particular target investment, prior to origination or acquisition our Manager s investment team evaluates, among other things, relative valuation, comparable company analysis, supply and demand trends, shape-of-yield curves, delinquency and default rates, recovery of various sectors and vintage of collateral. 
 Changes in Fair Value of Our Assets 
 We generally hold our target investments as long-term loans; however, we may occasionally classify some of our loans as held for sale. We may carry our loans at fair value or carrying value in our consolidated balance sheet. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, one and two of our loans held for investment were carried at fair value within loans held at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets, respectively, with changes in fair value recorded through earnings. 
 We evaluate our loans on a quarterly basis and fair value is determined by our Board through its independent Audit and Valuation Committee. We use an independent third-party valuation firm to provide input in the valuation of all of our unquoted investments, which we consider along with other various subjective and objective factors in making our evaluations. 
 Our loans are typically valued using a yield analysis, which is typically performed for non-credit impaired loans to borrowers. Alternative valuation methodologies may be used as appropriate, and can include a market analysis, income analysis, or recovery analysis. To determine fair value using a yield analysis, a current price is imputed for the loan based upon an assessment of the expected market yield for a similarly structured loan with a similar level of risk. In the yield analysis, we consider the current contractual interest rate, the maturity and other terms of the loan relative to risk of the borrower and the specific loan. A key determinant of risk, among other things, is the leverage through the loan relative to the enterprise value of the borrower. As loans held by us are substantially illiquid with no active transaction market, we depend on primary market data, including newly funded loans, as well as secondary market data with respect to high-yield debt instruments and syndicated loans, as inputs in determining the appropriate market yield, as applicable. Changes in market yields, recovery rates, and revenue multiples may change the fair value of certain of our loans. Generally, an increase in market yields may result in a decrease in the fair value of certain of our loans, while a decrease in revenue multiples and recovery rates may result in a decrease in the fair value of certain of our loans ; however, this is mitigated to the extent our loans bear interest at a floating rate. 
 52 

Index 

 Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of loans that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our loans may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of our loans may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such loans and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. Further, such loans are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If we were required to liquidate our investment in a loan in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we had recorded such loan investment. 
 Changes in Market Interest Rates and Effect on Net Interest Income 
 Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including fiscal and monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political considerations, as well as other factors beyond our control. We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our assets and our related financing obligations. 
 Our operating results depend in large part on differences between the income earned on our assets and our cost of borrowing. The cost of our borrowings generally will be based on prevailing market interest rates. During a period of rising interest rates, our borrowing costs generally will increase (a) while the yields earned on our leveraged fixed-rate loan assets will remain static, and (b) at a faster pace than the yields earned on our leveraged floating-rate loan assets, which could result in a decline in our net interest spread and net interest margin. The severity of any such decline would depend on our asset/liability composition at the time as well as the magnitude and duration of the interest rate increase. Further, an increase in short-term interest rates could also have a negative impact on the market value of our target investments. If any of these events happen, we could experience a decrease in net income or incur a net loss during these periods, which could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. 
 We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily relate to fluctuations in interest rates. Our loans are typically valued using a yield analysis, which is typically performed for non-credit impaired loans to borrowers. Alternative valuation methodologies may be used as appropriate, and can include a market analysis, income analysis, or recovery analysis. Changes in market yields, revenue multiples, and recovery rates may change the fair value of certain of our loans. Generally, an increase in market yields may result in a decrease in the fair value of certain of our loans, while a decrease in revenue multiples and recovery rates may result in a decrease in the fair value of certain of our loans; however, this is mitigated to the extent our loans bear interest at a floating rate. As of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 50 bps or increase of 50 bps of the market yield would have resulted in a change in unrealized gain (loss) of approximately 0.3 million and (0.3) million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had seven floating-rate loans, representing approximately 38 of our portfolio based on aggregate outstanding principal balances. These floating benchmark rates included one-month SOFR subject to a weighted average floor of 3.6 and quoted at 4.8 . We estimate that a hypothetical 100 basis points increase in the floating benchmark rate would result in an increase in annual interest income of approximately 1.1 million and a hypothetical 100 basis points decrease in the floating benchmark rate would result in a decrease in annual interest income of approximately (0.4) million. 
 Interest Rate Cap Risk 
 Through our Manager, we originate both fixed and floating rate loans. These are assets in which the loans may be subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate caps and floors, which limit the amount by which the asset s interest yield may change during any given period. However, our borrowing costs pursuant to our financing agreements may not be subject to similar restrictions. Therefore, in a period of increasing interest rates, interest rate costs on our borrowings could increase without limitation by caps, while the interest-rate yields on our floating-rate assets would effectively be limited. In addition, floating-rate assets may be subject to periodic payment caps that result in some portion of the interest being deferred and added to the principal outstanding. This could result in our receipt of cash income from such assets in an amount that is less than the amount that we would need to pay the interest cost on our related borrowings. These factors could lower our net interest income or cause a net loss during periods of rising interest rates, which would harm our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. 
 Interest Rate Mismatch Risk 
 We may fund a portion of our origination of loans, or of loans that we may in the future acquire, with borrowings that are based on various benchmarks, while the interest rates on these assets may be fixed or indexed to SOFR, or another index rate. Accordingly, any increase in an index rate will generally result in an increase in our borrowing costs that would not be matched by fixed-rate interest earnings and may not be matched by a corresponding increase in floating-rate interest earnings. Any such interest rate mismatch could adversely affect our profitability, which may negatively impact distributions to our shareholders. 
 53 

Index 

 Our analysis of risks is based on our Manager s experience, estimates, models and assumptions. These analyses rely on models which utilize estimates of fair value and interest rate sensitivity. Actual economic conditions or implementation of decisions by our Manager and our management may produce results that differ significantly from the estimates and assumptions used in our models and the projected results. 
 Credit Risk 
 We are subject to varying degrees of credit risk in connection with our loans and interest receivable. Our Manager seeks to mitigate this risk by seeking to originate loans, and may in the future acquire loans, of higher quality at appropriate prices given anticipated and unanticipated losses, by employing a comprehensive review and selection process and by proactively monitoring originated and acquired loans. Nevertheless, unanticipated credit losses could occur that could adversely impact our operating results. 
 We expect to be subject to varying degrees of credit risk in connection with holding our portfolio of loans. We will have exposure to credit risk on our commercial real estate loans and other targeted types of loans. Our Manager will seek to manage credit risk by performing deep credit fundamental analysis of potential assets and through the use of non-recourse financing, when and where available and appropriate. 
 Credit risk will also be addressed through our Manager s ongoing review, and loans will be monitored for variance from expected prepayments, defaults, severities, losses and cash flow on a quarterly basis. 
 Other than the acquisition of our initial portfolio of loans and certain loan commitments relating to Private Company A, we, through our Manager, have originated substantially all of our loans and intend to continue to originate our loans, but we have previously and may in the future acquire loans from time to time. Our Investment Guidelines are not subject to any limits or proportions with respect to the mix of target investments that we make or that we may in the future acquire other than as necessary to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act and our qualification as a REIT. Our investment decisions will depend on prevailing market conditions and may change over time in response to opportunities available in different interest rate, economic and credit environments. As a result, we cannot predict the percentage of our capital that will be invested in any individual target investment at any given time. 
 Our loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024 was concentrated with the top three borrowers representing approximately 56.5 of the aggregate outstanding principal balances and approximately 57.5 of the total loan commitments. Additionally, the industry is experiencing significant consolidation, which we expect to increase, among cannabis operations and certain of our borrowers may combine, increasing the concentration of our borrower portfolio with those consolidated operators. Our largest credit facility represented approximately 26.5 of the aggregate outstanding principal balances of our portfolio and approximately 21.0 of our total loan commitments as of September 30, 2024. The borrower under this credit facility is a Subsidiary of Private Company G, a multi-state operator with real estate assets in several states, certain of which have been included as collateral in connection with the senior term loan. Our portion of the senior term loan provided to such borrower has a principal amount of 79.2 million outstanding as of September 30, 2024, which is fully funded. This senior term loan accrues interest at a fixed rate of 12.5 , a minimum portion of which is payable in cash pursuant to the excess cash flow sweep, and the remainder of which, if any, is paid in kind. 
 We primarily provide loans to companies operating in the cannabis industry which involves significant risks, including the risk of strict enforcement against our borrowers of the federal illegality of cannabis, our borrowers inability to renew or otherwise maintain their licenses or other requisite authorizations for their cannabis operations, and such loans lack of liquidity, and we could lose all or part of any of our loans. 
 Our ability to grow or maintain our core business depends on state laws pertaining to the cannabis industry. New laws that are adverse to our borrowers may be enacted, and current favorable state or national laws or enforcement guidelines relating to cultivation, production and distribution of cannabis may be modified or eliminated in the future, which would impede our ability to grow and could materially adversely affect our business. 
 Management s plan to mitigate risks include monitoring the legal landscape as deemed appropriate. Also, should a loan default or otherwise be seized, we may be prohibited from owning cannabis assets and thus could not take possession of collateral, in which case we would look to sell the loan, which could result in us realizing a loss on the transaction.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q was made under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ). Based upon this evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (a) are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC rules and forms and (b) include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a 15(f) and 15d 15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we may become involved in litigation or other legal proceedings relating to claims arising from the ordinary course of business. Furthermore, third parties may try to seek to impose liability on us in connection with our loans. As of September 30, 2024 , we were not subject to any material legal proceedings. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Except as disclosed below, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 , there were no material changes to the Risk Factors disclosed in Item 1A - Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Maintenance of our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act may impose significant limits on our operations. Your investment return in our common stock may be reduced if we are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. 
 We intend to conduct our operations so that (i) we will be exempt from the provisions of the Investment Company Act pursuant to an exemption contained in Section 3(c)(5)(C) thereunder and (ii) any wholly owned or majority owned subsidiary does not come within the definition of an investment company or will be exempt from the provisions of the Investment Company Act pursuant to an exemption contained in Section 3(c)(1), 3(c)(5) or 3(c)(7) thereunder. The Investment Company Act provides certain protection to investors and imposes certain restrictions on registered investment companies (including, for example, limitations on the ability of registered investment companies to incur leverage), none of which will be applicable to us.

Index 

 The exemption contained in Section 3(c)(5)(C) is available for entities primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate. On the basis of no-action letters and interpretive guidance provided by the SEC and its staff, this exemption generally requires that at least 55 of an entity s assets be comprised of qualifying assets and at least 80 of such entity s assets be comprised of qualifying assets and real estate-related assets (and no more than 20 of such entity s assets may be comprised of non-qualifying or non-real estate-related assets). Qualifying assets for this purpose include, for example, certain mortgage loans, certain B-Notes and certain mezzanine loans that satisfy various conditions as interpreted by the SEC staff in various no-action letters and other SEC interpretive guidance. Investments that do not satisfy the qualifying asset conditions set forth in the relevant SEC staff no-action letters and other guidance, may be classified as real estate-related or non-real estate-related assets, depending upon applicable SEC guidance, if any. Pursuant to this guidance, and depending on the characteristics of the specific investments, certain mortgage loans, participations in mortgage loans, mortgage-backed securities, and mezzanine loans may not constitute qualifying assets and therefore our investments in these types of assets may be limited. 
 We classify our assets for purposes of our Section 3(c)(5)(C) exemption based upon no-action positions taken by the SEC staff and interpretive guidance provided by the SEC and its staff. These no-action positions are based on specific factual situations that may be substantially or entirely different from the factual situations we may face and a number of these no-action positions were issued more than twenty years ago. There may be no guidance from the SEC or its staff that applies directly to our factual situations and as a result we may have to apply SEC staff guidance that relates to other factual situations by analogy. No assurance can be given that the SEC or its staff will concur with our classification of our assets. In addition, the SEC or its staff may, in the future, issue further guidance that may require us to re-classify our assets for purposes of the Investment Company Act and/or adjust our strategy accordingly. If we are required to reclassify our assets, we may no longer be in compliance with the exemption from the definition of an investment company provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act. Any additional guidance from the SEC or its staff could further inhibit our ability to pursue our chosen strategies.
