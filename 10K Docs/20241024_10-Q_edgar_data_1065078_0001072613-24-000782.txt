SPECIAL
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

 This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions
that, if they never materialize or prove incorrect, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such
forward-looking statements. The statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not purely historical are forward-looking
statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended. Such forward-looking statements include any expectation of earnings, revenue or other financial items; any statements
of the plans, strategies and objectives of management for future operations; factors that may affect our operating results; statements
related to future performance and other matters that do not relate strictly to historical facts or statements of assumptions underlying
any of the foregoing. Forward-looking statements are often identified by the use of words such as, but not limited to, anticipate, 
 believe, can, continue, could, estimate, expect, 
 intend, may, will, plan, project, seek, should, 
 target, would, and similar expressions or variations intended to identify forward-looking statements. These
statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management based on information currently available to management. Such forward-looking
statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results and the timing of certain
events to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Except as required by law, we
undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements.
Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include various risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (filed with the SEC on
March 8, 2024). Furthermore, such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report. Such risks and uncertainties include,
but are not limited to, the following: 

our
 uncertain revenue from licensing our intellectual property; 

uncertainty
 of the outcome of our pending litigations; 

our
 ability to achieve future revenue from our patent portfolios; 

our
 ability to protect our patents; 

our
 ability to execute our strategy to acquire or make investments in high quality patents with
 significant licensing opportunities; 

our
 ability to enter into strategic relationships with third parties to license or otherwise
 monetize their intellectual property; 

our
 ability to achieve a return on our investment in ILiAD Biotechnologies, LLC; 

our
 ability to continue to acquire additional intellectual property; 

uncertainty
 as to whether cash dividends will continue to be paid; 

variations
 in our quarterly and annual operating results; 

the
 increasing development of artificial intelligence could materially impact our business; 

the
 risk that we may be determined to be a personal holding company in 2024 or future years which
 may result in our issuing a special cash dividend to our stockholders to the extent we have
 undistributed personal holding company income resulting in less cash available for our operations
 and strategic transactions; and 

legislative,
 regulatory and competitive developments.

 Notes
to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements U.S. patents, fifty-four of such patents have expired, and sixteen foreign patents related to (i) the Cox patent
portfolio (the Cox Patent Portfolio) relating to enabling technology for identifying media content on the Internet and taking
further actions to be performed after such identification; (ii) the M2M/IoT patent portfolio (the M2M/IoT Patent Portfolio relating to, among other things, enabling technology for authenticating and using eSIM (embedded Subscriber Identification Module) technology
in Internet of Things IoT ), Machine-to-Machine, and other mobile devices, including smartphones, tablets and computers,
as well as automobiles; (iii) the HFT patent portfolio (the HFT Patent Portfolio covering certain advanced technologies
relating to high frequency trading, which inventions specifically address technological problems associated with speed and latency and
provide critical latency gains in trading systems where the difference between success and failure may be measured in nanoseconds; (iv)
the Mirror Worlds patent portfolio (the Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio relating to foundational technologies that enable
unified search and indexing, displaying and archiving of documents in a computer system; and (v) the remote power patent (the Remote
Power Patent covering delivery of Power over Ethernet (PoE) cables for the purpose of remotely powering network devices, such
as wireless access ports, IP phones and network based cameras. 

The
Company s current strategy includes continuing to pursue licensing opportunities for its patent portfolios. In addition, the Company
reviews opportunities to acquire or license additional intellectual property as well as other strategic alternatives. The Company s
patent acquisition and development strategy is to focus on acquiring high quality patents which management believes have the potential
to generate significant licensing opportunities as the Company has achieved with respect to its Remote Power Patent and Mirror Worlds
Patent Portfolio. In addition, the Company may also enter into strategic relationships with third parties to develop, commercialize,
license or otherwise monetize their intellectual property. 

 The
Company has also made equity investments totaling in ILiAD Biotechnologies, LLC ILiAD ), a clinical stage biotechnology
company (see Note J hereof). 

Revenue
disaggregated by source is as follows: 

Total Revenue 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had revenue. 

 Revenue
from the Company s patent licensing and enforcement business is typically generated from negotiated license agreements or settlement
agreements with respect to any of the Company s patents. The timing and amount of revenue recognized from each licensee or such
settlement agreement depends upon a variety of factors, including the terms of each agreement and the nature of the obligations of the
parties. These agreements may include, but not be limited to, elements related to past infringement liabilities, non-refundable upfront
license fees, and ongoing royalties on licensed products sold by the licensee. Generally, in the event of a litigation settlement related
to the Company s assertion of patent infringement involving its intellectual property, defendants may either pay (i) a non-refundable
lump sum payment for a non-exclusive fully-paid license, (ii) a non-refundable lump sum payment (license initiation fee) together with
an ongoing obligation to pay quarterly or monthly royalties to the Company for the life of the licensed patent, or (iii) a lump sum settlement
payment with respect to litigation involving the Company s expired patents. 

 Fully-paid
licenses provide for a non-refundable up-front payment for which the Company has no future obligations or performance requirements, revenue
is generally recognized when the Company has obtained the signed license agreement, all performance obligations have been substantially
performed, amounts are fixed and determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue from fully-paid licenses may consist
of one or more installments. The timing and amount of revenue recognized from each licensee depends upon a number of factors including
the specific terms of each agreement and the nature of the deliverables and obligations. 

temporary
(timing) differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between financial statement carrying
amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Under this accounting
standard, the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment
date. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be
realized. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had total deferred tax assets generated from its activities of . The Company s
deferred tax assets were offset by a valuation allowance of as it was determined that it is more likely than not that certain
deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of September 30, 2024, the Company also had a deferred tax liability of . 

 The
personal holding company PHC rules under the Internal Revenue Code impose a 20 tax on a PHC s undistributed personal
holding company income UPHCI ), which means, in general, taxable income subject to certain adjustments and reduced by certain
distributions to shareholders. For a corporation to be classified as a PHC, it must satisfy two tests: (i) that more than 50 in value
of its outstanding shares must be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals at any time during the second half of the
year (after applying constructive ownership rules to attribute stock owned by entities to their beneficial owners and among certain family
members and other related parties) (the Ownership Test and (ii) at least 60 of its adjusted ordinary gross income for
a taxable year consists of dividends, interest, royalties, annuities and rents (the Income Test ). At September 30, 2024,
based on available information concerning the Company s shareholder ownership, the Company did not satisfy the Ownership Test.
However, during the second half of 2024 the Company may subsequently be determined to be a PHC in 2024 or in future years if it satisfies
both the Ownership Test and Income Test. If the Company were to become a PHC in 2024 or any future year, it would be subject to the 20 
tax on its UPHCI. In such event, the Company may issue a special cash dividend to its shareholders in an amount equal to the UPHCI rather
than incur the 20 tax. 

 ASC
740-10, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes , defines uncertainty in income taxes and the evaluation of a tax position as
a two-step process. The first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination,
including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation based on the technical merits of that position. The second step is to measure
a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not threshold to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements.
A tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate
settlement. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first
subsequent period in which the threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not criteria
should be de-recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which the threshold is no longer met. The Company had no
uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2024. 

 The
Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to income tax in the income tax provision in the unaudited condensed consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 

 U.S.
federal, state and local income tax returns prior to 2020 are not subject to examination by any applicable tax authorities, except that
tax authorities could challenge returns (only under certain circumstances) for earlier years to the extent they generated loss carry-forwards

awards under the 2013 Plan.

loss. 

 The
Company had an aggregate of of unrecognized restricted stock unit compensation as of September 30, 2024 to be expensed over
a weighted average period of years. 

 All
of the Company s outstanding (unvested) restricted stock units have dividend equivalent rights. During the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2024, the Company paid a total of and , respectively, of such dividend equivalent rights. As of September
30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was and , respectively, accrued for dividend equivalent rights which were
included in other accrued expenses.

the Company generated a net loss in 2024 and 2023, all potentially dilutive shares were not reflected in diluted net loss per share because
the impact of such instruments was anti-dilutive.

Patent Acquisitions 

 On
March 25, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of a new patent portfolio (HFT Patent Portfolio) currently consisting of nine U.S.
patents and two pending U.S. patents covering certain advanced technologies relating to high frequency trading, which inventions specifically
address technological problems associated with speed and latency and provide critical latency gains in trading systems where the difference
between success and failure may be measured in nanoseconds. The Company paid the seller at the closing and has an obligation
to pay the seller an additional in cash and of the Company s common stock (up to a maximum of shares)
upon achieving certain milestones with respect to the patent portfolio. The Company also has an additional obligation to pay the seller
 of the first 50 million of net proceeds (after deduction of expenses) generated by the patent portfolio and of net proceeds
greater than 50 million. Obligation to pay Recognition, net proceeds No such payments were made or accrued by the Company during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

 In
connection with the Company s acquisition of its Cox Patent Portfolio, the Company is obligated to pay Dr. Cox of the
net proceeds (after deduction of expenses) generated by the Company from licensing, sale or enforcement of the patent portfolio. No such
payments were made or accrued by the Company during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

 As

ITEM
2: MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

 OVERVIEW 

 Our
principal business is the development, licensing and protection of our intellectual property assets. We presently own one-hundred four
(104) U.S. patents and sixteen (16) foreign patents relating to:(i) our Cox Patent Portfolio relating to enabling technology for identifying
media content on the Internet and taking further action to be performed after such identification; (ii) our M2M/IoT Patent Portfolio
relating to, among other things, enabling technology for authenticating and using eSim (embedded Subscriber Identification Module) technology
in IoT, Machine-to-Machine and other mobile devices, including smartphones, tablets and computers as well as automobiles; (iii) our HFT
Patent Portfolio covering certain advanced technologies relating to high frequency trading, which inventions specifically address technological
problems associated with speed and latency and provide critical latency gains in trading systems where the difference between success
and failure may be measured in nanoseconds; (iv) our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio relating to foundational technologies that enable
unified search and indexing, displaying and archiving of documents in a computer system; and (v) our Remote Power Patent covering the
delivery of power over Ethernet (PoE) cables for the purpose of remotely powering network devices, such as wireless access ports, IP
phones and network based cameras. 

 With
respect to our one-hundred four (104) U.S. patents, fifty-four (54) of such patents have expired. However, we can assert expired patents
against third parties but only for past damages up to the patent expiration date. We currently have pending litigation involving expired
patents including our Remote Power Patent and certain patents within our Cox and Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolios (see Note I to our unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements included herein). Our revenue is largely dependent upon our ability to achieve successful
litigation outcomes. 

 At
September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of 41,516,000
and working capital of 41,058,000. Based on our cash position, we review opportunities to acquire additional intellectual property as
well as evaluate other strategic opportunities. 

 To
date we have invested 7,000,000 in ILiAD, a clinical stage biotechnology company with an exclusive license to seventy-two (72) patents
(see Note J to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein). Our investment continues to involve significant
risk and the outcome is uncertain. 

 We
have been dependent upon our Remote Power Patent for a significant portion of our revenue. Our Remote Power Patent has generated
licensing revenue in excess of 188,000,000 from May 2007 through September 30, 2024. We no longer receive licensing revenue for our
Remote Power Patent for any period subsequent to March 7, 2020 (the expiration date of the patent). During the fourth quarter of
2022, we commenced nine separate litigations against ten defendants involving our Remote Power Patent for patent infringement for
the period prior to March 7, 2020. As of September 30, 2024, we entered into settlements with nine defendants with respect to the
aforementioned litigation, including one defendant for 100,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulting in aggregate
settlement payments made to us of 2,701,000 and a future conditional payment of 150,000 (see Note I[3] hereof). All of our revenue
for 2023 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was from these settlements involving our Remote Power Patent. If we are
unable to successfully monetize our other patent portfolios or achieve a successful outcome of our investment in ILiAD, our
business, financial condition and results of operations will be negatively impacted. 

23 

In
addition, we have appealed the judgment of the District Court dismissing our litigation against Google and YouTube involving certain
patents within our Cox Patent Portfolio and have also appealed the judgment of the District Court dismissing our litigation against Meta
(Facebook) on the grounds of non-infringement involving certain patents within our Mirror Worlds Portfolio. We also intend to commence
efforts to monetize certain patents within our HFT and M2M/IoT patent portfolios. We may not achieve successful outcomes of such appeals
or litigation involving our patent assets. 

 Our
current strategy includes continuing our licensing efforts with respect to our intellectual property assets and the monetization of our
patent portfolios. In addition, we continue to seek to acquire additional intellectual property assets to develop, commercialize, license
or otherwise monetize. Our strategy includes working with inventors and patent owners to assist in the development and monetization of
their patented technologies. We may also enter into strategic relationships with third parties to develop, commercialize, license or
otherwise monetize their intellectual property. Our patent acquisition and development strategy is to focus on acquiring high quality
patents which management believes have the potential to generate significant licensing opportunities as we have achieved with respect
to our Remote Power Patent and Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio. 

 The
significant components of expenses, when revenue is recorded, that may impact our net income (loss) relate to contingent legal fees and
expenses related to our patent litigation (see Note G[1] to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein)
and incentive compensation payable to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer pursuant to his employment agreement (see Note H to our
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein). Both such components of expenses are based on a percentage of
the revenue received by us as a result of litigation or otherwise. 

 Our
annual and quarterly operating and financial results may fluctuate significantly from period to period as a result of a variety of factors
that are outside our control, including the timing and our ability to achieve successful outcomes of our patent litigation, our ability
and timing of consummating future license agreements for our intellectual property, and whether we will achieve a return on our investment
in ILiAD and the timing of any such return. 

 Our
future operating results may also be materially impacted by our ability to acquire high quality patents which management believes have
the potential to generate significant licensing opportunities. In the future, we may not be able to identify or consummate such patent
acquisitions or, if consummated, achieve significant licensing revenue with respect to such acquisitions. 

 In
2024 and future years we could be classified as a Personal Holding Company. If this is the case, we would be subject to a 20 tax on
the amount of any undistributed personal holding company income (as defined) for such year that we do not distribute to our shareholders
(see Note B[4] to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report).

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS 

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

 Revenue .
We had no revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 as we had no litigation outcomes during such periods. 

 Operating
Expenses . Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 896,000 as compared to 859,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. The increase in operating expenses of 37,000 was primarily as a result of increased professional fees of 181,000
offset by decreases in general and administrative expenses of 85,000, amortization of patents of 41,000 and stock-based compensation
of 18,000. 

 General
and administrative expenses were 473,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 558,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in general and administrative expenses of 85,000 was primarily due to decreased state franchise
and capital-based taxes of 100,000. 

 Interest
and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 524,000 as compared to 406,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of higher yielding fixed income investments with longer maturities. 

 Realized
and Unrealized Gain on Marketable Securities. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded realized and unrealized
gains on marketable securities of 293,000, as compared to 131,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 largely due to the
timing of the maturities of fixed income investments and a relatively stable interest rate environment. 

 Income
Taxes . For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had no current tax expense for federal, state and local income taxes and
a deferred tax benefit of 71,000. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had a current tax benefit of 13,000 for federal,
state and local income taxes and a deferred tax benefit of 31,000. 

 Share
of Net Losses of Equity Method Investee . We recognized 308,000 of net losses during the three month period ended September 30, 2024
related to our equity share of ILiAD net losses, as compared to a recognized net loss of 532,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2023. We expect to continue to record our share of net losses from ILiAD as ILiAD is a privately held clinical stage biotechnology
company. 

 Net
Loss . As a result of the foregoing, we realized a net loss of 316,000 or 0.01 per share basic and diluted for the three months
ended September 30, 2024, compared with a net loss of 810,000 or 0.03 per share basic and diluted for the three months ended September
30, 2023. Our decreased net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to increases in interest income of 118,000
and in realized and unrealized gains from investments of 162,000, along with a decrease in our equity share of ILiAD net losses of 224,000. 

25 

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

 Revenue .
We had revenue of 100,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to revenue of 820,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. All such revenue was from litigation settlements involving our Remote Power Patent (see Note I[3] and B[2] to our unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements included herein). 

 Operating
Expenses . Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 2,538,000 as compared to 3,004,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in operating expenses of 466,000 was primarily as a result of decreases in costs of revenue
of 204,000 related to litigation settlements, amortization of patents of 146,000 and general and administrative expenses of 306,000,
offset by increased professional fees of 190,000. 

 General
and administrative expenses were 1,764,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2,070,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in general and administrative expenses of 306,000 was primarily due to decreases in payroll and
payroll taxes of 188,000, exchange listing fees of 43,000, stock-based compensation of 75,000 and the timing of recording certain
state franchise and capital-based taxes of 37,000. 

 Interest
and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1,407,000 as compared to 1,161,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest and dividend income of 246,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 was primarily due to higher yielding fixed income investments with long maturities. 

 Realized
and Unrealized Gain on Marketable Securities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded realized and unrealized gains
on marketable securities of 395,000 as compared to gains of 420,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 largely due to a relatively
stable interest rate environment. 

 Income
Taxes . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had no current tax expense for federal, state and local income taxes and
a deferred tax benefit of 355,000 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had a current tax benefit of 13,000 for
federal, state and local income taxes and a deferred tax benefit of 278,000. 

 Share
of Net Losses of Equity Method Investee . We recognized 1,613,000 of net losses during the nine month period ended September 30,
2024 related to our equity share of ILiAD net losses, as compared to a recognized net loss of 1,597,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. We expect to continue to record our share of net losses from ILiAD as ILiAD is a privately held clinical stage biotechnology
company. 

 Net
Loss . As a result of the foregoing, we realized a net loss of 1,894,000 or 0.08 per share basic and diluted for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, compared with a net loss of 1,909,000 or 0.08 per share basic and diluted for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. 

26 

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

We
have financed our operations primarily from revenue from licensing our patents. At September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity
consisted of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of 41,516,000 and working capital of 41,058,000. Based on our current
cash position, we believe that we will have sufficient cash to fund our operations for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future.
Our patent infringement litigation or realization of our investment in ILiAD may result in a material increase in our liquidity and capital
resources. 

 Working
capital decreased by 3,792,000 at September 30, 2024 to 41,058,000 as compared to working capital of 44,850,000 at December 31,
2023. The decrease in working capital was primarily due to payment of dividends of 2,366,000 and repurchases of common stock of 1,083,000. 

 Net
cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 68,000 from 753,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023, to 685,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

 Net
cash provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 9,736,000 to 1,614,000 as compared
to 11,350,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of net investment shifting materially in 2023 from
marketable securities to investments in securities classified as cash and cash equivalents. 

 Net
cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 3,510,000 and 3,159,000, respectively.
The change of 351,000 primarily resulted from an increase in repurchases of common stock of 378,000 in 2024. 

 We
maintain our cash in money market funds, government securities, certificates of deposit and short-term fixed income securities. Accordingly,
we do not believe that our investments have significant exposure to interest rate risk. 

 OFF-BALANCE
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

 We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

 CONTRACTUAL
OBLIGATIONS 

 We
do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, purchase obligations or other long-term liabilities. 

 CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

 Our
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements
included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q requires management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting periods. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results,
our financial condition or results of operations would be affected. We base our estimates on our own historical experience and other
assumptions that we believe are reasonable after taking account of our circumstances and expectations for the future based on available
information. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. 

27 

We
consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were
highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from
the period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact
on our financial condition or results of operations. There are items within our financial statements that require estimation but are
not deemed critical, as defined above.

Worlds patents, the oral argument on appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit took place on October 11. 2024 and a
decision is pending (see Note I[2] to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein), and (ii) on August
6, 2024, plaintiff Mitchell Mizel filed a putative class action against the Company and its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in the

an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Company strongly denied the allegations. On October
3, 2024, the litigation was settled on terms not material to the Company and the putative class action complaint was withdrawn with prejudice
(see Note I[4] to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein).
