If we are unable to drill the wells, and a suitable replacement well is not found, we would retain the non-refundable portion of the contract and return the remaining funds to the participant. Included in Restricted Cash are amounts for use in completion of turnkey drilling in progress. 

Losses on properties sold are recognized when incurred or when the properties are held for sale and the fair value of the properties is less than the carrying value. 

Beginning in 2020, the holders of the Preferred Stock became entitled to vote the number of shares of our common stock into which the shares of Preferred Stock would be entitled to convert. 

In accordance with ASC 480-10-S99-1.02, we have determined that the conversion or redemption of the Preferred Stock are outside the sole control of the Company and that they should be classified in mezzanine or temporary equity as redeemable noncontrolling interest beginning at the reporting period ended June 30, 2020. 

For 2023, the board authorized the payment of each quarterly dividend on shares of Preferred Stock as additional shares of Preferred Stock to be Paid-In-Kind and to be paid immediately following the end of the quarter. During 2024 and 2023 no cash was used to pay dividends on shares of the Preferred Stock. 

On October 11, 2024, we entered into an agreement with all of our preferred shareholders, to exchange their shares of Preferred Stock, thereby eliminating the class of stock. For further information see Note 9 Subsequent Events.

On February 9, 2024, Royale Energy, Inc. entered into a Secured Term Loan Note with Walou Investments, LP, a Texas limited partnership, which is under the direct and indirect control of Johnny Jordan, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Company s board of directors. In addition, Mr. Jordan is the beneficial owner of approximately of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock, as of September 30, 2024. The initial loan to the Company was which was received on February 9, 2024. The outstanding principal balance of the loan has an interest rate of . The Company began making monthly interest payments on March 1, 2024, and will continue until the original maturity date, August 1, 2025, when the unpaid principal balance would become due.

Generally, the words anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, may and similar expressions, identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature. Actual results could differ materially from the results described in the forward-looking statements due to the risks and uncertainties set forth under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and those described from time to time in our future reports filed with the SEC. 

The following discussion is qualified in its entirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the Company s financial statements, including the notes thereto, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

OVERVIEW 

Royale is an independent oil and natural gas producer. Royale s principal lines of business are the production and sale of oil and natural gas, acquisition of oil and gas lease interests and proved reserves, drilling of both exploratory and development wells, and sales of fractional working interests in wells to be drilled by Royale. Since 1993, Royale has primarily acquired and developed producing and non-producing natural gas properties in California. In December 2018, Royale became the operator of a newly acquired oil and gas property in Texas. The most significant factors affecting our results of operations are (i) changes in oil and natural gas prices, production levels and reserves, (ii) turnkey drilling activities, and (iii) the increase in future cost associated with abandonment of wells. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, we had a net loss of 2,065,017 and 503,761, respectively. The difference was due to gains on turnkey drilling recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, of 527,715 and 1,338,305, respectively. In addition, during the nine month period in 2024, we had higher lease impairments, bad debt expenses and interest expenses, more fully discussed below. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had net losses of 1,184,291 and 470,730, respectively. The difference was also due to higher lease impairments, bad debt expenses and interest expenses recorded during the three month period in 2024 when compared to the period in 2023. 

During the first nine months of 2024, revenues from oil and gas production increased 301,422 or 20.8 , to 1,749,120 in 2024 from revenues of 1,447,698 during the first nine months of 2023. This increase was mainly due to higher oil production volumes during the period in 2024. The net sales volume of oil and condensate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was approximately 21,079 barrels with an average price of 74.88 per barrel, versus 14,851 barrels with an average price of 73.20 per barrel for the nine months of 2023. This represents an increase in net sales volume of 6,228 barrels or 41.9 , which was due to wells completed and put online during the latter half of 2023 and first half of 2024. The net sales volume of natural gas for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was approximately 91,255 Mcf with an average price of 1.84 per Mcf, versus 101,324 Mcf with an average price of 3.51 per Mcf for the same period in 2023. This represents a decrease in net sales volume of 10,069 Mcf or 9.9 . The decrease in natural gas production volume was also due to the natural declines of our wells. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, revenues from oil and gas production increased 100,755 or 22.0 to 559,709 from the 2023 third quarter revenues of 458,954. This increase was also due to higher oil production volumes. The net sales volume of oil and condensate for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was approximately 6,800 barrels with an average price of 74.25 per barrel, versus 4,987 barrels with an average price of 76.19 per barrel for the third quarter of 2023. This represents an increase in net sales volume of 1,813 barrels or 36.4 for the quarter in 2024. The net sales volume of natural gas for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was approximately 30,182 Mcf with an average price of 1.79 per Mcf, versus 33,242 Mcf with an average price of 2.32 per Mcf for the third quarter of 2023. This represents a decrease in net sales volume of 3,060 Mcf or 9.2 for the quarter in 2023.

Oil and natural gas lease operating expenses decreased by 38,640 or 2.9 , to 1,292,525 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 1,331,165 for the same period in 2023. This decrease was due to lower water disposal hauling costs paid to outside vendors, which decreased our trucking costs as we converted an existing non-producing oil well into a water injection well to reduce water disposal hauling costs in 2023. For the third quarter in 2024, lease operating expenses increased 196,037 or 62.0 from the same quarter in 2023, primarily due to repairs and restoration of well equipment in our Jameson field due to weather related damage. 

The aggregate of supervisory fees and other income was 44,963 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 12,209 from 32,754 during the same period in 2023. During the third quarter 2024, supervisory fees and other income increased 6,624 when compared to the quarter in 2023. These increases were mainly due to higher interest income on our bank balances. 

Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased to 253,726 from 231,224, an increase of 22,502 or 9.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. During the third quarter 2024, depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses decreased 770 or 1.3 . The depletion rate is calculated using production as a percentage of reserves. The increase in depletion expense was due to a decrease in expected recoverable reserves which increased the depletion rate. 

At September 30, 2024, Royale Energy had a Deferred Drilling Obligation of 11,328,332. During the first nine months of 2024, we removed 3,371,095 of drilling obligations as we participated in the drilling and completion of two oil wells in the Texas Permian basin, while incurring expenses of 2,843,380, resulting in a gain of 527,715. At September 30, 2023, Royale Energy had a Deferred Drilling Obligation of 9,761,927. At September 30, 2023, Royale Energy had a Deferred Drilling Obligation of 10,140,855. During the first nine months of 2023, we removed 2,561,610 of drilling obligations as we completed one oil well in our Texas Jameson field and participated in the drilling and completion of an oil well in the Texas Permian basin, while incurring expenses of 1,223,305, resulting in a gain of 1,338,305. 

General and administrative expenses decreased by 64,865 or 5.1 from 1,262,542 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 1,197,677 for the same period in 2024. For the second quarter 2024, general and administrative expenses decreased 14,727 or 3.8 when compared to the same period in 2023. These decreases were mainly due to lower employee and board related expenses due to cost reduction measures during the periods in 2024. For the first nine months of 2024, marketing expenses increased 39,702 or 17.2 to 269,984, compared to 230,282 for the first nine months of 2023. For the third quarter 2024, marketing expenses increased 44,820 or 53.8 when compared to the third quarter in 2023. Marketing expense varies from period to period according to the number of marketing events attended by personnel and their associated costs. 

Legal and accounting expense increased to 485,114 for the nine-month period in 2024, compared to 368,810 for the same period in 2023, a 116,304 or 31.5 . This increase during the period in 2024 was primarily due to higher legal fees related to our debt facility entered into during the first quarter of 2024, and preparation of the transaction documents related to the conversion of the Series B Convertible Preferred shares described in Note 9. For the third quarter 2024, legal and accounting expenses increased 47,283 or 49.4 , when compared to the third quarter in 2023, primarily due to fees related to conversion document preparation. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded Bad Debts expense of 279,491 which arose from identified uncollectable receivables relating to our oil and natural gas properties either plugged and abandoned or scheduled for plugging and abandonment P A and our period end oil and natural gas reserve values. We periodically review our accounts receivable from working interest owners to determine whether collection of any of these charges appears doubtful. During the period in 2024, we also recorded lease impairments of 400,554 on various lease and land costs in our California fields where the carrying value exceeded the fair value, no lease impairments were recorded in the first nine months of 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a gain on other of 54,975 as we reconciled employee related items previously recorded as liabilities. We also recorded a gain on other of approximately 57,000 on our share of property tax refunds for prior years received by RMX Resources, LLC during the period in 2023. During the period in 2023, we recorded a write down of 9,840 on certain well equipment that was either written down to its current market value or written off as it was no longer usable. 

Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, were 207,744 and 1,383, respectively. The higher 2024 interest expense was due to the 1.4 million note payable obtained in February 2024, discussed in Note 8.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 

At September 30, 2024, we had current assets totaling 8,971,747 and current liabilities totaling 19,962,529, a 10,990,782 working capital deficit. We had 1,737,465 in cash and 4,032,800 in restricted cash at September 30, 2024, compared to 2,202,521 in cash and 3,325,000 in restricted cash at December 31, 2023. 

At September 30, 2024, our other receivables, which consist of joint interest billing receivables from direct working interest investors and industry partners, totaled 622,921 compared to 1,036,401 at December 31, 2023, a 413,480 or 39.9 decrease. This decrease was mainly due to lower accounts receivables from payment of Joint Interest Bills by direct working interest owners for lease operating expenses from our Texas Jameson wells. At September 30, 2024, revenue receivable was 513,418 a decrease of 364,960, compared to 878,378 at December 31, 2023, due to lower production volumes during the third quarter in 2024 when compared to the year-end 2023. At September 30, 2024, our accounts payable and accrued expenses totaled 6,240,895 an increase of 758,821 from the accounts payable at December 31, 2023 of 5,482,074, which was mainly due to higher trade payables primarily related to drilling costs during the period in 2024. 

We have had recurring operating and net losses and cash used in operations and the financial statements reflect a working capital deficiency of 10,990,782 and an accumulated deficit of 93,042,036. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We anticipate that our primary sources of liquidity will be from the sale of oil and gas in the course of normal operations, the sale of oil and gas property, sales of participation interest and possible issuance of debt and/or equity. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations or financing sources, it may become necessary to curtail, suspend or cease operations, sell property, or enter into financing transaction(s) on less favorable terms; any such outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Management plans to continue to increase revenues by making commitments to participate with industry partners in drilling wells in the Permian basin and will also continue to drill and workover wells in our Texas Jameson field. Although there are no assurances, Management believes that expected increases in revenue together with reduced capital expenditures for drilling will allow the company to meet its liquidity needs through the remainder of the year. 

Operating Activities. Net cash used in operating activities totaled 1,381,384 and 198,937 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This difference in cash was mainly due to an increase in accounts payable and expenses during the period in 2024 mainly due to drilling and lease costs when compared to the period in 2023. 

Investing Activities. Net cash provided by investing activities totaled 231,089 and 1,337 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the nine-month period in 2024, we received approximately 4.9 million in drilling funds while our drilling and lease expenditures were approximately 4.7 million as we participated in the drilling and completion of two oil wells in the Texas Permian basin and obtained lease interests in the Permian basin. During the nine-month period in 2023, we received approximately 4.6 million in drilling funds while our drilling expenditures were approximately 4.6 million as we drilled and completed one Texas oil well and participated in the drilling and completion of a Texas Permian basin oil well. 

Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled 1,393,039 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net cash used in financing activities totaled 8,916 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The difference in cash was due to receipt of 1.4 million from the note payable discussed in Note 8. During the nine-month periods in 2024 and 2023, 6,961 and 8,916, respectively, were used for principal payments on our financing lease payments.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures of a registrant designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the registrant in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is properly recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include processes to accumulate and evaluate relevant information and communicate such information to a registrant s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As of December 31, 2023, our management, including our Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as required by Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Based on the evaluation described above, the company concluded that there was a material weakness in our disclosure controls and procedures. These controls and procedures are based on the definition of disclosure controls and procedures in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

As a result of the review by the CFO and CEO, the material weakness was identified as listed below. 

In connection with the audit of our 2023 consolidated financial statements, management has identified a material weakness that exists because we did not maintain effective controls over our financial close and reporting process, and has concluded that the financial close and reporting process needs additional formal procedures to ensure that appropriate reviews occur on all financial reporting analysis. Management has designed and implemented updated control procedures that we believe will mitigate this material weakness and is monitoring these procedures for effectiveness. 

Because of the material weaknesses described above, our management was unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of period to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 

Notwithstanding the material weaknesses described above, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the fiscal periods presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, the material weakness described did not result in the restatements of any of our audited or unaudited consolidated financial statements or disclosures for any previously reported periods. 

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 

Except for the actions described above, that were taken to address the material weaknesses, there were no changes in our internal controls during the period ended September 30, 2024, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
