 on the first billion of annual global net sales and for all annual global net sales above billion; and royalties from the sales of ANORO ELLIPTA , which tier upward at a range from to .

We commenced commercial sales of XACDURO in the third quarter of 2023. Our development pipeline includes zoliflodacin, an investigational treatment for uncomplicated gonorrhea that reported positive data in a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial on November 1, 2023. As such, we have a wholly owned robust critical care and infectious disease operating platform with a hospital focus anchored by three differentiated products with growth potential and a late-stage drug candidate. In addition, we own other strategic healthcare assets, such as a large equity stake in Armata Pharmaceuticals, a leader in development of bacteriophages with potential use across a range of infectious and other serious diseases.

We derived over and of our net product sales from customers located in the U.S. for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. License Revenue Refer to the out-license agreements with Zai Lab and Everest in Note 4, License and Collaboration Arrangements . 

 15 

million in research and development support payments and development, regulatory and sales milestone payments related to SUL-DUR, imipenem and other combinations with the licensed products. Zai Lab will pay us a tiered royalty equal to from a high-single digit to low-double digit percentage based on annual net sales of licensed products in the territory, subject to specified reductions for the market entry of competing products, loss of patent coverage of licensed products and for payments owed to third parties for additional rights necessary to commercialize licensed products in the territory. Payments received for research support and reimbursable clinical trial costs are recorded as a reduction to research and development expense during the period in which the qualifying expenses are incurred. Such amounts recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were not material. SUL-DUR was approved by China s National Medical Products Administration in May 2024, and we recognized million in license revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 under this agreement. Following the approval of XACDURO by the FDA in May 2023, we recognized million in license revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In April 2024, we entered into an amendment to the Zai Agreement (the Amended Zai Agreement ), pursuant to which Zai Lab shall share costs associated with certain new manufacturing and technology transfer activities for XACDURO (the Services ), which were not contemplated under the Zai Agreement and are crucial for regulatory approval in the Asia-Pacific region. We determined that the Amended Zai Agreement falls within the scope of ASC 606 and Zai Lab is a customer in this arrangement as the Services are an output of our ordinary activities. We have determined that the Services represent the only performance obligation and are distinct from the performance obligations under the original Zai Agreement. In addition, the costs we incur in performing the Services most accurately depict the transfer of value to Zai Lab and maximize the use of observable inputs for measuring progress, therefore, we recognize revenue from this arrangement as the costs related to Services are incurred. We recognized million and million in license revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, under the Amended Zai Agreement. This amount is included in Accounts receivable in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. In June 2024, we entered into an interim supply agreement with Zai Lab, under which Zai Lab shall purchase XACDURO inventory (the Supplied Inventory for their commercial launch. We have determined that this agreement falls within the scope of ASC 606. Zai Lab is a customer and the Supplied Inventory is an output of our ordinary activities. We have also determined that the Supplied Inventory represents the only performance obligation and is distinct from the performance obligations under the Zai agreements discussed above. Furthermore, we evaluated that the performance obligation is satisfied over time and that a cost-to-cost measure of progress would be the measure of progress that most accurately depicts the transfer of value to Zai Lab and maximizes the use of observable inputs to measure progress. We recognized million in net product sales for the Supplied Inventory for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. This amount is included in Accounts receivable in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024.

Under the terms of the GARDP Collaboration Agreement, GARDP will use commercially reasonable endeavors to perform and fully fund the Phase 3 registrational trial, including the manufacture and supply of the product candidate containing zoliflodacin, in uncomplicated gonorrhea. We recorded immaterial reimbursements from GARDP under this agreement as reduction to research and development expense during the periods presented. In addition, under the GARDP Collaboration Agreement, GARDP was granted a worldwide, fully paid, exclusive and royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, to use our zoliflodacin technology in connection with GARDP s development, manufacture and commercialization of zoliflodacin in low-income and specified middle-income countries. We retained commercial rights in all other countries worldwide, including the major markets in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. We also retained the right to use and grant licenses to our zoliflodacin technology to perform our obligations under the GARDP Collaboration Agreement and for any purpose other than gonorrhea or community-acquired indications.

million of our outstanding shares of common stock. The repurchase program authorized the repurchase by the Company of its common stock in open market transactions, including pursuant to a trading plan in accordance with Rule 10b-18 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), privately negotiated transactions, in block trades, accelerated share repurchase transactions, exchange transactions, or any combination thereof or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws. The authorization permitted management to repurchase shares of the Company s common stock from time to time at management s discretion. Repurchases may also be made pursuant to a trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, which would permit shares to be repurchased when the Company might otherwise be precluded from doing so because of self-imposed trading blackout periods or other regulatory restrictions. The share repurchase program was completed in April 2024. From January to April 2024, we repurchased shares in the open market at an average price of per share for a total amount of approximately million. All repurchased shares were retired. In April 2024, we retired all the shares held in treasury resulting from our strategic buyback of GSK s common shares in the Company in 2021. We recorded the corresponding cost of treasury stock of million in additional paid-in capital.

Convertible Subordinated Notes Due 2023 In January 2013, we completed an underwritten public offering of million aggregate principal amount of our 2023 Notes, which matured on January 15, 2023. The remaining balance of the 2023 Notes of million was fully paid upon the maturity date. Convertible Senior Notes Due 2025 On August 7, 2017, we completed a private placement of million aggregate principal amount of our 2025 Notes. The proceeds include the 2025 Notes sold pursuant to the million over-allotment option granted by us to the initial purchasers, which option was exercised in full. The 2025 Notes were sold in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The 2025 Notes are senior unsecured obligations and bear interest at a rate of per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2018. The 2025 Notes are convertible, based on the applicable conversion rate, into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election. The initial conversion rate for the 2025 Notes is shares of our common stock per 1,000 principal amount of the 2025 Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share), representing a conversion premium over the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock on August 1, 2017, which was per share. The conversion rate is subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments in certain circumstances. The 2025 Notes will mature on , unless repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. Prior to February 15, 2025, the 2025 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders only upon the occurrence of specified events and during certain periods, as described below.

Convertible Senior Notes Due 2028 In March 2022, we completed a private placement of million aggregate principal amount of our 2028 Notes, which will mature on . The proceeds include the 2028 Notes sold pursuant to the million over-allotment option granted by us to the initial purchasers, of which million was exercised. The 2028 Notes were sold in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The net proceeds from the sale of the million aggregate principal amount of 2028 Notes were approximately million after deducting the initial purchasers discounts and commissions and our estimated offering expenses. We used approximately million of the net proceeds from the offering to fund the cost of entering into the capped call transactions described below. In addition, we used million of the remaining net proceeds to repurchase million aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes in separate and individually negotiated transactions with certain holders of the 2023 Notes, which closed concurrently with the issuance of the 2028 Notes. We expect to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes.

that is payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2022. The 2028 Notes are convertible, based on the applicable conversion rate, into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election. The initial conversion rate was shares per 1,000 principal amount of the 2028 Notes, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustment in certain circumstances, which represented an initial conversion price of approximately per share. Prior to September 15, 2027, the 2028 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders only upon the occurrence of specified events and during certain periods, and will be convertible on or after September 15, 2027, at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the 2028 Notes. Holders of the 2028 Notes may convert all or a portion of their 2028 Notes prior to the close of business on September 15, 2027, only under the following circumstances: after March 31, 2022, if our closing common stock price for at least 20 days out of the most recent 30 consecutive trading days of the preceding quarter is greater than of the current conversion price of the 2028 Notes; 

 for five consecutive business days, if the average trading price per 1,000 of Notes during the prior 10 consecutive trading days is less than of the product of our closing common stock price and the conversion rate of the 2028 Notes on such day; and, 

 upon the occurrence of specified corporate events, including certain distributions, the occurrence of a fundamental changes (as defined in the indenture governing the 2028 Notes) or a transaction resulting in our common stock converting into other securities or property or assets. 

 On or after September 15, 2027, holders of the 2028 Notes may convert their 2028 Notes at any time until the close of the business on the second day immediately preceding the maturity date of the 2028 Notes. The 2028 Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at our option at any time, and from time to time, on or after March 20, 2025, and on or before the 75th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date but only if the last reported sale price per share of our common stock exceeds 130 of the conversion price for a specified period of time. The redemption price will be equal to the principal amount of the 2028 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. In addition, calling any 2028 Note for redemption will constitute a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the 2028 Notes) with respect to that 2028 Note, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of that 2028 Note will be increased in certain circumstances if it is converted after it is called for redemption. If we undergo a fundamental change, subject to certain conditions, holders may require us to purchase for cash all or any portion of their 2028 Notes. The fundamental change purchase price will be of the principal amount of the 2028 Notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change purchase date. In connection with the offering of the 2028 Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions. The cap price of the capped call transaction is initially per share and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the capped call transactions. The capped call transactions cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of common stock initially underlying the 2028 Notes. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to our common stock upon conversion of the 2028 Notes or at our election (subject to certain conditions) offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the aggregate principal amount of converted 2028 Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction or offset subject to a cap. The annual effective interest rate on the 2028 Notes is .

Deferred Royalty Obligation As part of our acquisition of La Jolla, we recorded the fair value of its deferred royalty obligation in connection with La Jolla s royalty financing agreement La Jolla Royalty Agreement with HealthCare Royalty Partners HCR ). Under the terms of the La Jolla Royalty Agreement, HCR is entitled to receive quarterly royalties on worldwide net sales of GIAPREZA until either January 1, 2031 or when the maximum aggregate royalty payments have been made, whichever occurs first. Quarterly payments to HCR under the Royalty Agreement start at a maximum royalty rate, with step-downs based on the achievement of annual net product sales thresholds. The maximum royalty rate through December 31, 2023 was . Starting January 1, 2024, the maximum royalty rate was increased to based on the terms of the agreement. The La Jolla Royalty Agreement is subject to maximum aggregate royalty payments to HCR of million. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized interest expense of million and million, respectively. The carrying value of the deferred royalty obligation as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was million and million, respectively (refer to Note 8 Balance Sheet Components . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we made royalty payments to HCR of million. The deferred royalty obligation was valued using Level 3 inputs, and its carrying value as of September 30, 2024 approximates fair value. The fair value of the deferred royalty obligation was calculated as the discounted deferred royalty obligations based on risk-adjusted revenue projections for GIAPREZA . The annual effective interest rate of the deferred royalty obligation for the current period is . Under the terms of the La Jolla Royalty Agreement, if we are unable to meet certain obligations, including the obligation to use commercially reasonable and diligent efforts to commercialize GIAPREZA , HCR would have the right to terminate the La Jolla Royalty Agreement and demand payment of either million or million (depending on which obligation we have failed to meet) less aggregate royalties already paid to HCR. As of September 30, 2024 , inclusive of the aggregate royalties paid to HCR by La Jolla under the La Jolla Royalty Agreement prior to our acquisition, La Jolla paid million of aggregate royalties to HCR. In the event that we fail to pay such amount if and when due in a timely manner, HCR would have the right to foreclose on the GIAPREZA -related assets. HCR has no recourse against any asset other than GIAPREZA .

 OVERVIEW 
 Executive Summary 
 Innoviva, Inc. (and where context requires, together with its subsidiaries referred to as Innoviva , the Company , or we and other similar pronouns) is a company with a portfolio of royalties and innovative healthcare assets. Our royalty portfolio contains respiratory assets partnered with Glaxo Group Limited GSK ), including RELVAR /BREO ELLIPTA (fluticasone furoate/vilanterol, FF/VI and ANORO ELLIPTA (umeclidinium bromide/ vilanterol, UMEC/VI ). Under the Long-Acting 
 38 

Beta2 Agonist LABA Collaboration Agreement, Innoviva is entitled to receive royalties from GSK on sales of RELVAR /BREO ELLIPTA as follows: 15 on the first 3.0 billion of annual global net sales and 5 for all annual global net sales above 3.0 billion; and royalties from the sales of ANORO ELLIPTA , which tier upward at a range from 6.5 to 10 . 
 We expanded our portfolio through the acquisition of Entasis Therapeutics Holdings Inc. Entasis on July 11, 2022 and the acquisition of La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company La Jolla on August 22, 2022. Our commercial and marketed products include GIAPREZA (angiotensin II), approved to increase blood pressure in adults with septic or other distributive shock, and XERAVA (eravacycline) approved for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections in adults. Our third product, XACDURO (formerly known as sulbactam-durlobactam or SUL-DUR), was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration FDA for the treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonias caused by Acinetobacter in adults on May 23, 2023. We commenced commercial sales of XACDURO in the third quarter of 2023. Our development pipeline includes zoliflodacin, an investigational treatment for uncomplicated gonorrhea that reported positive data in a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial on November 1, 2023. As such, we have a wholly owned robust critical care and infectious disease operating platform with a hospital focus anchored by three differentiated products with significant growth potential and a promising drug candidate. 
 In addition, we own other strategic healthcare assets, such as a large equity stake in Armata Pharmaceuticals Armata ), a leader in development of bacteriophages with potential use across a range of infectious and other serious diseases. We also have economic interests in other healthcare companies. 
 Our corporate strategy is currently focused on increasing stockholder value by, among other things, maximizing the potential value of our respiratory assets partnered with GSK, optimizing our operations and augmenting capital allocation. We continue to diversify our royalty management business through actively pursuing opportunistic acquisitions of promising companies and assets in the healthcare industry and enhancing the returns on our capital. In particular, our recent acquisitions of Entasis and La Jolla created a robust hospital and infectious disease platform. 
 Third Quarter 2024 and Recent Highlights: 
 Financial Highlights 
 Third quarter 2024 gross royalty revenue from GSK was 60.5 million, compared to 57.0 million for the third quarter 2023. 

Third quarter 2024 net product sales were 27.8 million, which included U.S. net product sales of 19.7 million and ex-U.S. product sales of 8.1 million. U.S. net product sales consisted of 13.1 million from GIAPREZA , 2.3 million from XERAVA , and 4.3 million from XACDURO , a 68 increase compared to 11.8 million for the third quarter 2023. 

Key Business and R D Highlights 
 XACDURO (sulbactam for injection; durlobactam for injection), co-packaged for intravenous use, a targeted antibacterial treatment for patients with hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP) caused by susceptible isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii calcoaceticus complex. 

o XACDURO was recently nominated for the 2024 Prix Galien USA Award for Best Biotechnology Product, which recognizes excellence in scientific innovation that improves the state of human health. 

Zoliflodacin : a potential first-in-class, single dose, oral antibiotic is currently being developed in partnership with The Global Antibiotic Research Development Partnership (GARDP) for the treatment of patients with uncomplicated gonorrhea. 

o In September 2024, we presented additional findings on its investigational agent zoliflodacin at the 2024 Sexually Transmitted Infections Prevention Conference in Atlanta. The first oral presentation demonstrated that zoliflodacin had potent in vitro activity against 200 clinical isolates, consistent with previous US surveillance data. The second presentation demonstrated that microbiological cure rates for specific subgroups were comparable to the primary endpoint analysis. Safety in these subgroups was also comparable. 

o In October 2024, we had five clinical presentations at IDWeek 2024, which took place in Los Angeles. One oral presentation on zoliflodacin included a review of the unique public-private partnership that led the clinical development of zoliflodacin. The second presentation highlighted the activity of sulbactam-durlobactam and standard-of-care antibiotics against Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex for hospitalized patients in the 

39 

US. Three posters were presented including two on zoliflodacin: In vitro activity against baseline isolates in US participants from the phase 3 trial and a pharmacometrics analysis supporting dose selection. Surveillance data of eravacycline against clinical pathogens, collected worldwide from multiple infections sites during 2018-2022 was also presented. 

o We continue to advance zoliflodacin following its successful Phase 3 clinical trial results and expect to submit an NDA to the U.S. FDA in early 2025. 

Collaboration Arrangement with GSK 
 LABA Collaboration 
 In November 2002, we entered into the LABA collaboration with GSK to develop and commercialize once-daily LABA products for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder COPD and asthma (the LABA Collaboration Agreement ). For the treatment of COPD, the collaboration has developed the following combination products: 
 RELVAR /BREO ELLIPTA FF/VI (BREO ELLIPTA is the proprietary name in the U.S. and Canada and RELVAR ELLIPTA is the proprietary name outside the U.S. and Canada), a once-daily combination medicine consisting of a LABA, vilanterol (VI), and an inhaled corticosteroid ICS ), fluticasone furoate FF ), and 

ANORO ELLIPTA UMEC/VI ), a once-daily medicine combining a long-acting muscarinic antagonist LAMA ), umeclidinium bromide UMEC ), with a LABA, vilanterol (VI). 

As a result of the launch and approval of RELVAR /BREO ELLIPTA and ANORO ELLIPTA in the U.S., Japan and Europe, in accordance with the LABA Collaboration Agreement, we paid milestone fees to GSK totaling 220.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. Although we have no further milestone payment obligations to GSK pursuant to the LABA Collaboration Agreement, we continue to have ongoing commercialization activities under the LABA Collaboration Agreement, including participation in the joint steering committee that are expected to continue over the life of the agreement. The milestone fees paid to GSK were recognized as capitalized fees, which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives commencing upon the commercial launch of the products. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe there have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies as described in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024, and as amended on March 5 and 22, 2024.

 We recognized 8.0 million in license revenue for the second quarter of 2024 as a result of achievement of a regulatory milestone under our license agreement with Zai Lab. We also recognized 6.5 million in license revenue for the second quarter of 2024 under the Amended Zai Agreement with Zai Lab. During the third quarter of 2024, we recognized additional license revenue of approximately 4.6 million from Zai Lab arising from a manufacturing stage transfer agreement and the aforementioned Amended Zai Agreement. 
 We recognized license revenue of 8.0 million for the first quarter of 2023 and 3.0 million for the second quarter of 2023 as a result of achievement of regulatory milestones under our license agreements with Everest and Zai Lab, respectively.

Our inventory includes net fair value adjustments resulting from the acquisition of La Jolla, which are being amortized and recognized as cost of products sold when sales occur. The fair value adjustments recorded as part of cost of products sold amounted to 1.8 million and 12.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 5.4 million and 19.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Excluding the impact of the amortized fair value adjustments, our cost of products sold increased during the periods presented in 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 as a result of higher sales volume.

Research and development expenses, which are mainly attributable to post-marketing commitments required by the FDA and ongoing product developments, were 3.6 million and 10.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Research and development expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, which were mainly attributable to the product development efforts for XACDURO , were 4.0 million and 31.6 million, respectively. The decrease was primarily a result of the FDA approval of XACDURO in May 2023 and personnel transfers from the research development function to general and administrative function after the FDA approval.

Our selling, general and administrative expenses are primarily incurred as a result of our ongoing efforts to promote our marketed critical care products and drive revenue, maintain regulatory compliance, and support essential administrative functions for general operations. The expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023 were higher compared to the same period this year primarily due to the commercial launch effort of XACDURO . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the expenses increased compared to the same period last year due to the ongoing efforts, which led to higher net product sales.

Interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 comprised mainly of the contractual interest expense and the amortization of debt issuance costs for our 2025 Notes and 2028 Notes, as well as effective interest expense on our deferred royalty obligation. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included the amount on the 2023 Notes until the notes were fully paid off on January 15, 2023. The increase for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, was mainly due to higher effective interest rate on our deferred royalty obligation as a result of higher sales performance of GIAPREZA .

Not Meaningful 
 The changes in fair values of equity method investments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were unfavorable mainly due to the decrease in Armata's stock price during this period. We recorded 18.2 million and 43.0 million in unrealized loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 72.0 million and 67.9 million in unrealized gain for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, related to our equity method investments in Armata. 
 43 

The changes in fair values of other equity and long-term investments primarily reflected the realized gains and losses and net unrealized gains and losses in our strategic investments in Armata, InCarda, Gate, ImaginAb and those investments managed by ISP Fund LP. We recorded 17.8 million and 59.8 million of net negative changes in fair values of equity and long-term investments related to the investments managed by ISP Fund LP, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. We also recorded 1.2 million net positive and 0.8 million net negative changes in fair values of equity and long-term investments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, related to other long-term investments we made in Armata. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 We recorded income tax expense of 5.6 million and 9.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to income tax expense of 3.9 million and 14.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 40.5 and 10.6 , respectively. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity 
 Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through private placements and public offerings of equity and debt securities and payments received under collaboration arrangement. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated gross royalty revenues from GSK of 189.6 million, net product sales of 68.6 million and license revenue of 19.1 million. Net cash and cash equivalents totaled 260.6 million, royalties receivable from GSK totaled 60.5 million and accounts receivable associated with our product sales and license revenue totaled 30.5 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 Adequacy of Cash Resources to Meet Future Needs 
 We believe that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated debt service and operating needs, as well our ongoing share repurchase program, for at least the next 12 months based upon current operating plans and financial forecasts. Our long-term capital requirements will depend on many factors including the amount of our royalty revenues, sales growth of our currently marketed products, timing of regulatory approval of our product candidates and outcome of our acquisitions and strategic investments. If our current operating plans and financial forecasts change, we may require additional funding sooner in the form of public or private equity offerings or debt financings. Furthermore, if in our view favorable financing opportunities arise, we may seek additional funding in the form of public or private equity offerings or debt financings at any time. However, future financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. This could leave us without adequate financial resources to fund our operations as currently planned. In addition, from time to time we may restructure or reduce our debt, including through privately negotiated repurchases, tender offers, redemptions, amendments, or otherwise, all allowable with the terms of our debt agreements.

 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 14.0 million was primarily due to 14.8 million for the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program which concluded in April 2024. 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 157.3 million was primarily due to the payments of 96.2 million upon maturity of the 2023 Notes in January 2023 and 61.1 million for the repurchase of common stock under our current stock repurchase program. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 As of September 30, 2024, our notes payable obligation included 192.5 million related to our 2025 Notes and 261.0 million related to our 2028 Notes, which are due in 2025 and 2028, respectively. Under the terms of the 2025 Notes and 2028 Notes, we will make interest payments of 2.5 and 2.125 , respectively, of outstanding principal. Refer to Note 11, Debt to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 
 Our short-term and long-term obligations also include contractual payments related to our operating leases were 3.4 million, with approximately 0.4 million payable through December 31, 2024, and approximately 3.0 million payable through 2029. Refer to Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 
 As part of our acquisition of La Jolla, we recognized its deferred royalty obligation in connection with the La Jolla Royalty Agreement with HCR. Under the terms of the Agreement, HCR is entitled to receive quarterly royalties on worldwide net sales of GIAPREZA until either January 1, 2031 or when the maximum aggregate royalty payments have been made, whichever occurs first. Quarterly payments to HCR under the Royalty Agreement start at a maximum royalty rate, with step-downs based on the achievement of annual net product sales thresholds. The maximum royalty rate through December 31, 2023 was 14 . Starting January 1, 2024, the maximum royalty rate was increased to 18 based on the terms of the agreement. The La Jolla Royalty Agreement is subject to maximum aggregate royalty payments to HCR of 225.0 million. 
 Additionally, we have certain contingent payment obligations under various in-license agreements which we are required to make royalty payments or milestone payments upon successful completion and achievement of certain milestones. Refer to Note 4, License and Collaboration Arrangements to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 
 We also entered into a Commercial Supply Agreement with Corden Pharma CHEN VE SAS Corden ), under which we engaged Corden to manufacture and supply certain products related to XACDURO and to perform certain services and studies. Under the agreement, we committed to minimum purchase commitments through December 31, 2027. As of September 30, 2024, we have approximately 9.1 million, 7.1 million, 7.9 million and 6.3 million in outstanding purchase commitments under the agreement for the remainder of 2024 and for the years 2025, 2026 and 2027, respectively. 
 
 45 

We also enter into other agreements in the normal course of business with vendors for commercial, manufacturing, clinical trials and preclinical studies, and other services and products for operating purposes. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, our debt bears fixed interest rates and we had no outstanding debt with variable interest rate. Our cash flows on these debt obligations are not subject to variability as a result of changes in interest rates. 
 We are exposed to changes in the fair value of certain or our investments in equity and debt securities. Fluctuations in the underlying fair value of the investments could result in material gains or losses. Refer to Note 6 Equity and Other Investments and Fair Value Measurements to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 
 Inflation has increased in recent periods and could continue to increase for the near future. Inflationary factors, such as increases in the cost of our raw materials, supplies, interest rates and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, we may experience some effect in the near future if inflation rates continue to rise. Significant adverse changes in inflation and prices in the future could result in material losses. 
 We may face foreign exchange risk as a result of entering into transactions denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, including contracts with international vendors related to raw material purchases. Our royalty revenue from RELVAR /BREO ELLIPTA and ANORO ELLIPTA is also indirectly exposed to foreign exchange risk as GSK also markets and sells the products outside the U.S. The majority of our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and the majority of our vendor relationships are denominated in U.S. dollars. Therefore, we do not believe that the risk of a significant impact on our operating income from foreign currency fluctuations is substantial. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We conducted an evaluation as of September 30, 2024, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. These controls and procedures, as defined under SEC rules, are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the timeframes specified by the Commission s rules and forms. Additionally, they ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer is accumulated and communicated to management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, to enable timely decision regarding required disclosure. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance levels. 
 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all frauds. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefit of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Innoviva have been detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no material changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, the Company is involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of its business. We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings except as discussed below. 
 On February 15, 2022, La Jolla received a paragraph IV notice of certification (the First Notice Letter from Gland Pharma Limited Gland advising that Gland had submitted an Abbreviated New Drug Application ANDA to the FDA seeking approval to manufacture, use or sell a generic version of GIAPREZA in the U.S. prior to the expiration of U.S. Patent Nos.: 9,220,745; 9,572,856; 9,867,863; 10,028,995; 10,335,451; 10,493,124; 10,500,247; 10,548,943; 11,096,983; and 11,219,662 (the GIAPREZA Patents ), which are listed in the FDA s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the Orange Book ). The First Notice Letter alleges that the GIAPREZA Patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by the commercial manufacture, use or sale of the generic product described in Gland s ANDA. 
 On March 29, 2022, La Jolla filed a complaint for patent infringement of the GIAPREZA Patents against Gland and certain related entities in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey in response to Gland s ANDA filing. In accordance with the Hatch-Waxman Act, because GIAPREZA is a new chemical entity and La Jolla filed a complaint for patent infringement within 45 days of receipt of the First Notice Letter, the FDA cannot approve Gland s ANDA any earlier than 7.5 years from the approval of the GIAPREZA NDA unless the District Court finds that all of the asserted claims of the patents-in-suit are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. 
 On February 22, 2023, La Jolla received a paragraph IV notice of certification (the Second Notice Letter from Gland advising that Gland had amended its ANDA filing to include a paragraph IV certification alleging that all claims of the newly-issued and Orange Book-listed U.S. Patent No. 11,559,559 (the 559 Patent ), which covers GIAPREZA , are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. 
 On March 22, 2023, La Jolla filed a First Amended Complaint in this litigation adding Gland s marketing and distribution partners for its ANDA angiotensin II product, Fresenius Kabi USA LLC and Fresenius Kabi SwissBiosim GmbH (collectively, the Fresenius Kabi Defendants ), as co-defendants. On April 7, 2023, La Jolla filed a Second Amended Complaint in response to the Second Notice Letter, adding claims that the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale, or import of Gland s ANDA angiotensin II product will infringe the 559 Patent. On November 14, 2023, La Jolla filed a Third Amended Complaint adding additional infringement claims against the Fresenius Kabi Defendants. We intend to vigorously enforce our intellectual property rights relating to GIAPREZA . 
 Fact discovery closed on March 31, 2024 and expert discovery was completed on August 19, 2024. 
 On September 13, 2024, La Jolla filed a motion for partial summary judgment of infringement regarding three claims from U.S. Patent Nos. 10,548,943 and 10,335,451. Briefing for this motion concluded on October 15, 2024. The court has not yet rendered a decision on this motion. 
 A trial date has not yet been set in this matter. 
 Given the current status of this matter, we cannot reasonably estimate a potential future loss or a range of potential future losses, if any, and have not recorded a contingent liability accrual as of September 30, 2024. 
 Item 1 A. Risk Factors 
 Our business is subject to a number of risks, including those identified in Item 1A of Part I of our 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to the risk factors described in our 2023 Form 10-K.
