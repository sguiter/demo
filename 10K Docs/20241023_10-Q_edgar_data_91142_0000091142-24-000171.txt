 Additionally, certain customers in China pay the Company prior to the shipment of products resulting in a customer deposits liability of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Customer deposit liabilities are short term in nature, recognized into revenue within one year of receipt. The Company assesses the collectability of customer receivables based on the creditworthiness of a customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer s payment history. In determining the allowance for credit losses, the Company also considers various factors including the aging of customer accounts and historical write-offs. In addition, the Company monitors other risk factors including forward-looking information when establishing adequate allowances for credit losses, which reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the receivables. The Company s allowance for credit losses was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 reporting segments: North America and Rest of World. The Rest of World segment is primarily comprised of China, Europe and India. Both segments manufacture and market comprehensive lines of residential and commercial gas, heat pump and electric water heaters, boilers, tanks and water treatment products. Both segments primarily manufacture and market in their respective regions of the world. 
 As each segment manufactures and markets products in its respective region of the world, the Company has determined that geography is the primary factor in reporting its sales. The Company further disaggregates its North America segment sales by major product line as each of North America s major product lines is sold through distinct distribution channels and these product lines may be impacted differently by certain economic factors. Within the Rest of World segment, particularly in China and India, the Company s major customers purchase across the Company s product lines, utilizing the same distribution channels regardless of product type. In addition, the impact of economic factors is unlikely to be differentiated by product line in the Rest of World segment. 
 The North America segment's major product lines are defined as the following: 
 Water heaters The Company s water heaters are open water heating systems that heat potable water. Typical applications for water heaters include residences, restaurants, hotels, office buildings, laundries, car washes and small businesses. The Company sells residential and commercial water heater products and related parts through its wholesale distribution channel, which includes more than independent wholesale plumbing distributors. The Company also sells residential water heaters and related parts through retail and maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) channels. A significant portion of the Company s water heater sales in the North America segment is derived from the replacement of existing products. 
 Boilers The Company s boilers are closed loop water heating systems used primarily for space heating or hydronic heating. The Company s boilers are primarily used in applications in commercial settings for hospitals, schools, hotels and other large commercial buildings while residential boilers are used in homes, apartments and condominiums. The Company s boiler distribution channel is comprised primarily of manufacturer representative firms, with the remainder of its boilers distributed through wholesale channels. The Company s boiler sales in the North America segment are derived from a combination of replacement of existing products and new construction. 
 Water treatment products The Company s water treatment products range from point-of-entry water softeners, solutions for problem well water, and whole-home water filtration products to on-the-go filtration bottles, point-of-use carbon, and reverse osmosis products. Typical applications for the Company s water treatment products include residences, restaurants, hotels and offices. The Company sells water treatment products through its retail and wholesale distribution channels, similar to water heaters. The Company s water treatment products are also sold through independent water quality dealers as well as directly to consumers including through e-commerce sales channels. A portion of the Company s sales of water treatment products in the North America segment is comprised of replacement filters.

 million, subject to customary adjustments. The Company expects to complete the acquisition of Pureit by the end of 2024 and does not expect the acquisition to have a material impact on earnings in the first year. 
 During the first quarter of 2024, the Company acquired a privately-held water treatment company. The Company paid an aggregate cash purchase price of million, net of cash acquired. The Company also agreed to make contingent payments based on the amount by which sales of products increase over the next . The addition of the acquired company expanded the Company's water treatment footprint in North America. The acquired company is included in the North America segment. 
 2023 Acquisition 
 During the third quarter of 2023, the Company acquired a privately-held water treatment company. The Company paid an aggregate cash purchase price of million, net of cash acquired, including an additional payment of million made in the fourth quarter of 2023. The addition of the acquired company expands the Company's water treatment footprint. The acquired company is included in the North America segment. 
 As required under ASC 805 Business Combinations, results of operations have been included in the Company s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. 
 Dispositions 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the Company continued the process of exiting its operations in Vietnam. The restructuring expense associated with the exit was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023 and did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
 During 2023, the Company sold its business in Turkey (disposal group), which was included in the Company's Rest of World segment, for an amount that approximated the carrying value of the net assets. In the first quarter of 2023, the Company determined that the disposal group met the criteria to be classified as held for sale and that the fair value of the disposal group, less cost to sell, was lower than its carrying amount. As a result, in the first quarter of 2023, the Company recorded an impairment expense of million, of which million was recorded in the Rest of World segment, and million was recorded in Corporate Expense. The impairment was recorded as a net reduction of million to the assets and liabilities and million for the anticipated liquidation of the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment associated with the disposal group.

Both segments manufacture and market comprehensive lines of residential and commercial gas, heat pump and electric water heaters, boilers, tanks, and water treatment products. Both segments primarily manufacture and market in their respective region of the world. 
 Our supply chain has been relatively stable. However, we continue to monitor potential disruptions and increase our safety stock of key components when we believe it is warranted. We remain in close contact with our suppliers and logistics providers to resolve supply chain constraints as they arise. 
 We continue to seek acquisitions that enable geographic growth, expand our core business, and establish adjacencies. On July 15, 2024, we signed an agreement to acquire Pureit from Unilever for 120 million, subject to customary adjustments. We expect to close on the acquisition by the end of 2024. Pureit, a leading water purification business in South Asia, offers a broad range of residential water purification solutions and has annual sales of approximately USD 60 million, primarily in India. The acquisition fits squarely in the Company s core capabilities and would double the Company s market penetration in the South Asia region. In the first quarter of 2024, we acquired Impact Water Products, a privately-held water treatment company. The acquisition supports our growth strategy by expanding the West Coast presence of our water treatment business. 
 Also, we continue to look for opportunities to add to our existing product portfolio in high growth regions demonstrated by our previous introductions of kitchen products in China. We also recently introduced our internally designed and manufactured gas tankless water heaters in North America. In addition, we are expanding our commercial water heater capacity in preparation for the new efficiency rule for commercial water heaters that the Department of Energy (DOE) has adopted that will take effect in 2026. 
 In our North America segment, we saw soft residential and commercial water heater order demand in the third quarter after a strong first half of the year. We believe that a pre-buy ahead of our March 1st price increase pulled forward some demand into the first half of the year. We also believe our third quarter order demand was negatively impacted by our improved lead times. Those factors along with caution around softening end market demand may have driven some customers to reduce their inventory levels in the quarter. We project 2024 industry residential unit volumes will be flat after approximately six percent growth in 2023. Proactive replacement has been above historical levels for the last several years and we project that will continue in 2024. We believe that new home construction remains in a deficit and will be flat compared to 2023. We anticipate that commercial water heater industry volumes will be approximately flat in 2024 compared to 2023 as growth in commercial electric water heaters greater than 55 gallons will be offset by lower shipments of commercial gas water heaters.Sales of our boilers and water treatment products were negatively impacted by elevated channel inventories in 2023. We believe that channel inventories returned to near normal levels at the beginning of 2024 for both product categories and we saw a return to growth in the second quarter. We expect our boilers sales to grow approximately eight percent in 2024 compared to 2023 as we continue to benefit from the transition to higher efficiency boilers. We anticipate sales of our North America water treatment products will increase approximately eight to ten percent in 2024, compared to 2023, as we continue our geographic expansion. 
 In our Rest of World segment, after local currency third-party sales growth in China of four percent in the first half of 2024, our third quarter China sales declined 17 percent year-over-year as consumer demand headwinds were more significant than we expected. We project our third-party sales in China to decrease six to eight percent in 2024 in local currency compared to 2023 as we expect consumer demand softness will persist through the remainder of 2024. 
 Combining all of these factors, we expect our 2024 consolidated sales to be approximately flat to 2023. Our guidance excludes the impacts from potential future acquisitions.

 Our sales in the third quarter of 2024 were 902.6 million, or 3.7 percent lower than the third quarter 2023 sales of 937.5 million. Sales in the first nine months of 2024 were 2,905.7 million, or 1.4 percent higher than 2,864.7 million in the same period last year. Compared to the prior year quarter, our net sales decrease was primarily driven by lower sales in China and lower residential and commercial water heater volumes in North America, which more than offset our higher boiler sales, pricing actions, and favorable currency translation of approximately 1 million due to the appreciation of foreign currencies compared to the U.S. dollar. Our net sales increase in the first nine months of 2024 was primarily driven by pricing actions and higher water heater and boiler sales in North America, offset by unfavorable currency translation of approximately 16 million due to the depreciation of foreign currencies compared to the U.S. dollar. Our 2024 and 2023 acquisitions of water treatment companies in North America added approximately 6 million and 14 million of incremental net sales in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively. 
 Our gross profit margin in the third quarter of 2024 was 37.4 percent, a decrease compared to 38.0 percent in the third quarter of 2023. Gross profit margin in the first nine months of 2024 was 38.5 percent compared to the gross profit margin of 38.9 percent in the first nine months of 2023. The lower gross profit margin in the third quarter was primarily due to lower volumes and the associated negative impact on our operational efficiencies compared to the third quarter of 2023. The lower gross profit margin in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to higher production costs, which outpaced our pricing actions. 
 Selling, general, and administrative (SG A) expenses in the third quarter of 2024 increased by 1.7 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. SG A expenses increased 14.9 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the prior year. The increase in SG A expenses in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the prior year periods was primarily due to higher employee costs from increased wages and management incentives in addition to higher selling expenses to support our sales initiatives. 
 Impairment expense in the first nine months of 2023 was 15.6 million related to the sale of our business in Turkey. Of the 15.6 million impairment, 12.5 million was recorded in the Rest of World segment and 3.1 million in Corporate Expense. There was no impairment expense recorded in the first nine months of 2024. 
 Interest expense in the third quarter of 2024 was 1.5 million compared to 2.4 million in the same period last year. Interest expense in the first nine months of 2024 was 4.3 million compared to 10.9 million in the same period the previous year. The decrease in interest expense in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to lower average debt levels. 
 Other expense (income), net was 2.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 essentially flat to the third quarter of 2023. Other expense (income), net was 0.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 10.5) million in the same period last year. The decrease in Other expense (income), net in the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to the absence of non-recurring pension settlement income of 6.0 million realized in the second quarter of 2023, higher foreign currency translation losses and lower interest income.

 Our effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 23.3 percent and 23.7 percent, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 23.2 percent and 24.7 percent, respectively. The change in the effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year quarter was primarily due to a change in geographical earnings mix. The change in the effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period was primarily due to a change in geographical earnings mix and the 15.6 million impairment expense recorded in the prior year period with no associated tax benefit. We estimate that our annual effective income tax rate for the full year of 2024 will be approximately 24 percent. 
 We are providing non-U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) measures (adjusted earnings, adjusted EPS, total segment earnings, adjusted segment earnings, and adjusted corporate expense) that exclude the impact of the 2023 impairment expense and pension settlement income. Reconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the Non-GAAP Measures section below. We believe that the measures of adjusted earnings, adjusted EPS, total segment earnings, adjusted segment earnings, and adjusted corporate expense provide useful information to investors about our performance and allow management and our investors to better understand our performance between periods without regard to items that we do not consider to be a component of our core operating performance. 
 North America Segment 
 (dollars in millions) Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net Sales 703.3 709.9 2,260.3 2,184.9 Segment Earnings 162.5 170.0 559.6 557.7 Segment margin 23.1 23.9 24.8 25.5 
 Sales in our North America segment were 703.3 million in the third quarter of 2024, or 6.6 million lower than sales of 709.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. Sales in the first nine months of 2024 were 2,260.3 million, or 75.4 million higher than sales of 2,184.9 million in the same period last year. Compared to the prior year quarter, our net sales decrease was driven by lower residential and commercial water heater volumes, which more than offset our higher boiler sales and pricing actions. Higher water heater and commercial boiler sales and pricing actions primarily drove our net sales increase in the first nine months of 2024. Our 2024 and 2023 acquisitions of water treatment companies added approximately 6 million and 14 million of incremental net sales in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively. 
 North America segment earnings were 162.5 million in the third quarter of 2024, or 7.5 million lower than segment earnings of 170.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. Segment earnings in the first nine months of 2024 were 559.6 million, an increase of 1.9 million compared to segment earnings of 557.7 million in the first nine months of 2023. Segment margins were 23.1 percent and 23.9 percent in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Segment margins were 24.8 percent and 25.5 percent in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Lower segment earnings and margin in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior year were primarily due to lower volumes of residential and commercial water heaters and higher production costs, which were partially offset by higher commercial boiler volumes. Slightly higher segment earnings in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the prior year period were primarily due to pricing actions, partially offset by higher selling expenses to support our sales growth initiatives. Lower segment margin in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the prior year period was primarily due to higher production costs and higher selling expenses that outpaced our pricing actions. We estimate our 2024 North America segment margin will be approximately 24.5 percent. 
 Adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin in the first nine months of 2023 were 552.7 million and 25.3 percent, respectively. Adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin in the first nine months of 2023 exclude 5.0 million of pension settlement income.

 Rest of World Segment 
 (dollars in millions) Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net Sales 210.3 233.4 682.0 696.7 Segment Earnings 13.6 23.2 56.7 56.8 Segment margin 6.5 9.9 8.3 8.2 
 Sales in the Rest of World segment were 210.3 million in the third quarter of 2024, or 23.1 million lower than sales of 233.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. Sales in the first nine months of 2024 were 682.0 million, or 14.7 million lower than sales of 696.7 million in the same period last year. Compared to the prior year quarter, the net sales decrease was primarily due to lower volumes of our core water heating and water treatment products, partially offset by favorable currency translation of approximately 2 million. Lower net sales in the first nine months of 2024 were primarily driven by the decrease in sales of our core products mentioned above with an incremental approximately 14 million of unfavorable currency translation. The decline in sales in the first nine months of 2024 were partially offset by higher volumes of kitchen products in China and included increased inter-segment sales of approximately 12 million related to our tankless water heaters manufactured in China and shipped to the U.S. market. 
 Rest of World segment earnings were 13.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 and lower compared to 23.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. Segment earnings in the first nine months of 2024 were 56.7 million, essentially flat to the first nine months of 2023. Segment margins were 6.5 percent and 9.9 percent in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Segment margins were 8.3 percent and 8.2 percent in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Lower volumes of our core water heating and water treatment products primarily drove lower segment earnings and segment margin in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Essentially flat segment earnings and segment margin in the first nine months of 2024 were primarily driven by lower volumes of our core water heating and water treatment products and an unfavorable product mix and sales promotions in China, offset by the absence of the nonrecurring impairment expense of 12.5 million associated with the sale of our business in Turkey recorded in the first quarter of 2023. We estimate our 2024 Rest of World segment margin will be approximately eight percent. 
 Adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin in the first nine months of 2023 were 69.3 million and 9.9 percent, respectively. Adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin in the first nine months of 2023 exclude the 12.5 million of impairment expense. 
 
 Outlook 
 We expect our consolidated sales in 2024 to be flat to 2023. Our sales projection is driven by expected flat industry residential and commercial unit water heater volumes in North America compared to the prior year. We expect to see an eight percent increase in our sales of boilers in 2024 compared to 2023 as we continue to benefit from the transition to higher-efficiency boilers. We anticipate sales of our North America water treatment products will increase by approximately eight to ten percent in 2024, compared to 2023, as we continue our geographic expansion. In our Rest of the World segment, we expect sales in China to decrease six to eight percent in local currency compared to 2023, driven by expected softness in consumer demand. We expect to achieve full-year earnings of between 3.70 and 3.85 per share. Our guidance excludes the impacts from potential future acquisitions. 
 
 Liquidity Capital Resources 
 Our working capital was 568.3 million at September 30, 2024, compared with 555.0 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in working capital was primarily related to higher inventory balances, lower accounts payable and lower payroll-related accruals, partially offset by lower cash and receivable balances. As of September 30, 2024, cash balances were negatively impacted by 1.7 million due to changes in foreign currency during the year. Cash and cash equivalents used to fund our operations are primarily generated through operating activities and our existing credit facilities. We believe our available cash and existing credit facilities are sufficient to cover our cash needs for the foreseeable future. We use a global cash pooling arrangement, intercompany borrowing, and some local credit lines to meet funding needs and allocate capital resources among various entities. We have historically made and anticipate future cash repatriations from certain foreign subsidiaries. In the first nine months of 2024, we repatriated approximately 88 million of cash from our foreign subsidiaries and used the proceeds to pay down outstanding debt balances and fund an acquisition.

 (dollars in millions) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Cash provided by operating activities 359.9 439.0 Cash used in investing activities (111.1) (30.8) Cash used in financing activities (367.7) (500.7) 
 Cash provided by operations in the first nine months of 2024 was 359.9 million and lower than 439.0 million in the first nine months of 2023, primarily as a result of higher incentive payments associated with record sales and profits earned in 2023 and higher inventory balances, which more than offset lower trade receivable balances. Our free cash flow in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 was 282.5 million and 396.3 million, respectively. We expect cash provided by operating activities to be approximately 525 million in 2024. We expect free cash flow to be approximately 415 million in 2024. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure described in more detail in the Non-GAAP Measures section below. 
 Capital expenditures totaled 77.4 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared with 42.7 million in the same period last year. Higher capital expenditures compared to the prior year period was primarily due to our capacity expansion projects. We project 2024 capital expenditures will be between 105 million and 115 million and full-year depreciation and amortization expense will be approximately 80 million. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we renewed and amended our 500 million revolving credit facility ("renewed facility") which now expires on August 23, 2029. The renewed facility is with a group of nine banks and has an accordion provision that allows it to be increased up to 1 billion if certain conditions (including lender approval) are satisfied, which is an increase of 150 million from the amount prior to the renewal and amendment. Borrowing rates under the renewed facility are determined by our leverage ratio. The renewed facility requires us to maintain two financial covenants, a leverage ratio test and an interest coverage test, and we were in compliance with the covenants as of September 30, 2024, and expect to be in compliance for the foreseeable future. The renewed facility backs up commercial paper and credit line borrowings. At September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding under the renewed facility and an available borrowing capacity of 500.0 million. We believe the combination of available borrowing capacity and operating cash flows will provide sufficient funds to finance our existing operations for the foreseeable future. 
 Our total debt decreased by 7.6 million in the first nine months of 2024 as we used available cash to pay down outstanding debt balances. Our leverage, as measured by the ratio of total debt to total capitalization, was 5.9 percent at September 30, 2024, compared with 6.5 percent at December 31, 2023. 
 In the first quarter of 2024, our Board of Directors approved adding 2,000,000 shares of common stock to our existing discretionary share repurchase authority. Under our share repurchase program, we may purchase our common stock through a combination of a Rule 10b5-1 automatic trading plan and discretionary purchases in accordance with applicable securities laws. The stock repurchase authorization remains effective until terminated by our Board of Directors, which may occur at any time, subject to the parameters of any Rule 10b5-1 automatic trading plan that we may then have in effect. During the first nine months of 2024, we repurchased 2,850,500 shares of our stock at a total cost of 237.1 million. At September 30, 2024, we had 2,650,962 shares remaining on the share repurchase authority. Depending on factors such as stock price, working capital requirements, and alternative investment opportunities, we expect to spend approximately 300 million on stock repurchases in 2024 through a combination of any renewed Rule 10b5-1 automatic trading plan and open market repurchases. 
 On October 7, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 0.34 per share on our Common Stock and Class A common stock. The dividend is payable on November 15, 2024, to shareholders of record on October 31, 2024.

 Non-GAAP Financial Information 
 We provide non-GAAP measures of free cash flow, adjusted earnings, adjusted EPS, total segment earnings, adjusted segment earnings, and adjusted corporate expense. We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Our adjusted earnings, adjusted EPS, adjusted segment earnings, and adjusted corporate expenses exclude the impact of the 2023 impairment expense and pension settlement income. 
 We believe that free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements. We believe that the measure of adjusted earnings, adjusted EPS, adjusted segment earnings and adjusted corporate expense provides useful information to investors about our performance and allows management and our investors to better understand our performance between periods without regard to items we do not consider to be a component of our core operating performance.

 Critical Accounting Policies 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which requires the use of estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. The critical accounting policies that we believe could have the most significant effect on our reported results or require complex judgment by management are contained in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. We believe that at September 30, 2024, there was no material change to this information.

 Forward Looking Statements 
 This filing contains statements that the Company believes are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of words such as may, will, expect, intend, estimate, anticipate, believe, forecast, continue, guidance, outlook or words of similar meaning. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated as of the date of this filing. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these expectations include, among other things, the following: further softening in U.S. residential and commercial water heater demand; negative impacts to the Company, particularly the demand for its products, resulting from global inflationary pressures or a potential recession in one or more of the markets in which the Company participates; the Company s ability to continue to obtain commodities, components, parts and accessories on a timely basis through its supply chain and at expected costs; negative impacts to demand for the Company s products, particularly commercial products, as a result of changes in commercial property usage that followed the COVID-19 pandemic; further weakening in North American residential or commercial construction or instability in the Company's replacement markets; inability of the Company to implement or maintain pricing actions; inconsistent recovery of the Chinese economy or a further decline in the growth rate of consumer spending or housing sales in China; the availability, timing or effects of China stimulus programs; negative impact to the Company s businesses from international tariffs, trade disputes and geopolitical differences, including the conflicts in Ukraine, the Middle East and attacks on commercial shipping vessels in the Red Sea; potential further weakening in the high-efficiency gas boiler segment in the U.S.; substantial defaults in payment by, material reduction in purchases by or the loss, bankruptcy or insolvency of a major customer; foreign currency fluctuations; the Company s inability to successfully integrate or achieve its strategic objectives resulting from acquisitions; the possibility that the parties will fail to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to satisfy any of the other conditions to the proposed acquisition; failure to realize the expected benefits of acquisitions or expected synergies; failure to realize the expected benefits, timing and extent, of regulatory changes; competitive pressures on the Company s businesses; including new technologies and new competitors; the impact of potential information technology or data security breaches; negative impact of changes in government regulations or regulatory requirements; the inability to respond to secular trends toward decarbonization and energy efficiency and adverse developments in general economic, political and business conditions in key regions of the world. A more detailed description of these risks is contained under the heading "Risk Factors" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Forward-looking statements included in this filing are made only as of the date of this filing, and the Company is under no obligation to update these statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.

 ITEM 3 - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 As is more fully described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, we are exposed to various types of market risks, including currency and certain commodity risks. Our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk have not materially changed since that report was filed. We monitor our currency and commodity risks on a continuous basis and generally enter into forward and futures contracts to minimize these exposures. The majority of the contracts are for periods of less than one year. Our Company does not engage in speculation in our derivative strategies. It is important to note that gains and losses from our forward and futures contract activities are offset by changes in the underlying costs of the transactions being hedged.

 ITEM 4 - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). Based upon this evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.

 ITEM 2 - UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES, USE OF PROCEEDS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 
 In the first quarter of 2024, our Board of Directors approved adding 2,000,000 shares of common stock to the existing discretionary share repurchase authority. Under the share repurchase program, the Common Stock may be purchased through a combination of Rule 10b5-1 automatic trading plan and discretionary purchases in accordance with applicable securities laws. The number of shares purchased and the timing of the purchases will depend on a number of factors, including share price, trading volume and general market conditions, as well as working capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors, including alternative investment opportunities. The stock repurchase authorization remains effective until terminated by our Board of Directors which may occur at any time, subject to the parameters of any Rule 10b5-1 automatic trading plan that we may then have in effect. In the third quarter of 2024, we repurchased 1,016,500 shares at an average price of 82.63 per share and at a total cost of 84.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, there were 2,650,962 shares remaining on the existing repurchase authorization.

Unless otherwise directed by the L C Issuer, the Company shall not be required to make a specific request to the L C Issuer for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the L C Issuer to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date (unless the Company Cash Collateralizes such Letter of Credit on or prior to the Letter of Credit Expiration Date) provided that the L C Issuer shall not permit any such extension if (A) the L C Issuer has determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation, at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of Section 2.7.1(b) or 2.7.1(c) or otherwise) or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is five Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date (1) from the Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (2) from any Lender, the Administrative Agent or any Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.2 is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing the L C Issuer not to permit such extension. 
 4.

Unless otherwise directed by the L C Issuer, the Company shall not be required to make a specific request to the L C Issuer to permit such reinstatement. Once an Auto-Reinstatement Letter of Credit has been issued, except as provided in the following sentence, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the L C Issuer to reinstate all or a portion of the stated amount thereof in accordance with the provisions of such Letter of Credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such Auto-Reinstatement Letter of Credit permits the L C Issuer to decline to reinstate all or any portion of the stated amount thereof after a drawing thereunder by giving notice of such non-reinstatement within a specified number of days after such drawing (the Non-Reinstatement Deadline ), the L C Issuer shall not permit such reinstatement if it has received a notice (which shall be in writing) on or before the day that is ten Business Days before the Non-Reinstatement Deadline (A) from the Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such reinstatement or (B) from any Lender, the Administrative Agent or any Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.2 is not then satisfied (treating such reinstatement as an L C Credit Extension for purposes of this subsection (c) and, in each case, directing the L C Issuer not to permit such reinstatement.

If the Company receives notice of a drawing under a Letter of Credit at or after 10 00 a.m. (Milwaukee time) on the Honor Date, the Company may make such reimbursement on the immediately following Business Day (and interest on the amount so paid by the L C Issuer shall accrue for the account of the L C Issuer from the Honor Date to such immediately following Business Day at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate (or such other rate as the Company and the L C Issuer shall agree)). If the Company fails to reimburse the L C Issuer for the full amount of any drawing under any Letter of Credit by 12 00 noon (Milwaukee time) on the date required pursuant to the two preceding sentences, the L C Issuer will promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender thereof, and the Company shall be deemed to have requested that Base Rate Loans be made by the Lenders to be disbursed on such date in payment of the unpaid reimbursement obligations with respect to such Letter of Credit (the Unreimbursed Amount ), subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Aggregate Commitment and subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.2 , other than any notice requirement and without regard to any requirement that Borrowings be in a particular amount. Any notice given by the L C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this subsection 2.7.3(a) may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice. 
 2. Each Lender (including the Lender acting as L C Issuer) shall upon any notice pursuant to subsection 2.7.3(a) make funds available in U.S. Dollars or Dollar Equivalent, as applicable, to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L C Issuer at the Administrative Agent s Office in an amount equal to its Total Pro Rata Share of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 12 00 noon (Milwaukee time) on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of subsection 2.7.3(c) , each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the Company in such amount.

 3. With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans because the conditions set forth in Section 4.2 
 53 

cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Company shall be deemed to have incurred from the L C Issuer an L C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In such event, each Lender s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L C Issuer pursuant to subsection 2.7.3(b) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L C Borrowing and shall constitute an L C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.7 . 
 4. Until each Lender funds its Loan or L C Advance pursuant to this subsection 2.7.3 to reimburse the L C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender s Total Pro Rata Share of such amount shall be solely for the account of the L C Issuer. 
 5. Each Lender s obligation to make Loans or L C Advances to reimburse the L C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this subsection 2.7.3 , shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the L C Issuer, the Company or any other Person for any reason whatsoever (B) the occurrence or continuance of an Event of Default or an Unmatured Event of Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing provided that each Lender s obligation to make Loans pursuant to this subsection 2.7.3 is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.2 (other than delivery by the Company of a Notice of Borrowing). No such making of an L C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Company to reimburse the L C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by the L C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein. 
 6. If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this subsection 2.7.3 by the time specified in subsection 2.7.3(b) , the L C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the L C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. A certificate of the L C Issuer submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
 iv. Repayment of Participations . 
 1. At any time after the L C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Lender such Lender s L C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with subsection 2.7.3 , if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of the L C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the Company or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender its Total Pro Rata Share thereof (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, 
 54 

to reflect the period of time during which such Lender s L C Advance was outstanding) in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent. 
 2. If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the L C Issuer pursuant to subsection 2.7.3 is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 11.6 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the L C Issuer in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L C Issuer its Total Pro Rata Share thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. 
 v. Obligations Absolute . The obligation of the Company to reimburse the L C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to repay each L C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following

 55 

6. any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Company. 
 The Company shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with the Company s instructions or other irregularity, the Company will promptly notify the L C Issuer.

None of the L C Issuer, any Agent-Related Person nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of the L C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Required Lenders (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or L C Application. The Company hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit provided that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Company s pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at Law or under any other agreement. None of the L C Issuer, any Agent-Related Person, or any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of the L C Issuer shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (a) through (e) of subsection 2.7.5 provided that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company may have a claim against the L C Issuer, and the L C Issuer may be liable to the Company, to the extent such damages are determined in a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the L C Issuer s willful misconduct or gross negligence or the L C Issuer s wrongful dishonor of any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the L C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and the L C Issuer shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason. 
 vii. Cash Collateral .

 56 

resulted in an L C Borrowing, or (ii) if, as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any Letter of Credit for any reason remains outstanding and partially or wholly undrawn, the Company shall immediately Cash Collateralize the then Effective Amount of all L C Obligations (in an amount equal to such Effective Amount determined as of the date of such L C Borrowing or the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, as the case may be). The Company hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for its own benefit and for the benefit of the L C Issuer and the Lenders, a Lien on all such cash and deposit account balances described in the definition of Cash Collateralize as security for the L C Obligations. Cash Collateral shall be maintained in blocked, interest bearing deposit accounts at BMO or in accordance with other arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, which accounts, in any case, are the subject of control agreements pursuant to which the Administrative Agent has control as such term is used in the Uniform Commercial Code, sufficient to perfect a security interest in such cash collateral. The Lien held by the Administrative Agent in such Cash Collateral to secure the L C Obligations shall be released upon the satisfaction of each of the following conditions (1) no Letters of Credit shall be outstanding, (2) all L C Obligations shall have been repaid in full and (3) no Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. The Administrative Agent also may require the Company to immediately Cash Collateralize the L C Obligations in an amount equal to the then Effective Amount thereof if any Event of Default occurs and is continuing, as provided in Section 8.2(c) . If at any time the amount of Cash Collateral exceeds 102 of the then Effective Amount of all L C Obligations, and provided that no Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, at the Company s request, the Administrative Agent shall release Cash Collateral in an amount equal to such excess, and its Lien thereon, to the Company.

The Deteriorating Lender hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L C Issuer, a security interest in all such Cash Collateral and all proceeds of the foregoing. If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that any Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent (and such Deteriorating Lender) or that the total amount thereof is less than such Deteriorating Lender s Total Pro Rata Share of the then Effective Amount of all L C Obligations, the Deteriorating Lender will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or deliver to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount equal to the excess of (x) such Deteriorating Lender s Total Pro Rata Share of the then Effective Amount of all L C Obligations over (y) the total amount of Cash Collateral that the Administrative Agent determines to be free and clear of any such right or claim. Upon the drawing of any Cash Collateral, such funds shall be applied, to the extent permitted under applicable Governmental Rules, to reimburse the L C Issuer solely to the extent the Company otherwise fails to satisfy its obligation to reimburse the L C Issuer in respect of such drawing provided such Cash Collateral will be released back to the Deteriorating Lender when and to the extent such Deteriorating Lender s obligations are reduced or eliminated, 
 57 

whether as a result of an assignment of such Deteriorating Lender s Commitment, or a reduction in or termination of such Letters of Credit, or such Lender ceases to be a Deteriorating Lender or otherwise.

 x. Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to L C Issuer . The Company shall pay directly to the L C Issuer for its own account a fronting fee with respect to each Letter of Credit in the amount specified in the BMO Fee Letter, payable on the average daily maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit during the applicable fiscal quarter. Such fronting fee shall be (i) computed on a quarterly basis in arrears and (ii) due and payable on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand (unless Cash Collateralized, in which case, Letter of Credit Fees shall continue to be due and payable on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter).

To the extent lawful, the interest and charges that would have been paid in respect of such Loan but were not paid as a result of the operation of this Section 2.13(h) shall be cumulated and the interest and charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not above the amount collectible at the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate for each day to the date of repayment, has been received by such Lender. 
 9. If any provision of this Agreement or of any of the other Loan Documents would obligate the Canadian Borrower to make any payment of interest or other amount payable to any Lender in an amount or calculated at a rate which would be prohibited by applicable Law or would result in a receipt by such Lender of interest at a criminal rate (as such terms are construed under the Criminal Code (Canada)) then, notwithstanding such provisions, such amount or rate shall be deemed to have been adjusted with retroactive effect to the maximum amount or rate of interest, as the case may be, that would not be prohibited by applicable Law or otherwise result in receipt by such Lender of interest at a criminal rate, such adjustment to be effected, to the extent necessary, as follows firstly, by reducing the amount or rate of interest required to be paid to such Lender under the applicable Loan Document, and thereafter, by reducing any fees, commissions, premiums and other amounts required to be paid to such Lender that would constitute interest for purposes of Section 347 of the Criminal Code (Canada). For the purposes of this Agreement, the effective annual rate of interest shall be determined in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices and principles over the 
 64 

relevant term and, in the event of dispute, a certificate of a Fellow of the Canadian Institute of Actuaries appointed by the Administrative Agent will be prima facie evidence of such rate. 
 10. For the purpose of the Interest Act (Canada) and any other purpose, (i) the principle of deemed reinvestment of interest shall not apply to any calculation under this Agreement, (ii) where interest is calculated pursuant hereto at a rate based upon a 365 366 or 360 day year (the First Rate ), it is hereby agreed that the rate or percentage of interest on a yearly basis is equivalent to such First Rate multiplied by the actual number of days in the year divided by 365 366 or 360, as applicable, and (c) the rates of interest and fees stipulated in this Agreement are intended to be nominal rates and effective rates or yields.

 66 

4. Unless the Administrative Agent receives notice from the Company or the Dutch Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders that the Company or the Dutch Borrower will not make such payment in full as and when required, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Company or the Dutch Borrower, as applicable, has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date in immediately available funds and the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender.

 2. If and to the extent any Lender shall not have made its full amount of any Loan available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds on a Borrowing Date and the Administrative Agent in such circumstances has made available to the applicable Borrower such amount, such Lender shall on the Business Day following such Borrowing Date make such amount available to the Administrative Agent, together with interest 
 67

 3. A notice of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to amounts owing under subsection (b) above shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

If any Lender shall obtain any payment or other recovery (whether voluntary, involuntary, by application of setoff or otherwise) on account of any Loan made by it, or the participations in L C Obligations or in Swing Line Loans held by it (other than pursuant to the terms of Sections 3.1 , 3.3 or 3.4 in excess of its Total Pro Rata Share of payments then or therewith obtained by the other Lenders, such Lender shall purchase from the other Lenders such participations (or subparticipations) in Loans, Swing Line Loans or L C Obligations, as applicable, held by such other Lenders as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment or other recovery ratably with each other Lender provided that if all or any portion of the excess payment or other recovery is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, the purchase shall be rescinded and each Lender that has sold a participation to such purchasing Lender shall repay to such purchasing Lender the purchase price to the ratable extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such selling Lender s ratable share (according to the proportion of (a) the amount of such selling Lender s required repayment to such purchasing Lender to (b) the total amount so recovered from such purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by such purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrowers agree that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section may, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, exercise all its rights of payment (including pursuant to Section 11.10 with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the applicable Borrower in the amount of such participation. If under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any Lender receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this Section applies, such Lender shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Lenders entitled under this Section to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim. The Lenders may, without the consent of any Borrower or any other Person, make arrangements among themselves to amend or otherwise modify this Section 2.18 to establish different sharing arrangements with respect to payments by

All or any part of such Defaulting Lender s participation in L C Obligations and Swing Line Loans shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Total Pro Rata Shares (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender s Commitment) but only to the extent that such reallocation does not cause the aggregate credit exposure and outstanding Loans hereunder of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender s Commitment. Subject to Section 11.21 , no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non- 
 74 

Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender s increased exposure following such reallocation.

If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent and the L C Issuer as herein provided, or that the 
 75 

total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the Minimum Collateral Amount, the Company shall, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency (after giving effect to any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender). If at any time the total amount of such Cash Collateral is greater than the Minimum Collateral Amount, the Administrative Agent will, promptly upon demand by the Company, release to the Company Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such excess. 
 b. Application . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under this Section 2.23 in respect of Letters of Credit shall be applied to the satisfaction of the Defaulting Lender s obligation to fund participations in respect of L C Obligations (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, before any other application of such property otherwise provided for herein.

 80 

2. If a Lender determines that it is unlawful to maintain any Term Benchmark Loan (other than a CORRA Rate Loan) or Daily Term SOFR Loans, the Company shall, upon its receipt of notice of such fact and demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay, or cause the Dutch Borrower or Canadian Borrower to prepay, in full such Term Benchmark Loan or Daily Term SOFR Loans, together with interest accrued thereon and amounts required under Section 3.4 , either on the last day of the Interest Period thereof or, if earlier, on the date on which such Lender may no longer lawfully continue to maintain such Term Benchmark Loan or Daily Term SOFR Loans.

If the obligation of any Lender to make or maintain CORRA Rate Loans has been so terminated or suspended, such Lender shall not be required to make or continue any further CORRA Rate Loans until such termination or suspension, as applicable, ceases, and all outstanding CORRA Rate Loans that are not continued shall be repaid in full when due. 
 4. Before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent or demand upon the Company under this Section, the Affected Lender shall designate a different Lending Office with respect to its Term Benchmark Loans or Daily Term SOFR Loans, as applicable, if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice or making such demand and will not, in the judgment of such Lender, be illegal or otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. 
 (c) Increased Costs and Reduction of Return . 
 1.

Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall make a demand for payment under this subsection 3.3(a) unless it also makes a demand for payment for increased costs to similarly situated borrowers party to a credit facility with the Administrative Agent or such Lender. 
 2. If after the Fourth Amendment Effective Date any Lender shall have determined that (i) the introduction of any Capital Adequacy Regulation, (ii) any change in any Capital Adequacy Regulation, (iii) any change in the interpretation or administration of any Capital Adequacy Regulation by any central bank or other Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, (iv) compliance by such Lender (or its Lending Office) or any Person controlling such Lender with any Capital Adequacy Regulation (excluding, in each of the foregoing cases, any change that is merely proposed and not binding) or (v) any Change of Law, affects or would affect the amount of capital or liquidity required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or such controlling Person and (taking into consideration such Lender s or such controlling Person s policies with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity and such Lender s or such controlling Person s desired return on capital) determines that the amount of such capital or liquidity is increased as a consequence of its Commitment, its Credit Extensions (or participations therein) or its obligations under this Agreement, then, within 30 days after demand of such Lender to the applicable Borrower through the Administrative Agent, such Borrower shall pay to such Lender, from time to time as specified by such Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increase. No Lender shall make a demand for payment under this subsection 3.3(b) unless it also makes a demand for payment for an increase in the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or such controlling Person to similarly situated borrowers party to a credit facility with such Lender.

 88 

obligation of the Company to make any payment demanded by such Lender in accordance with Section 3.3 .

who has received funds on behalf of a Lender or L C Issuer, to the rights and interests of such Lender or L C Issuer) under the Loan Documents with respect to such amount (the Erroneous Payment Subrogation Rights (provided that the Borrowers Obligations under the Loan Documents in respect of the Erroneous Payment Subrogation Rights shall not be duplicative of such Obligations in respect of Loans that have been assigned to the Administrative Agent under an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment) and (y) an Erroneous Payment shall not pay, prepay, repay, discharge or otherwise satisfy any Obligations owed by the Borrowers provided that this Section 9.11 shall not be interpreted to increase (or accelerate the due date for), or have the effect of increasing (or accelerating the due date for), the Obligations of the Borrowers relative to the amount (and or timing for payment) of the Obligations that would have been payable had such Erroneous Payment not been made by the Administrative Agent provided, further, that for the avoidance of doubt, immediately preceding clauses (x) and (y) shall not apply to the extent any such Erroneous Payment is, and solely with respect to the amount of such Erroneous Payment that is, comprised of funds received by the Administrative Agent from the Borrowers for the purpose of making such Erroneous Payment.
