 as of November 1, 2024, November 3, 2023, and February 2, 2024. The Company s measurements of fair value of the contingent consideration are based on an income approach, which requires certain assumptions considering operating performance of the business and a risk-adjusted discount rate.

 Assets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
 
 During the three and nine months ended November 1, 2024, and November 3, 2023, the Company had no material measurements of assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis subsequent to their initial recognition. 
 
 Other Fair Value Disclosures 
 
 The Company s financial assets and liabilities not measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, short-term borrowings, accounts payable, and long-term debt and are reflected in the financial statements at cost. With the exception of long-term debt, cost approximates fair value for these items due to their short-term nature. As further described in Note 7 , certain long-term debt is associated with a fair value hedge and the changes in fair value of the hedged debt is included in the carrying value of long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets. The fair values of the Company s unsecured notes were estimated using quoted market prices. The fair values of the Company s mortgage notes were estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on the future cash outflows associated with these arrangements and discounted using the applicable incremental borrowing rate.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Lowe s Companies, Inc. 
 
 Results of Review of Interim Financial Information 
 
 We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Lowe s Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company as of November 1, 2024 and November 3, 2023, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, and shareholders deficit for the fiscal three-month and nine-month periods ended November 1, 2024 and November 3, 2023, and cash flows for the fiscal nine-month periods ended November 1, 2024 and November 3, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the interim financial information ). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of February 2, 2024, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, shareholders deficit, and cash flows for the fiscal year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated March 25, 2024, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of February 2, 2024, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. 
 
 Basis for Review Results 
 
 This interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our review in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 This discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results, liquidity and capital resources during the three and nine months ended November 1, 2024, and November 3, 2023. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements that are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2024 (the Annual Report), as well as the consolidated financial statements (unaudited) and notes to the consolidated financial statements (unaudited) contained in this report. Unless otherwise specified, all comparisons made are to the corresponding period of fiscal 2023. This discussion and analysis is presented in four sections:

 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
 
 The following table highlights our financial results: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended (in millions, except per share data) 
 November 1, 2024 November 3, 2023 November 1, 2024 November 3, 2023 Net sales 
 20,170 20,471 65,120 67,775 Net earnings 
 1,695 1,773 5,833 6,706 Diluted earnings per share 
 2.99 3.06 10.22 11.40 Net cash provided by operating activities 
 8,714 7,032 Capital expenditures 
 1,379 1,344 Repurchases of common stock 1 
 2,515 5,930 Cash dividend payments 
 1,916 1,899 
 1 Repurchases of common stock on a trade-date basis. 
 
 Net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 decline d 1.5 to 20.2 billion compared to net sales of 20.5 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Comparable sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased 1.1 , consisting of a 1.3 decrease in comparable customer transactions, partially offset by an increase of 0.2 in comparable average ticket. Net earnings in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 were 1.7 billion, compared to net earnings of 1.8 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Diluted earnings per common share were 2.99 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 3.06 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Included in the third quarter of 2024 results was pre-tax income of 54 million consisting of a realized gain on the contingent consideration associated with the fiscal 2022 sale of the Canadian retail business, which increased diluted earnings per common share by 0.10. Excluding the impact of this item, adjusted diluted earnings per common share was 2.89 in the third quarter of 2024 (see the non-GAAP financial measures discussion). 
 
 For the first nine months of fiscal 2024, cash flows from operating activities were approximately 8.7 billion, with 1.4 billion used for capital expenditures. Continuing to deliver on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, during the three months ended November 1, 2024, we repurchased 758 million of common stock and paid 654 million in dividends. 
 
 Third quarter fiscal 2024 comparable sales declined 1.1 driven by continued softness in Do-It-Y ourself (DIY) demand, partially offset by storm-related sales and continued strength with our Pro customers and online. Growth with our Pro customers is driven by the investments we have made to better serve the small-to-medium sized Pro as part of our Total Home strategy. In addition, investments in our supply chain and Pro job site delivery enabled us to quickly mobilize essential supplies to those areas impacted by the recent hurricanes Helene and Milton. 
 
 Our continued disciplined expense management across the Company has enabled us to deliver strong operating performance during a challenging economic setting. W hile the near-term macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, the core medium-to-long-term drivers of our business are strong: home price appreciation, disposable personal income, and aging housing stock. We believe these drivers, along with Millennial household formation and Baby Boomers aging in place, support demand over the long-term, particularly as interest rate pressure begins to ea se. In the meantime, we plan to continue investing in our Total

 1 A comparable location is defined as a retail location that has been open longer than 13 months. A location that is identified for relocation is no longer considered comparable in the month of its relocation. The relocated location must then remain open longer than 13 months to be considered comparable. A location we decide to close is no longer considered comparable as of the beginning of the month in which we announce its closing. Operating locations which are sold are included in comparable sales until the date of sale. Comparable sales are presented on a transacted basis when tender is accepted from a customer. Comparable sales include online sales, which impacted third quarter fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 comparable sales by approximately 55 basis points a nd -40 basis points, respectively, and year-to-date fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 sales by approximately 35 basis points and 30 basis points, respectively. The com parable store sales calculation included in the preceding table was calculated using comparable 13-week and 39-week periods. 
 2 Average ticket is defined as net sales divided by the total number of customer transactions. 
 3 Average store size selling square feet is defined as sales floor square feet divided by the number of stores open at the end of the period.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share 
 
 Adjusted diluted earnings per share is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful insight for analysts and investors in understanding the comparison of operational performance for fiscal 2024. Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the impact of a certain item, further described below, not contemplated in the Company s business outlook for fiscal 2024. There were no non-GAAP adjustments to diluted earnings per share for the three months ended November 3, 2023. 
 
 Fiscal 2024 Impacts 
 In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company recognized pre-tax income of 54 million consisting of a realized gain on the contingent consideration associated with the fiscal 2022 sale of the Canadian retail business (Canadian retail business transaction). 
 
 Adjusted diluted earnings per share should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful indicator of, the Company s diluted earnings per common share as prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company s methods of determining non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the method used by other companies and may not be comparable.

 1 Represents the corresponding tax benefit or expense specifically related to the item excluded from adjusted diluted earnings per share. 

Return on Invested Capital 
 
 Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is calculated using a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes ROIC is a meaningful metric for analysts and investors as a measure of how effectively the Company is using capital to generate financial returns. Although ROIC is a common financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating ROIC. Accordingly, the method used by our management may differ from the methods used by other companies. We encourage you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate ROIC before comparing its ROIC to ours. 
 
 We define ROIC as the rolling 12 months lease adjusted net operating profit after tax (Lease adjusted NOPAT) divided by the average of current year and prior year ending debt and shareholders deficit. Lease adjusted NOPAT is a non-GAAP financial measure, and net earnings is considered to be the most comparable GAAP financial measure. The calculation of ROIC, together with a reconciliation of net earnings to Lease adjusted NOPAT, is as follows:

Results of Operations 
 
 Net Sales Net sales in the third quarter of 2024 decreased 1.5 to 20.2 billion. Comparable sales declined 1.1 , consisting of a 1.3 decline in comparable customer transactions, partially offset by a 0.2 increase in co mparable average ticket. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we experienced growth in Building Materials, Hardware, and Seasonal Outdoor Living, as well as performance above company average in Paint, which reflect continued strong demand with the Pro customer and online, along with storm-related demand lift. 
 
 Net sales in the first nine months of 2024 decreased 3.9 to 65.1 billion . Comparable sales also declined 3.6 over the same period, driven by a 3.6 d ecline in comparable customer transactions, while comparable average ticket was flat. 
 
 Gross Margin For the third quarter of 2024 , gross margin as a percentage of sales increased three basis points. G ross margin rate benefited from ongoing productivity initiatives, partially offset by investments in our supply chain and storm-related product mix and damages. 
 
 For the first nine months of 2024, gross margin as a percentage of sales contracted 22 basis points, primarily due to ongoing investments in our supply chain and a decline in credit revenue, partially offset by lower transportation costs. 
 
 SG A For the third quarter of 2024, SG A expen se deleveraged 60 basis points as a pe rcentage of sales compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to employee compensation benefits, advertising, and incremental direct storm-related costs, partially offset by the current year gain on contingent consideration associated with the fiscal 2022 sale of the Canadian retail business. 
 
 For the first nine months of 2024, SG A expense as a percentage of sales deleveraged 99 basis points as a percentage of sales, primarily due to the same factors that impacted SG A for the third quarter, in addition to the cycling of prior year favorable legal settlements. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization deleveraged three basis points as a percentage of sales for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023.

Table of Contents 

For the firs t nine months of 2024, depreciation and amorti zation deleveraged nine basis points as a percentage of sales. 
 
 Interest Net Net interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 leveraged 11 basis points as a percentage of sales. 
 
 Net interest expense for the first nine months of 2024 leveraged one basis point as a percentage of sales. 
 
 Income Tax Provision Our effective income tax rates were 23.6 and 24.6 for the three months ended November 1, 2024 and November 3, 2023, respectively, and 23.8 and 24.1 for the nine months ended November 1, 2024 and November 3, 2023, respectively. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 
 Cash flows from operations, combined with our continued access to capital markets on both a short-term and long-term basis, as needed, remain adequate to fund our operations, make strategic investments to support long-term growth, return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, and repay debt maturities as they become due. We believe these sources of liquidity will continue to support our business for the next twelve months. As of November 1, 2024, we held 3.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents, as well as 4.0 billion in undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facilities. 
 
 Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities Nine Months Ended (In millions) November 1, 2024 November 3, 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 8,714 7,032 
 
 Cash flows from operating activities continued to provide the primary source of our liquidity. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended November 1, 2024, compared to the nine months ended November 3, 2023, was primarily driven by timing of prior year income tax payments and other changes in working capital, partially offset by lower net earnings. Cash flows relating to changes in other operating liabilities improved 1.7 billion driven by the first quarter of fiscal 2023 payment of our third and fourth quarter fiscal 2022 estimated federal tax payments that were deferred under the income tax relief announced by the IRS for businesses located in states impacted by Hurricane Ian. In addition, net cash flows relating to changes in inventory and accounts payable increased 880 million primar ily due to a timing shift of purchases relative to the prior year period. 
 
 Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities Nine Months Ended (In millions) November 1, 2024 November 3, 2023 Net cash used in investing activities (1,320) (1,306) 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities primarily consists of transactions related to capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures generally consist of investments in our strategic initiatives and technology to enhance our ability to serve customers, improve existing stores, and support expansion plans. Capital expenditures w ere 1.4 billion and 1.3 billion for the nine months ended November 1, 2024, and November 3, 2023, respectively. For fiscal 2024, our guidance for capital expenditures is approximately 2.0 billion. 
 
 Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities Nine Months Ended (In millions) November 1, 2024 November 3, 2023 Net cash used in financing activities (5,044) (5,864) 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities primarily consists of transactions related to our debt, share repurchases, and cash dividend payments.

There were no outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program, 2023 Credit Agreement, or the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement as of November 1, 2024. Total combined availability under the 2023 Credit Agreement and the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement as of November 1, 2024, was 4.0 billion. 
 
 The 2023 Credit Agreement and the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contain customary representations, warranties, and covenants. We were in compliance with those covenants at November 1, 2024.

 Share Repurchases 
 
 We have an ongoing share repurchase program, authorized by the Company s Board of Directors, that is executed through purchases made from time to time either in the open market or through private off-market transactions. We also withhold shares from employees to satisfy tax withholding liabilities. Shares repurchased are retired and returned to authorized and unissued status. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the total number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share, and the total cash used to repurchase shares for the nine months ended November 1, 2024, and November 3, 2023: 
 Nine Months Ended (In millions, except per share data) November 1, 2024 November 3, 2023 Total amount paid for share repurchases 1

 1 Excludes unsettled share repurchases and unpaid excise taxes. 
 
 As of November 1, 2024, we had 12.2 billion re maining available under our share repurchase program with no expiration date. The Company determines the timing and amount of repurchases based on its assessment of various factors including prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity, and the economic environment, among others. The timing and amount of these share repurchases are subject to change at any time. 
 
 Dividends 
 
 Dividends are paid in the quarter immediately following the quarter in which they are declared. Dividends paid per share increased from 3.20 per share for the nine months ended November 3, 2023, to 3.35 per share for the nine months ended November 1, 2024. 
 
 Capital Resources 
 
 We expect to continue to have access to the capital markets on both a short-term and long-term basis when needed for liquidity purposes. The availability and the borrowing costs of these funds could be adversely affected, however, by a downgrade of our debt ratings or a deterioration of certain financial ratios. The table below reflects our debt ratings by Standard Poor s (S P) and Moody s as of November 27, 2024, which we are disclosing to enhance understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effect of our ratings on our cost of funds.

 The Company is undergoing a multi-year technology transformation which includes updating and modernizing our merchandise selling system, as well as certain accounting and finance systems. These updates are expected to continue for the next few years, and management will continue to evaluate the design and implementation of the Company s internal controls over financial reporting as the transformation continues. No change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended November 1, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 3.7 Offset of Legally Required Payments .

 Unless the Company and the Eligible Employee otherwise agree in writing, any determination required under this Article 3.8 shall be made in writing in good faith by a nationally recognized accounting firm (the Accountants ). In the event of a reduction in 
 7 

Covered Payments hereunder, the reduction of the total payments shall be effected in compliance with Code Section 409A.

The Company and the Eligible Employee shall furnish to the Accountants such information and documents as the Accountants may reasonably request in order to make a determination under this Article 3.8. The Company shall bear all costs the Accountants may reasonably incur in connection with any calculations contemplated by this Article 3.8. 
 
 If notwithstanding any reduction described in this Article 3.8, the Internal Revenue Service IRS determines that an Eligible Employee is liable for the Excise Tax as a result of the receipt of the Covered Payments, then such Eligible Employee shall be obligated to pay back to the Company, within thirty (30) days after a final IRS determination or in the event that such Eligible Employee challenges the final IRS determination, a final judicial determination a portion of such amounts equal to the Repayment Amount . The Repayment Amount shall be the smallest such amount, if any, as shall be required to be paid to the Company so that the applicable Eligible Employee s net after-tax proceeds with respect to any payment of the Covered Payments (after taking into account the payment of the Excise Tax and all other applicable taxes imposed on the Covered Payments) shall be maximized. The Repayment Amount with respect to the payment of Covered Payments shall be zero if a Repayment Amount of more than zero would not result in an Eligible Employee s net after-tax proceeds with respect to the payment of the Covered Payments being maximized. If the Excise Tax is not eliminated pursuant to this paragraph, the applicable Eligible Employee shall pay the Excise Tax. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article 3.8, if (1) there is a reduction in the payment of Covered Payments as described in this Article 3.8, (2) the IRS later determines that an Eligible Employee is liable for the Excise Tax, the payment of which would result in the maximization of such Eligible Employee s net after-tax proceeds (calculated as if the Covered Payments had not previously been reduced), and (3) the Eligible Employee pays the Excise Tax, then the Company shall pay to the applicable Eligible Employee those Covered Payments which were reduced pursuant to this Article 3.8 contemporaneously or as soon as administratively possible after the Eligible Employee pays the Excise Tax so that the Eligible Employee s net after-tax proceeds with respect to the payment of Covered Payments are maximized.

No one, including your employer, or any other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a welfare benefit or exercising your rights under ERISA. 
 
 Enforce Your Rights 
 
 If your claim for a welfare benefit is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you have a right to know why this was done and have the right to obtain copies of documents relating to the decision, without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules. 
 
 Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if you request a copy of plan documents or the latest annual report from the plan and do not receive them within 30 days, you may file suit in a federal court. In such a case, the court may require the plan administrator to provide the materials and pay you up to 110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the administrator. If you have a claim for benefits that is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or federal court. In addition, if you disagree with the plan s decision or lack thereof concerning the qualified status of a domestic relations order or a medical child support order, you may file suit in federal court. If it should happen that plan fiduciaries misuse the plan s money, or if you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees. If you are successful the court may order the person you have sued to pay these costs and fees. If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous. 
 
 Assistance with Your Questions 
 
 If you have any questions about your plan, you should contact the plan administrator. If you have any questions about this statement or about your rights under ERISA, or if you need assistance in obtaining documents from the plan administrator, you should contact the nearest office of the Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, listed in your telephone directory or the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries, Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210. 
 
 You may also obtain certain publications about your rights and responsibilities under ERISA by calling the publications hotline of the Employee Benefits Security Administration.
