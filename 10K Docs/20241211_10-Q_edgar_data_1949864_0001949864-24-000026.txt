at October 31, 2024, had a net loss of ,
and used net cash of in operating activities for the six months ended October 31, 2024. These factors raise substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon generating profitable operations
in the future and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business
operations when they come due. Our management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash, sales
proceeds and related party loans. While we believe that we will be successful in obtaining the necessary financing and generating revenue
to fund our operations, meet regulatory requirements, and achieve commercial goals, there are no assurances that such additional funding
will be achieved and that we will succeed in our future operations.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 

 The Company continually monitors events and changes
in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances
are present, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will
be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of
those assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets.
Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell.

reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its
principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate
