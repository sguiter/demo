 Timarron Park On June 14, 2018, the Company was served with a petition involving approximately individuals or entities who claim that their properties, located in the Timarron Park neighborhood of The Woodlands, were damaged by flood waters that resulted from the unprecedented rainfall that occurred throughout Harris County and surrounding areas during Hurricane Harvey in August 2017. The complaint was filed in State Court in Harris County of the State of Texas. In general, the plaintiffs allege negligence in the development of Timarron Park and violations of Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act and name as defendants The Howard Hughes Corporation, The Woodlands Land Development Company, and unaffiliated parties involved in the planning and engineering of Timarron Park. The plaintiffs are seeking restitution for damages to their properties and diminution of their property values.

The sixth and final amendment of resolution of disputes and release agreement was executed during the first quarter of 2024, thereby releasing the Company from any further claims or demands from the Waiea homeowners association arising from or relating to the construction or repair of the condominium project. As of September 30, 2024, million remains in Construction payables for the estimated repair costs related to this matter, which is included in Accounts payable and other liabilities in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 In July 2024, the Company executed a settlement agreement with the general contractor, the Waiea homeowners association, and various insurance carriers. As part of this settlement, the Company received million of insurance proceeds from various insurance carriers during the three months ended September 30, 2024, which was recognized in Other income (loss), net in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The amount received represents the full payout of the related insurance policy and per the executed agreement the Company agreed to release the general contractor and the insurance carriers from any further claims related to the construction defects at the condominium tower. 
 
 Also as part of this settlement agreement, the Company agreed to pay the general contractor million, representing the final payment of project costs previously incurred by the general contractor. This amount was paid in September 2024, and as the Company had million accrued at December 31, 2023, related to these costs, the difference of million was recognized in Condominium rights and units cost of sales in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 Operating Leases The Company leases land or buildings at certain properties from third parties, which are recorded in Operating lease right-of-use assets and Operating lease obligations on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 14 - Leases for further discussion. 
 
 Guaranty Agreements The Company evaluates the likelihood of future performance under the below guarantees and, as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, there were no events requiring financial performance under these guarantees. 
 
 Seaport Entertainment Guaranty Immediately prior to the spinoff, 250 Seaport District, LLC (SEG Borrower), then a subsidiary of the Company, refinanced the existing mortgage loan related to the 250 Water Street property. This included the repayment of the existing mortgage loan payable with a carrying value of million and the incurrence of million in new mortgage indebtedness (SEG Term Loan). As part of the refinancing, SEG Borrower also entered into a total return swap with a third party lender to provide credit support for the SEG Term Loan, which was supported by a guaranty provided by a separate subsidiary of the Company (HHC Guarantor). The SEG Term Loan and related total return swap were included in the liabilities transferred to Seaport Entertainment upon completion of the spinoff. As a result, following the spinoff, HHC Guarantor now provides a full backstop guaranty for the SEG Term Loan. 
 
 The SEG Term Loan agreement is scheduled to mature on July 1, 2029. Collateral for the loan includes the 250 Water Street property which was transferred to SEG upon completion of the spinoff. Under the terms of SEG s loan agreement, the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio must not exceed certain thresholds. In the event the LTV ratio exceeds the applicable threshold, SEG must pay down the loan to an amount that would result in a LTV ratio under the applicable threshold. In the event SEG fails to make any necessary payments when due, HHC Guarantor is required to make all payments in full. 
 
 In consideration of HHC Guarantor providing such guaranty, SEG will pay the Company an annualized guaranty fee equal to of the total outstanding principal, paid monthly. The Company s maximum exposure under this guaranty is equal to the outstanding principal and interest balance at the end of each period. Given the value of the 250 Water Street property collateral, the Company does not expect to have to perform under this guaranty. As of September 30, 2024, the SEG Term Loan LTV ratio is under the applicable threshold.

-owned joint venture in Teravalis, closed on a million bond financing with a maturity date of October 1, 2027. Outstanding borrowings as of September 30, 2024, were million. A wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (HHC Member) provided a guaranty for the bond in the form of a collateral maintenance commitment under which it will post refundable cash collateral if the LTV ratio exceeds . A separate wholly owned subsidiary of the Company also provided a backstop guaranty of up to million of the cash collateral commitment in the event HHC Member fails to make necessary payments when due. The cash collateral becomes nonrefundable if Floreo defaults on the bond obligation. The Company received a fee of million in exchange for providing this guaranty, which was recorded in Accounts payable and other liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. This liability amount will be recognized in Other income (loss), net in a manner that corresponds to the bond repayment by Floreo. The Company s maximum exposure under this guaranty is equal to the cash collateral that the Company may be obligated to post. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not posted any cash collateral. Given the existence of other collateral including the undeveloped land owned by Floreo, the entity s extensive and discretionary development plan, and its eligibility for reimbursement of a significant part of the development costs from the Community Facility District in Arizona, the Company does not expect to have to post collateral. 
 
 Downtown Columbia The Company s wholly owned subsidiaries agreed to complete defined public improvements and to indemnify Howard County, Maryland for certain matters as part of the Downtown Columbia Redevelopment District TIF bonds. To the extent that increases in taxes do not cover debt service payments on the TIF bonds, the Company s wholly owned subsidiary is obligated to pay special taxes. Management has concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, any obligations to pay special taxes are not probable. 
 
 Ward Village As part of the Company s development permits with the Hawai i Community Development Authority for the condominium towers at Ward Village, the Company entered into a guaranty whereby it is required to reserve of the residential units for local residents who meet certain maximum income and net worth requirements. This guaranty, which is triggered once the necessary permits are granted and construction commences, was satisfied for Waiea, Anaha, and Ae`o, with the opening of Ke Kilohana, which is a workforce tower fully earmarked to fulfill this obligation for the first towers. The reserved units for A ali i tower are included in the A ali i tower. Units for K 'ula, Victoria Place, The Park Ward Village, and Kalae will be satisfied with the construction of Ulana Ward Village, which is a second workforce tower fully earmarked to fulfill the remaining reserved housing guaranty in the community. Construction on Ulana Ward Village began in early 2023.

business segments that offer different products and services. HHC s segments are managed separately because each requires different operating strategies or management expertise that are reflective of management s operating philosophies and methods. Because the Company s segments, Operating Assets, MPC, and Strategic Developments, are managed separately, the Company uses different operating measures to assess operating results and allocate resources among them. The one common operating measure used to assess operating results for the Company s business segments is earnings before tax (EBT). EBT, as it relates to each business segment, includes the revenues and expenses of each segment, as shown below. EBT excludes corporate expenses and other items that are not allocable to the segments. The Company presents EBT for each segment because the Company uses this measure, among others, internally to assess the core operating performance of the Company s assets. The Company s segments or assets within such segments could change in the future as development of certain properties commences or other operational or management changes occur. All operations are within the United States. The Company s reportable segments are as follows: 
 
 Operating Assets consists of developed or acquired retail, office, and multi-family properties along with other real estate investments. These properties are currently generating revenues and may be redeveloped, repositioned, or sold to improve segment performance or to recycle capital. 
 MPC consists of the development and sale of land in large scale, long term community development projects in and around Las Vegas, Nevada; Houston, Texas; and Phoenix, Arizona. 
 Strategic Developments consists of residential condominium and commercial property projects currently under development and all other properties held for development which have no substantial operations.

OVERVIEW 
 Description of Business 
 
 Our award-winning assets include one of the nation's largest portfolios of MPCs, spanning approximately 101,000 gross acres, as well as operating properties, strategic developments, and other assets across five states. We create some of the most sought-after communities in the country by curating an environment tailored to meet the needs of our residents and tenants. Our unique business model allows us to seek attractive risk-adjusted returns while maintaining a sharp focus on sustainability to ensure our communities are equipped with the resources to last several decades. 
 
 On July 31, 2024, the spinoff of Seaport Entertainment Group Inc. (SEG) was completed. The spinoff included all assets previously included in the Company s Seaport segment and the Las Vegas Aviators and the Las Vegas Ballpark, which were previously included in the Operating Assets segment. The separation of SEG from Howard Hughes refined the identity of the Company as a pure-play real estate company focused solely on our core businesses and development of our MPCs. As the spinoff of SEG represents a strategic shift in the Company s operations, the results of SEG are included as discontinued operations for all periods presented and disclosures presented in this MD A are presented on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise noted. Refer to Note 2 - Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 
 We operate through three business segments: Operating Assets, MPCs, and Strategic Developments. We create a continuous value-creation cycle through operational and financial synergies associated with our three business segments of Operating Assets, MPCs, and Strategic Developments. In our MPC segment, we plan, develop, and manage small cities and large-scale, mixed-use communities, in markets with strong long-term growth fundamentals. This business focuses on the horizontal development of residential land. The improved acreage is then sold to homebuilders who build and sell homes to new residents. New homeowners create demand for commercial developments, such as retail, office, and hospitality offerings. We build these commercial properties through Strategic Developments at the appropriate times using the cash flow harvested from the sale of land to homebuilders, which helps mitigate development risk. Once the commercial developments are completed, the assets transition to Operating Assets, which increases recurring Net Operating Income (NOI), further funding our Strategic Developments. New office, retail, and other commercial amenities make our MPC residential land more appealing to buyers and increase the velocity of land sales at premiums that typically exceed the broader market. This increased demand for residential land generates more cash flow from MPCs, thus continuing the value-creation cycle. 
 
 In addition to the required presentations using GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP performance measures, such as NOI and MPC Net Contribution. See the Operating Assets and MPC sections below for the reconciliations of these GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures and statements indicating why management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information for investors. 
 
 Changes for monetary amounts between periods presented are calculated based on the amounts in thousands of dollars stated in our consolidated financial statements, and then rounded to the nearest million. Therefore, certain changes may not recalculate based on the amounts rounded to the nearest million.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2024, to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Net income from continuing operations increased 94.3 million to 125.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 30.7 million in the prior-year period. 
 
 MPC EBT increased 90.1 million primarily due to higher residential land sales, net of costs, in Summerlin due to an increase in superpad sales in the current year and higher residential land sales, net of costs in The Woodlands Hills, partially offset by lower equity earnings at The Summit, lower commercial land sales in Bridgeland, and lower residential land sales in The Woodlands. 
 Strategic Developments EBT increased 87.1 million primarily due to a 90.0 million increase in other income related to the receipt of insurance proceeds in the current year following the execution of a settlement agreement related to the construction defect claims at Waiea. Refer to Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 Operating Assets EBT decreased 26.7 million primarily due to an increase in interest expense related to increased borrowings on loans secured by our operating assets and an increase related to the change in fair value of certain derivative assets, a decrease in gain on sale of real estate, an increase in depreciation expense related to new assets placed in service, and a decrease in revenue due to office lease termination fees in the prior-year period. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in rental revenues, net of operating costs due to increased leasing activity across our portfolio. 
 Corporate income, expenses, and other items included an increase in net expenses of 56.3 million primarily due to a loss on the sale of MUD receivables recognized in the current year.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024: 
 
 Operating Assets segment EBT decreased 16.3 million compared to the prior-year period primarily due to the following: 
 Gain on sale of real estate decreased 12.9 million primarily due to the sale of two self-storage properties in The Woodlands in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Interest expense increased 5.3 million primarily due to increased borrowings on construction loans secured by our operating assets as well as an increase related to the change in fair value of certain derivative instruments. 
 Equity earnings decreased 3.5 million primarily as a result of a decrease related to the change in value of certain derivative instruments associated with The Metropolitan and TEN.m.flats. 
 Depreciation expense increased 1.6 million primarily related to new assets placed in service. 
 
 These decreases to EBT were partially offset by the following: 
 Rental revenues, net of Operating costs increased 6.3 million primarily due to increased leasing activity across our portfolio. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024: 
 
 Operating Assets segment EBT decreased 26.7 million compared to the prior-year period primarily due to the following: 
 Interest expense increased 14.3 million primarily due to increased borrowings on construction loans secured by our operating assets as well as an increase related to the change in fair value of certain derivative instruments. 
 Gain on sale of real estate decreased 12.8 million primarily due to the sale of Creekside Park Medical Plaza in the 2024, compared to the sale of two self-storage properties in The Woodlands and certain properties in Ward Village in 2023. 
 Depreciation expense increased 9.4 million primarily related to new assets placed in service. 
 Other land, rental, and property revenues decreased 4.3 million primarily due to office lease termination fees in the prior year. 
 
 These decreases to EBT were partially offset by the following: 
 Rental revenues, net of Operating costs increased 17.9 million primarily due to increased leasing activity across our portfolio. 
 
 Net Operating Income In addition to the required presentations using GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP performance measures, as we believe these measures improve the understanding of our operational results and make comparisons of operating results among peer companies more meaningful. Management continually evaluates the usefulness, relevance, limitations and calculation of our reported non-GAAP performance measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public, and thus such reported measures could change. 
 
 We define NOI as operating revenues (rental income, tenant recoveries, and other revenue) less operating expenses (real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, marketing, and other property expenses). NOI excludes straight-line rents and amortization of tenant incentives, net; interest expense, net; ground rent amortization; demolition costs; other income (loss); depreciation and amortization; development-related marketing costs; gain on sale or disposal of real estate and other assets, net; loss on extinguishment of debt; provision for impairment; and equity in earnings from unconsolidated ventures. 
 
 We believe that NOI is a useful supplemental measure of the performance of our Operating Assets segment because it provides a performance measure that reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating real estate properties. We use NOI to evaluate our operating performance on a property-by-property basis because NOI allows us to evaluate the impact that property-specific factors such as rental and occupancy rates, tenant mix, and operating costs have on our operating results, gross margins, and investment returns.

 Multi-family NOI increased 2.1 million primarily due to continued lease-up at our newer properties, Tanager Echo in Summerlin, Marlow in Downtown Columbia, and Starling at Bridgeland. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024: 
 
 Operating Assets NOI increased 10.3 million compared to the prior-year period primarily due to the following: 
 Office NOI increased 4.9 million primarily due to strong leasing activity and abatement expirations at various properties in The Woodlands and Summerlin, most notably at 9950 Woodloch Forest and 1700 Pavilion, partially offset by decreases related to lower occupancy at 1725 Hughes Landing and office lease termination fees received in the prior-year period. 
 Multi-family NOI increased 4.3 million primarily due to continued lease-up at our newer properties, Marlow in Downtown Columbia and Starling at Bridgeland, and Tanager Echo in Summerlin, partially offset by winter-weather-related insurance recoveries in 2023. 
 Retail NOI increased 2.5 million primarily due to the collection of previously reserved accounts receivable in Ward Village as well as improved occupancy in the ground floor retail at Juniper and Marlow in Downtown Columbia.

 (b) Builder price participation revenue is earned when a developer that acquired land from us develops and sells a home to an end user at a price higher than a predetermined breakpoint. The excess over the breakpoint is shared between us and the developer at the time of closing on the sale of the home based on a previously agreed-upon percentage. This revenue fluctuates based upon the number and the prices of homes closed that qualify for builder price participation payments.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Table of Contents 

MPC Net Contribution MPC Net Contribution is a non-GAAP financial measure derived from EBT, adjusted for certain items as discussed below. Management uses this measure because it captures current period performance through the velocity of sales, as well as current period development expenditures based upon demand at our MPCs, which varies depending upon the stage of the MPCs development lifecycle, and the overall economic environment. MPC Net Contribution is defined as MPC segment EBT, plus MPC cost of sales, Depreciation and amortization, and net collections from MUD and SID bonds receivables, reduced by MPC development expenditures, land acquisitions, and Equity in earnings from unconsolidated ventures, net of distributions. MPC Net Contribution is not a GAAP-based operational metric and should not be used to measure operating performance of the MPC assets as a substitute for GAAP measures of such performance nor should it be used as a comparison metric with other comparable businesses.

Strategic Developments 
 
 Our Strategic Developments assets generally require substantial future development to maximize their value. Other than our condominium properties, most of the properties and projects in this segment do not generate revenues. Our expenses relating to these assets are primarily related to costs associated with constructing the assets, selling condominiums, marketing costs associated with our Strategic Developments, carrying costs including, but not limited to, property taxes and insurance, and other ongoing costs relating to maintaining the assets in their current condition. If we decide to redevelop or develop a Strategic Developments asset, we expect that with the exception of the residential portion of our condominium projects, upon completion of development, the asset would likely be reclassified to Operating Assets when the asset is placed in service and NOI would become a meaningful measure of its operating performance. All development costs discussed herein are exclusive of land costs.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024: 
 
 Strategic Developments segment EBT increased 77.0 million compared to the prior-year period primarily due to the following: 
 Other income includes an increase of 90.0 million due to the receipt of insurance proceeds following the execution of a settlement agreement related to the construction defect claims at Waiea in the current period. Refer to Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 
 This increase to EBT was partially offset by the following: 
 Condominium sales, net of cost of sales decreased 3.1 million, excluding the impact of Waiea settlement costs, due to the timing of condominium closings. We had no condominium closings during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 16 units at A ali i and 10 units at K 'ula during the prior-year quarter. The lower volume of condominium closings is expected as our completed towers are now 100 sold and the next tower, Victoria Place, is not scheduled for completion until late 2024. 
 Condominium cost of sales includes an increase of 12.1 million related to the settlement of final project costs previously incurred by the Waiea general contractor .

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024: 
 
 Strategic Developments segment EBT increased 87.1 million compared to the prior-year period primarily due to the following: 
 Other income includes an increase of 90.0 million due to the receipt of insurance proceeds following the execution of a settlement agreement related to the construction defect claims at Waiea in the current period. 
 Condominium cost of sales includes a decrease of 13.1 million due to charges related to the construction defect remediation at Waiea. We charged 3.0 million in the first quarter of 2024, to fund the final remediation expenditures, compared to 16.1 million of additional costs charged in the prior-year period. 
 
 These increases to EBT were partially offset by the following: 
 Condominium sales, net of cost of sales decreased 7.2 million, excluding the impact of Waiea remediation and settlement costs , due to the timing of condominium closings. We had no condominium closings during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 31 units at A ali i and 15 units at K 'ula during the prior-year period. 
 Condominium cost of sales includes an increase of 12.1 million related to the settlement of final project costs previously incurred by the Waiea general contractor . 
 
 Condominiums Condominium revenue is recognized when construction of the condominium tower is complete and unit sales close, leading to variability in revenue recognized between periods.

 Loss on sale of MUD receivables of 51.5 million was recognized in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Income tax expense increased 6.8 million primarily due to a net increase in expense related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the spinoff, as well as an increase in Income before income taxes. These increases were offset by a partial release of valuation allowances on the Company s deferred tax assets including a state net operating loss carryover as a result of the spinoff of Seaport Entertainment Group Inc.
