is described in Note 3, and the sale of Units (the Private Placement Units at a price of per Private Placement
Unit in private placements to the Sponsors that was closed simultaneously with the IPO, generating gross proceeds of . 

The
Company granted the underwriter a 45-day option from the date of the IPO to purchase up to additional Units to cover over-allotment,
if any, at the IPO price less the underwriting discounts and commissions. On January 28, 2024, the underwriter did not exercise their
over-allotment option and hence a total of ordinary shares were forfeited by the Sponsors. 

The
Company will have until the last extended date, June 19, 2025, to consummate a Business Combination. However, if the Company has not
completed a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding
up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem of the Public Shares, at a per-share
price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned and not previously
released to us to pay our taxes, if any (less certain amount of interest to pay liquidation and dissolution expenses), divided by the
number of then issued and outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish the rights of the Public Shareholders
as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible
following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining Public Shareholders and its Board of Directors, liquidate
and dissolve, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and
the requirements of other applicable law. 

Proposed
Business Combination 

On
June 7, 2024, the Company entered into the execution of an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement ), by and
among the Company, Oabay Holding Company, a Cayman Islands exempted company limited by shares PubCo ), Bayview Acquisition
Corp, a Cayman Islands exempted company limited by shares SPAC ), Bayview Merger Sub 1 Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted
company limited by shares and a wholly-owned subsidiary of PubCo Merger Sub 1 ), Bayview Merger Sub 2 Limited, a Cayman
Islands exempted company limited by shares and a wholly-owned subsidiary of PubCo Merger Sub 2 ), Oabay Merger Sub Limited,
a Cayman Islands exempted company limited by shares and a wholly-owned subsidiary of PubCo Merger Sub 3 ), BLAFC Limited,
a business company limited by shares in the British Virgin Islands, Bayview Holding LP, a Delaware limited partnership, and Peace Investment
Holdings Limited, pursuant to which, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth therein, (i) SPAC will merge
with and into Merger Sub 1, with SPAC surviving the merger in accordance with the Companies Act (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands (the
 Act (the First SPAC Merger ), (ii) immediately following the First SPAC Merger, SPAC will merge with and
into Merger Sub 2, with Merger Sub 2 surviving the Merger in accordance with the Act (the Second SPAC Merger and together
with the First SPAC Merger, the Initial Mergers ), and (iii) following the Initial Mergers, Merger Sub 3 will merge with
and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving entity and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of PubCo in accordance with
the Act (the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Business Combination ). 

On
June 26, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which all parties agreed to revise the earnout
milestones to reflect new consolidated revenue metrics. Among other things, the 

Extension 

On
September 16, 2024, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting virtually and in person, solely with respect to voting on (i) the
proposal to extend the date by which the Company must complete its initial business combination from September 19, 2024 to June 19, 2025,
with all nine (9) extensions comprised of one month each and (ii) the proposal to amend the Company s investment management trust
agreement, dated December 14, 2023 by and between the Company and Equiniti Trust Company, LLC to allow the Company to extend the Termination
Date up to nine (9) times, with all nine (9) extensions comprised of one month each from the Termination Date to June 19, 2025 by providing
five days advance notice to the Trustee prior to the applicable Termination Date and depositing into the Trust Account 
for each month in an Extension until June 19, 2025. 

In
connection with the vote to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal, the holders of 
Ordinary Shares properly exercised their rights to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately per share,
for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately . 

On
September 16, 2024, the Company issued a promissory note to Oabay, pursuant to which the Company could borrow an aggregate of 
to cover the expense in connection with the extension of the Business Combination (the Extension Note 1 ). Extension Note
1 bears no interest and is payable on the earlier of: (i) June 19, 2025, or (ii) promptly after the date of the consummation of the Business
Combination. On September 16, 2024, the Company deposited into the trust account to extend the timeline for the business combination
from September 19, 2024 to October 19, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, was outstanding under Extension Note 1. 

Going
Concern Consideration 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of and a working capital deficit of . The Company has incurred and expects
to continue to incur significant professional costs to remain as a public traded company and to incur transaction costs in pursuit of
a Business Combination. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting
Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going
Concern, management believes that these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a
going concern. In addition, if the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and such period
is not extended, there will be a liquidation and subsequent dissolution. As a result, management has determined that such additional
condition also raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do
not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the uncertainty.

and , respectively. The interests earned from the trust account totaled and

2024. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals, or material
deviation from its position. 

There

income taxes are not levied on the Company. Consequently, income taxes are not reflected in the Company s financial statements.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Overview 

We
are a blank check company incorporated on February 16, 2023, as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger,
share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which
we refer to throughout the Registration Statement as our initial business combination. We have generated no revenues to date, and we
do not expect that we will generate operating revenues at the earliest until we consummate our initial business combination. We have
not selected any specific business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, engaged in any substantive discussions,
directly or indirectly, with any business combination target with respect to an initial business combination with us. 

Results
of Operations and Known Trends or Future Events 

We
have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities since February 16, 2023 (inception) to
September 30, 2024, have been organizational activities and those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering (the IPO described below and identifying a target company for initial Business Combination.. Following our IPO, we would not generate any operating
revenues until the completion of our initial business combination. We would generate non-operating income in the form of interest income
after the IPO. We expect to incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting
and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 583,558, which consists of income earned on investment held in Trust
Account of 856,587 offset by loss of 273,029 derived from formation and operating costs. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 1,771,223, which consists of income earned on investment held in Trust
Account of 2,324,692 offset by loss of 553,469 derived from formation and operating costs. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net loss of 3,823, which consists of loss of 3,823 derived from formation and operating
costs. 

For
the period from February 16, 2023 (inception) through September 30, 2023, we had a net loss of 6,928, which consists of loss of 6,928
derived from formation and operating costs. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

On
December 19, 2023, we consummated our IPO of 6,000,000 Units, at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 60,000,000. Simultaneously
with the closing of the IPO, we consummated the sale of 232,500 Private Placement Units at a price of 10.00 per Private Placement Unit,
generating total gross proceeds of 2,325,000. Following the closing of the IPO, an amount of 60,000,000 from the net proceeds of the
sale of the Units in the IPO and the Private Placement was held in a trust account. The funds held in the trust account may be invested
in U.S. government securities with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a
money market fund selected by us. 

16 

We
granted the underwriter a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 900,000 Units at the IPO price to cover over-allotment, if any.
On January 28, 2023, a total of 225,000 ordinary shares were forfeited by the Sponsors since the underwriter did not exercise their over-allotment
option. 

As
of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalent balance was 225,472. We will use these funds primarily to identify and evaluate
target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar
locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of
prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a business combination. 

We
expect our primary liquidity requirements during that period to include approximately 200,000 in legal, accounting, due diligence and
other fees in connection with the business combination; 100,000 in legal and accounting related to regulatory reporting obligations,
 120,000 for office space, administrative and support services, 55,000 in NASDAQ continued listing fees and 100,000 for miscellaneous
expenses, including director and officer s liability insurance, general corporate purposes, liquidation obligations and reserves. 

As
indicated in the accompanying financial statements, as of September 30, 2024, we had a working capital deficit of 308,229. Further,
we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of our financing and acquisition plans. 

Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

The
net proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Units held in the trust account will be invested in U.S. government treasury
bills with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company
Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe there
will be no associated material exposure to interest rate risk.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements; Commitments and Contractual Obligations; Quarterly Results 

As
of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K and did
not have any commitments or contractual obligations. No unaudited quarterly operating data is included in the Registration Statement,
as we have conducted no operations to date. 

JOBS
Act 

On
April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements
for qualifying public companies. We will qualify as an emerging growth company and under the JOBS Act will be allowed to
comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are
electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting
standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial
statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective
dates. 

Additionally,
we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject
to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an emerging growth company , we choose to rely on such exemptions
we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over
financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth
public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted
by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about
the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items
such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO s compensation to median employee
compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of the IPO or until we are no longer an
 emerging growth company, whichever is earlier.

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise
required under this item. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our management evaluated, with the participation of our current chief executive officer and chief financial officer (our Certifying
Officers ), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under
the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls
and procedures were effective. 

We
do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and
procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure
controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all
our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions. 

Management s
Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) and for our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and
our Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our Board, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an assessment regarding the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on the framework established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment under the criteria
described above, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2024,
solely due to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the Company s lack of qualified
SEC reporting professional. As a result, we performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our financial statements
were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this Form 10-Q
present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, result of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. Management
intends to continue implement remediation steps to improve our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial
reporting. Specifically, we intend to expand and improve our review process for complex securities and related accounting standards.
We have improved this process by enhancing access to accounting literature, identification of third-party professionals with whom to
consult regarding complex accounting applications and consideration of additional staff with the requisite experience and training to
supplement existing accounting professionals.

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange
Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

1A. RISK FACTORS 

Factors
that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this Quarterly Report are any of the risks described in (i) our
