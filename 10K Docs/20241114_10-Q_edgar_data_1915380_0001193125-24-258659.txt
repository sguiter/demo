On October 7, 2022, the underwriter exercised its over-allotment option in part, and on October 11, 2022, the underwriter purchased additional units (the Over-Allotment Units ), generating gross proceeds of approximately million (the Partial Over-Allotment ). The underwriter waived the remainder of its over-allotment option. The Company incurred additional offering costs of approximately in connection with the Partial Over-Allotment (of which approximately was for deferred underwriting fees). 
 Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the private placement Private Placement of warrants (the Initial Private Placement Warrants ), at a price of per Initial Private Placement Warrant to the Sponsor, generating proceeds of approximately million (see Note 4). On October 11, 2022, simultaneously with the issuance and sale of the Over-Allotment Units, the Company consummated the sale of an additional private placement warrants at per private placement warrant (the Additional Private Placement Warrants , and together with the Initial Private Placement Warrants, the Private Placement Warrants ), generating additional gross proceeds of approximately . 
 In addition, concurrently with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor extended an overfunding loan to the Company in an amount of at no interest (the Initial Overfunding Loan to deposit in the Trust Account (as defined below). On October 11, 2022, simultaneously with the sale of the Over-Allotment Units, the Sponsor extended a further overfunding loan to the Company in an aggregate amount of (the Additional Overfunding Loan , and together with the Initial Overfunding Loan, the Overfunding Loans to deposit in the Trust Account. 
 Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Partial Over-Allotment, the Private Placement and the Overfunding Loans, approximately million per unit) of the net proceeds of the sale of the units and the Private Placement Warrants and the proceeds from the Overfunding Loans were placed in a trust account (the Trust Account with Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company acting as trustee and was invested in United States government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ), with a maturity of days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting certain conditions of Rule 2a-7 of
 the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of (i) the completion of a Business Combination, (ii) the redemption of Public Shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to amend the Amended and Restated Articles of Organization (the Charter to modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to redeem of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period (as defined below) or with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders rights or pre-initial Business
 Combination activity, and (iii) return of the funds held in the Trust Account to holders of Public Shares (the Public Shareholders as part of the redemption of the Public Shares if the Company does not complete an initial Business Combination during the Combination Period. On September 25, 2024, the Company transferred its Trust Account out of investment in securities into an interest-bearing bank deposit account in order to mitigate the risk of being deemed an unregistered investment company. 

of the net assets held in the Trust Account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes and excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial Business Combination. However, the Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires or more of the voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. 
 The Company provides Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholders meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The Public Shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then held in the Trust Account (initially at per Public Share). The per-share amount
 to be distributed to Public Shareholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriter (as discussed in Note 5). 
 These Public Shares are recorded at redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 ). The Company will proceed with a Business Combination if a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. The Company s Charter initially required the Company to not redeem the Public Shares in an amount that would cause its net tangible assets to be less than .
 In January 2024, the shareholders approved the proposal to amend the Charter and eliminate such Redemption Limitation (as defined below). If a shareholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Charter, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain shareholder approval for business or legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the initial shareholders agreed to vote their Founder Shares (as defined in Note 4) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of a Business Combination. In addition, the initial shareholders agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and Public Shares in connection with the completion of a Business Combination. 
 The Company s Charter provides that a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of or more of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company. 
 The Sponsor and the Company s officers agreed not to propose an amendment to the Charter to modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to redeem of the Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period (as defined below), or with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders rights or pre-initial Business
 Combination activity, unless the Company provides the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment. 

months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, or January 4, 2024 (the Prior Outside Date ), to consummate an initial Business Combination. The Charter also permitted the Company, by resolution of the board of directors, to extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination twice by an additional 3-month period (for
 a total of months to complete a Business Combination), subject to the Sponsor depositing into the Trust Account in the aggregate for each extension (the Prior Contributions ). The Sponsor did not intend to deposit such Prior Contributions into the Trust Account. Accordingly, following January 4, 2024, the Company would have been forced to liquidate. 
 The Company s board determined that, in order for the Company to have additional time to complete a Business Combination in a more cost effective manner, it would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to extend the Prior Outside Date to allow for a period of additional time to consummate the Business Combination. On January 2, 2024, the Company held a special meeting of its shareholders (the Special Meeting ). At the Special Meeting, the Company s shareholders approved an amendment of the Charter to extend (the Extension the date by which the Company has to consummate a Business Combination up to twenty-three (23) times for an additional one (1) month each time (each, an Extension Period ), with the first Extension Period being from January 4, 2024 to January 29, 2024 (the Extended Date and each subsequent Extension Period being one calendar month each time, until up to December 29, 2025 (each, an Additional Extended Date , and such period in its entirety, from the Initial Public Offering until the final Additional Extended Date, the Combination Period ), only if the Sponsor or its designee would deposit (the Contribution into the Trust Account as a loan, (i) on or before January 4, 2024, with respect to the initial extension to the Extended Date, an amount of , and (ii) one business day following the public announcement by the Company disclosing that the board of directors has determined to implement an additional monthly extension, with respect to each such Extension Period, an amount of . In connection with the shareholder approval of the Extension, an aggregate of Public Shares were redeemed, and the Company paid approximately million accordingly on January 4, 2024. 
 At the Special Meeting, the Company s shareholders also approved proposals to (1) amend the Charter to provide for the right of a holder of Class B Shares (as defined below) to convert their Class B Shares into Class A Shares on a one-for-one basis at any

 time and from time to time at the election of the holder; (2) amend the Charter to eliminate from the Charter (i) the limitation that the Company may not redeem Public Shares in an amount that would cause its net tangible assets to be less than and (ii) the limitation that the Company shall not consummate a Business Combination unless it has net tangible assets of at least (collectively, the Redemption Limitation (3) amend the Charter to permit the board of directors, in its sole discretion, to elect to wind up operations on an earlier date than the Extended Date or Additional Extended Date, as applicable, as determined by the board of directors and included in a public announcement (the Liquidation Amendment and (4) amend the Investment Management Trust Agreement between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company to reflect the Extension and the Liquidation Amendment. 
 In connection with the Contribution and advances the Sponsor or its affiliates may make in the future to the Company for working capital expenses, on January 2, 2024, the Company issued a convertible promissory note to Harry L. You, Chairman and Chief Financial Officer and an affiliate of the Sponsor (the Payee ), with a principal amount up to million (the Convertible Note ). The Convertible Note bears interest and is repayable on the earlier of (i) the date on which the Company consummates an initial Business Combination and (ii) the liquidation date. If the Company does not consummate a Business Combination before the end of the Combination Period, the Convertible Note will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. Upon the consummation of the initial Business Combination, the outstanding principal of the Convertible Note may be converted into warrants, at a price of per warrant, at the option of the Payee. Since January 2, 2024, the board of directors has elected to extend the liquidation date to November 29, 2024. Accordingly, the Company has drawn down from the Convertible Note and deposited into the Trust Account in connection with such extensions. 

of the Offering Shares in consideration of a per-share price,
 payable in cash, equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest not previously released to the Company to pay its taxes (less up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses), by (B) the total number of then outstanding Offering Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish rights of the Public Shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the board of directors in accordance with applicable law, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under the MBCA to provide for claims of creditors and other requirements of applicable law. 
 If the initial shareholders acquire Public Shares, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such Public Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriter agreed to waive its rights to the deferred underwriting commission (see Note 5) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the residual assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be only . In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party (except for the Company s independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or Business Combination agreement (a Target ), reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than 10.15 per Public Share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or Target that executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriter of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except the Company s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. 
 Going Concern Consideration 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately ,000 in cash and working capital deficit of approximately million. Further, the Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its acquisition plans. 
 Prior to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the Company s liquidity needs were satisfied 
through the payment of from the Sponsor to purchase Founder Shares (as defined in Note 4) and a loan under the Note (as defined in Note 4) in the amount of approximately . The Company fully repaid the Note balance on October 4, 2022. The Note was no longer available to the Company after closing of its Initial Public Offering. Subsequent to the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Partial Over-Allotment, the Company s liquidity needs have been satisfied through the net proceeds from the consummation of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement held outside of the Trust Account and advances from related parties (approximately outstanding as of September 30, 2024). Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company borrowed an additional amount of approximately from related parties, increasing the total outstanding amount of advances to approximately . 
 In addition, in order to provide the Contribution and to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Company issued the Convertible Note to the Payee with a principal amount up to million on January 2, 2024 as discussed above. The Company borrowed under the Convertible Note from January through September
 2024, and an additional amount of in October 2024, increasing the total amount outstanding under the Convertible Note to . All proceeds received under the Convertible Note were contributed into the Trust Account in connection with extensions to extend the Combination Period to November 29, 2024.

Transfers to/from Levels 1, 2, and 3 are recognized at the beginning of the reporting period. The estimated fair value of the Public Warrants transferred from a Level 3 measurement to a Level 1 fair value measurement in December 2022 when the Public Warrants were separately listed and traded. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value measurement for Public Warrants was transferred to Level 2 measurement due to low trading volume. Level 1 assets include investments in money market funds or U.S. Treasury securities. The Company uses inputs such as actual trade data, benchmark yields, quoted market prices from dealers or brokers, and other similar sources to determine the fair value of its investments. 
 The fair value of the Public Warrants and the Private Placement Warrants was initially measured using Black-Scholes option pricing model and Monte Carlo simulation method, respectively. Beginning in December 2022, the fair value of Public Warrants has been measured based on the listed market price of such Public Warrants. The estimated fair value of the Private Placement Warrants was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation method with Level 3 inputs as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Inherent in a Black-Scholes option pricing model and a Monte Carlo simulation method are assumptions related to expected stock-price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The Company estimates the volatility of its warrants based on implied volatility from the historical volatility of select peer company s common stock that matches the expected remaining life of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on
 the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants. The expected life of the warrants is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term. The dividend rate is based on the historical rate, which the Company anticipates remaining at zero.

Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on April 1, 2024. The Company s securities filings can be accessed on the EDGAR section of the SEC s website at www.sec.gov. Except as expressly required by applicable securities law, the Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Overview Our company, dMY Squared Technology Group, Inc., is a blank check company incorporated in Massachusetts. We were formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We are an emerging growth company and, as such, we are subject to all of the risks associated with emerging growth companies. As of September 30, 2024, we had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from February 15, 2022 (inception) through September 30, 2024 relates to our formation and the Initial Public Offering as described below, and since the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the search for a prospective initial Business Combination. We will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial Business Combination, at the earliest. We generate non-operating income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering. Our sponsor is dMY Squared Sponsor, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. The registration statement for our Initial Public Offering was declared effective on September 29, 2022. On October 4, 2022, we consummated its Initial Public Offering of 6,000,000 units, at 10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of 60.0 million, and incurring offering costs of approximately 3.7 million, of which 2.1 million and approximately 26,000 was for deferred underwriting commissions and offering costs allocated to derivate warrant liabilities, respectively. On October 7, 2022, the underwriter exercised its over-allotment option in part, and on October 11, 2022, the underwriter purchased 319,000 Over-Allotment Units, generating gross proceeds of approximately 3.2 million. The underwriter waived the remainder of its over-allotment option. We incurred additional offering costs of approximately 156,000 in connection with the underwriter s partial exercise of its over-allotment option (of which approximately 112,000 was for deferred underwriting fees). Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the Private Placement of 2,840,000 Initial Private Placement Warrants, at a price of 1.00 per Initial Private Placement Warrant to our Sponsor, generating proceeds of approximately 2.8 million. On October 11, 2022, simultaneously with the issuance and sale of the Over-Allotment Units, we consummated the sale of 44,660 Additional Private Placement Warrants generating additional gross proceeds of approximately 45,000. In addition, concurrently with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, our Sponsor extended an Initial Overfunding Loan to the Company in the amount of 900,000 at no interest, to be deposited in the Trust Account. On October 11, 2022, simultaneously with the sale of the Over-Allotment Units, our Sponsor extended an Additional Overfunding Loan to the Company in an aggregate amount of 47,850, to be deposited in the Trust Account.

Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Private Placement and the Overfunding Loans, approximately 64.1 million 10.15 per unit) of the net proceeds of the sale of the units, Over-Allotment Units, and the Private Placement Warrants and the proceeds from the Overfunding Loans were placed in the Trust Account and were invested in United States government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting certain conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination, (ii) the redemption of Public Shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our Charter to modify the substance or timing of our of our obligation to redeem 100 of our Public Shares if we do not complete our initial Business Combination within the Combination Period or with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity, and (iii) our return of the funds held in the Trust Account to our Public Shareholders as part of our redemption of the Public Shares if we do not complete an initial Business Combination during the Combination Period. At the Special Meeting on January 2, 2024, the Company s shareholders approved an amendment to the Investment Management Trust Agreement, permitting the trustee to, in a timely manner, upon the written instruction of the Company, (i) hold funds uninvested, (ii) hold funds in an interest-bearing bank demand deposit account, or (iii) invest and reinvest the Property in solely United States government securities within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, having a maturity of 185 days or less, or in money market funds meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act, which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. The trustee is not permitted to invest in other securities or assets. Investing in our securities is not intended for persons who are seeking a return on investments in government securities or investment securities. Instead, the Trust Account is intended as a holding place for funds pending the use of such funds upon completion of a Business Combination or distribution upon redemption of our Public Shares. On September 25, 2024, the Company transferred its Trust Account out of investment in securities into an interest-bearing bank deposit account in order to mitigate the risk of being deemed an unregistered investment company. Our management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that we will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. We must complete one or more initial Business Combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80 of the net assets held in the Trust Account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes and excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial Business Combination. However, we will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50 or more of the voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We provide our Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholders meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion. The Public Shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then held in the Trust Account. The per-share amount to be distributed to Public Shareholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriter. We initially had 15 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, or January 4, 2024, to consummate an initial Business Combination. On January 2, 2024, the Company held a Special Meeting. At the Special Meeting, the Company s shareholders approved an amendment of the Company s Charter to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a Business Combination up to twenty-three (23) times for an additional one (1) month each time, with the first Extension Period being from January 4, 2024 to January 29, 2024, and each subsequent Extension Period being one calendar month each time, until up to December 29, 2025, only if the Sponsor or its designee would deposit into the Trust Account as a loan, (i) on or before January 4, 2024, with respect to the initial extension, an amount of 41,667, and (ii) one business day following the public announcement by us disclosing that the board of directors has determined to implement an additional monthly extension, with respect to each such Additional Extension, an amount of 50,000. In connection with the shareholder approval of the Extension, an aggregate of 3,980,414 Public Shares were redeemed, and the Company paid approximately 42.0 million accordingly on January 4, 2024.

At the Special Meeting, the Company s shareholders also approved proposals to (1) amend the Charter to provide for the right of a holder of Class B Shares to convert its Class B Shares into Class A Shares on a one-for-one basis at any time and from time to time at the election of the holder; (2) amend the Charter to eliminate from the Charter (i) the limitation that we may not redeem Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than 5,000,001 and (ii) the limitation that we shall not consummate a Business Combination unless we have net tangible assets of at least 5,000,001; (3) amend the Charter to permit the board of directors, in its sole discretion, to elect to wind up our operations on an earlier date than the Extended Date or Additional Extended Date, as applicable, as determined by the board of directors and included in a public announcement; and (4) amend the Investment Management Trust Agreement to reflect the Extension and the Liquidation Amendment. In connection with the approval of the Extension, our Sponsor, its affiliates, or its designees are required to deposit into the Trust Account, as a loan, (i) on or before January 4, 2024, with respect to the Initial Extension, an amount of 41,667, and (ii) one business day following the public announcement by us disclosing that the board of directors has determined to implement an additional monthly extension, with respect to each such Additional Extension, an amount of 50,000. In connection with the Contribution and advances our Sponsor may make in the future to us for working capital expenses, on January 2, 2024, we issued a convertible promissory note to Harry L. You, our Chairman and Chief Financial Officer and an affiliate of our Sponsor, with a principal amount up to 1.75 million. The Convertible Note bears no interest and is repayable on the earlier of: (i) the date on which we consummate an initial Business Combination and (ii) the liquidation date. If we do not consummate a Business Combination before the end of the Combination Period, the Convertible Note will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. Upon the consummation of our initial Business Combination, the outstanding principal of the Convertible Note may be converted into warrants, at a price of 1.00 per warrant, at the option of the Payee. Since January 2, 2024, our board of directors has elected to extend our liquidation date to November 29, 2024. Accordingly, we have drawn down from the Convertible Note and deposited 541,667 into the Trust Account in connection with such extensions. If we are unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter subject to lawfully available funds therefor, redeem one hundred percent (100 of the Offering Shares in consideration of a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest not previously released to the Company to pay its taxes (less up to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), by (B) the total number of then outstanding Offering Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish rights of the Public Shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the board of directors in accordance with applicable law, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under the MBCA to provide for claims of creditors and other requirements of applicable law. Liquidity and Capital Resources; Going Concern Consideration As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 385,000 in cash and working capital deficit of approximately 2.2 million. Further, the Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its acquisition plans. Prior to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, our liquidity needs were satisfied through the payment of 25,000 from our Sponsor to purchase Founder Shares and a loan under the Note in the amount of approximately 145,000. We fully repaid the Note balance on October 4, 2022. The Note was no longer available to us after closing of our Initial Public Offering. Subsequent to the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Partial Over-Allotment, our liquidity needs have been satisfied through the net proceeds from the consummation of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement held outside of the Trust Account and advances from related parties (approximately 228,000 outstanding as of September 30, 2024). Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we borrowed an additional amount of approximately 117,000 from related parties, increasing the total outstanding amount of advances to approximately 345,000.

In addition, in order to provide the Contribution and to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Company issued the Convertible Note to an affiliate of the Sponsor with a principal amount up to 1.75 million on January 2, 2024 as discussed above. We borrowed 491,667 under the Convertible Note from January through September 2024, and an additional amount of 50,000 in October 2024, increasing the total amount outstanding under the Convertible Note to 541,667. All proceeds received under the Convertible Note were contributed into the Trust Account in connection with extensions to extend the Combination Period to November 29, 2024. In connection with our management s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with FASB s ASU 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, our management has determined that the liquidity condition, mandatory liquidation, should a Business Combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern through the earlier of the liquidation date or the completion of the initial Business Combination. There is no assurance that our plans to consummate the initial Business Combination will be successful or successful within the Combination Period. These unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Risks and Uncertainties United States and global markets are experiencing volatility and disruption following the geopolitical instability resulting from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and the recent escalation of the Israel-Hamas conflict. In response to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO deployed additional military forces to eastern Europe, and the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and other countries have announced various sanctions and restrictive actions against Russia, Belarus and related individuals and entities, including the removal of certain financial institutions from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication SWIFT payment system. Certain countries, including the United States, have also provided and may continue to provide military aid or other assistance to Ukraine and to Israel, increasing geopolitical tensions among a number of nations. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the escalation of the Israel-Hamas conflict and the resulting measures that have been taken, and could be taken in the future, by NATO, the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Israel and its neighboring states and other countries have created global security concerns that could have a lasting impact on regional and global economies. Although the length and impact of the ongoing conflicts are highly unpredictable, they could lead to market disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices, credit and capital markets, as well as supply chain interruptions and increased cyber-attacks against U.S. companies. Additionally, any resulting sanctions could adversely affect the global economy and financial markets and lead to instability and lack of liquidity in capital markets. Any of the above mentioned factors, or any other negative impact on the global economy, capital markets or other geopolitical conditions resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the escalation of the Israel-Hamas conflict and subsequent sanctions or related actions, could adversely affect the Company s search for an initial Business Combination and any target business with which the Company may ultimately consummate an initial Business Combination. Results of Operations Our entire activity from February 15, 2022 (inception) through September 30, 2024 is related to our formation and the preparation for our Initial Public Offering, and since the closing of our Initial Public Offering, the search for a prospective initial Business Combination. We will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial Business Combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of investment income from the Trust Account. We will continue to incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. Additionally, we recognize non-cash gains and losses within other income (expense) related to changes in recurring fair value measurement of our derivative liabilities at each reporting period. 
 25 

Table of Contents 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had net income of approximately 146,000, which consisted of approximately 242,000 of gain from change in fair value of the derivative warrant liabilities, approximately 335,000 of interest income from operating account and investments held in the Trust Account, partially offset by approximately 185,000 of general and administrative expenses (of which 30,000 was for administrative expenses paid to our Sponsor) and approximately 246,000 of tax expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net loss of approximately 344,000, which consisted of approximately 793,000 of general and administrative expenses (of which 90,000 was for administrative expenses paid to our Sponsor) and approximately 798,000 of tax expenses, partially offset by approximately 1.0 million of interest income from operating account and investments held in the Trust Account and approximately 242,000 of gain from change in fair value of the derivative warrant liabilities. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had net loss of approximately 73,000, which consisted of approximately 241,000 of general and administrative expenses (of which 30,000 was for administrative expenses paid to our Sponsor), approximately 161,000 in tax expenses, and approximately 544,000 of the change in fair value of the derivative warrant liabilities, partially offset by approximately 873,000 of interest income from operating account and investments held in Trust Account. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had net income of approximately 1.6 million, which consisted of approximately 967,000 of the change in fair value of the derivative warrant liabilities and approximately 2.2 million of interest income from operating account and investments held in Trust Account, partially offset by approximately 982,000 of general and administrative expenses (of which 90,000 was for administrative expenses paid to our Sponsor) and approximately 565,000 of tax expenses. Contractual Obligations Administrative Services Agreement On October 4, 2022, we entered into an agreement pursuant to which we agreed to pay our Sponsor 10,000 per month for office space, administrative and support services. Upon completion of a Business Combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. We recorded 30,000 and 90,000, respectively, in connection with such fees during each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 in the accompanying unaudited condensed statements of operations. We recorded an outstanding balance of 160,000 and 70,000 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively in connection with such fees in accrued expenses in the accompanying unaudited condensed balance sheets. Our Sponsor, executive officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable Business Combinations. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our Sponsor, executive officers or directors, or our or their affiliates. Registration Rights The holders of Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans and the Contributions (and any shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants or warrants issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans and the Contributions and upon conversion of the Founder Shares and the Overfunding Loans), will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration and shareholder rights agreement signed upon the consummation of the Initial Public Offering. These holders will be entitled to certain demand and piggyback registration rights. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. Underwriting Agreement The underwriter was entitled to an underwriting discount of 0.14 per unit, or approximately 0.8 million in the aggregate, paid upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering. An additional fee of 0.35 per unit, or 2.1 million in the aggregate will be payable to the underwriter for deferred underwriting commissions. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriter from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that we complete a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. 
 26 

Table of Contents 

The underwriter was entitled to an additional fee of approximately 45,000, which was paid upon closing of the over-allotment option, and approximately 112,000 in deferred underwriting commissions in connection with the consummation of the underwriter s partial exercise of its over-allotment option. Overfunding Loans Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor extended the Overfunding Loan to the Company in an aggregate amount of 900,000. On October 11, 2022, simultaneously with the sale of the Over-Allotment Units, the Sponsor extended the Additional Overfunding Loan to the Company in an amount of 47,850, for an aggregate outstanding principal amount of 947,850 to be deposited in the Trust Account. Upon the closing of the initial Business Combination, the Overfunding Loans will be repaid or converted into Class A Shares at a conversion price of 10.00 per share (or a combination of both), at the Sponsor s discretion. If the Company does not complete an initial Business Combination, it will not repay the Overfunding Loans from amounts held in the Trust Account, and its proceeds will be distributed to the Public Shareholders; however, the Company may repay the Overfunding Loans if there are funds available outside the Trust Account to do so. Convertible Promissory Note In connection with the Contribution and advances our Sponsor may make in the future to our Company for working capital expenses, on January 2, 2024, we issued a Convertible Note to an affiliate of our Sponsor with a principal amount up to 1.75 million. The Convertible Note bears no interest and is repayable in full upon the earlier of (a) the date of the consummation of our initial Business Combination, or (b) the date of our liquidation. If we do not consummate an initial Business Combination by the end of the Combination Period, the Convertible Note will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. Upon the consummation of our initial Business Combination, the outstanding principal of the Convertible Note may be converted into warrants, at a price of 1.00 per warrant, at the option of the Sponsor. Such warrants will have terms identical to the Private Placement Warrants. We borrowed 491,667 under the Convertible Note through September 2024, and an additional amount of 50,000 in October 2024, increasing the total amount outstanding under the Convertible Note to 541,667. All proceeds received under the Convertible Note were contributed into the Trust Account in connection with extensions to extend the Combination Period to November 29, 2024. The option to convert the Convertible Note into warrants qualifies as an embedded derivative under ASC 815 and is required to be recognized at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in our statements of operations each reporting period until the Convertible Note is repaid or converted. As of the funding date and September 30, 2024, the fair value of the embedded conversion option had a de minimis value. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the unaudited condensed financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed financial statements, and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies: Warrant Liabilities The warrants issued in connection with Public Warrants and the Private Placement Warrants were recognized as derivative liabilities in accordance with ASC 815. Accordingly, we recognized the warrant instruments as liabilities at fair value and will adjust the instruments to fair value at each reporting period. The liabilities are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value will be recognized in the 
 27 

Table of Contents 

statements of operations. The fair value of the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants were initially measured at fair value using the Black-Scholes model and the Monte Carlo simulation model, respectively. Beginning in December 2022, the fair value of Public Warrants has been measured based on the listed market price of such Public Warrants. The estimated fair value of the Private Placement Warrants was subsequently determined using the Monte Carlo simulation method with Level 3 inputs. The determination of the fair value of the derivative warrant liabilities may be subject to change as more current information becomes available and accordingly the actual results could differ significantly. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(b)(1) of Regulation S-K and did not have any commitments or contractual obligations. JOBS Act On April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act and are allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We elected to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. As an emerging growth company , we are not required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our Initial Public Offering or until we are no longer an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness, of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that during the period covered by this Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 covered by this Report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings None. Item 1A. Risk Factors Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this Report are any of the risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. As of the date of this Report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds On March 16, 2022, we issued to our Sponsor an aggregate of 2,875,000 Founder Shares for a total purchase price of 25,000, or approximately 0.009 per share. On September 8, 2022, our Sponsor surrendered to us 718,750 Founder Shares for no consideration, resulting in our Sponsor owning 2,156,250 Founder Shares and increasing the approximate price paid per Founder Share to 0.012. On September 29, 2022, our Sponsor surrendered to us an additional 431,250 Founder Shares for no consideration, resulting in our Sponsor owning 1,725,000 Founder Shares and increasing the approximate price paid per Founder Share to 0.015. On October 7, 2022, the underwriter exercised its over-allotment option in part, and on October 11, 2022, the underwriter purchased 319,000 Over-Allotment Units, generating gross proceeds of approximately 3.2 million. The underwriter waived the remainder of its over-allotment option. Accordingly, the Sponsor forfeited 145,250 Founder Shares on October 11, 2022. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to such sales of Founder Shares. This issuance was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. On October 4, 2022, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 6,000,000 units at a price of 10.00 per unit, generating net proceeds to the Company of 59,135,000 (after giving effect to the reimbursement of certain of the Company s expenses and the upfront portion of the underwriter s discount, equal to 0.14 per unit). The securities sold in our Initial Public Offering were registered under the Securities Act on a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-267381). The SEC declared the registration statement effective on September 29, 2022. Simultaneously with the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, we completed an Initial Private Placement of an aggregate of 2,840,000 Initial Private Placement Warrants to our Sponsor at a purchase price of 1.00 per Initial Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds of 8,840,000. On October 11, 2022, simultaneously with the sale of the underwriter s Over-Allotment Units, the Company completed an Additional Private Placement with our Sponsor for 44,660 Additional Private Placement Warrants at a price of 1.00 per Additional Private Placement Warrant, generating proceeds to the Company of 44,660. In addition, concurrently with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, our Sponsor extended an Initial Overfunding Loan to the Company in the amount of 900,000 at no interest, to be deposited in the Trust Account. On October 11, 2022, simultaneously with the sale of the Over-Allotment Units, our Sponsor extended an Additional Overfunding Loan to the Company in an aggregate amount of 47,850, to be deposited in the Trust Account. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to the Private Placement or Overfunding Loans. These issuances were made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.

 Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Private Placement and the Overfunding Loans, approximately 64.1 million 10.15 per unit) of the net proceeds of the sale of the units, Over-Allotment Units, and the Private Placement Warrants and the proceeds from the Overfunding Loans were placed in the Trust Account.
