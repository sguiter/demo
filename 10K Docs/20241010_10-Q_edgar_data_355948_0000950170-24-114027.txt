RICHARDSON ELECTRONICS, LTD. 
 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLI DATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 of our products are manufactured at our facilities located in LaFox, Illinois, Marlborough, Massachusetts and Donaueschingen, Germany, or by one of our manufacturing partners throughout the world. We serve customers in the alternative energy, healthcare, aviation, broadcast, communications, industrial, marine, medical, military, scientific and semiconductor markets. The Company s strategy is to provide specialized technical expertise and engineered solutions based on our core engineering and manufacturing capabilities. The Company provides solutions and adds value through design-in support, systems integration, prototype design and manufacturing, testing, logistics and aftermarket technical service and repair through its global infrastructure. Our products include electron tubes and related components, microwave generators, subsystems used in semiconductor manufacturing and visual technology solutions. These products are used to control, switch or amplify electrical power signals, or are used as display devices in a variety of industrial, commercial, medical and communication applications. The Company reports its financial performance for the following business segments: Power and Microwave Technologies ("PMT"), Green Energy Solutions ("GES"), Canvys and Healthcare. A description of the Company's business segments is provided in Note 10, Segment and Geographic Information. We currently operate within the following major geographic regions: North America, Asia/Pacific, Europe and Latin America. 

 operating and reportable segments. The financial information contained in this report should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 1, 2024, which was filed with the SEC on August 5, 2024.

million of finished goods, million of raw materials and million of work-in-progress as of August 31, 2024, as compared to approximately million of finished goods, million of raw materials and million of work-in-progress as of June 1, 2024. Provisions for obsolete or slow-moving inventories are recorded based upon regular analysis of stock rotation privileges, obsolescence, the exiting of certain markets and assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Inventory reserves were approximately million as of August 31, 2024 and million as of June 1, 2024. Revenue Recognition: Our customers are generally not resellers, but rather businesses that incorporate our products into their processes, from which they generate an economic benefit. The goods are also distinct in that each item sold to the customer is clearly identified on both the purchase order and resulting invoice. Each product we sell benefits the customer independently of the other products. Each item on each purchase order from the customer can be used by the customer unrelated to any other products we provide to the customer. Revenue is recognized when control transfers since it is not always based on delivery of the goods. The Company s revenue includes the following streams: Manufacturing/assembly 

 Distribution 

 Services revenue 

 Manufacturing/assembly typically includes the products that are manufactured or assembled in our manufacturing facility. These products can either be built to the customer s prints/designs or are products that we stock in our warehouse to sell to any customer that places an order. The manufacturing business does not include a separate service bundled with the product sold or sold in addition to the product. Our contracts for customized products generally include termination provisions if a customer cancels its order. However, we recognize revenue at a point in time because the termination provisions normally do not require, upon cancellation, the customer to pay fees that are commensurate with the work performed. Each purchase order explicitly states the goods or services that we promise to transfer to the customer. The promises to the customer are limited only to those goods or services. The performance obligation is our promise to deliver both goods that were produced by the Company and resale of goods that we purchase from our suppliers. Our shipping and handling activities for destination shipments are performed prior to the customer obtaining control. As such, they are not a separate promised service. The Company elects to account for shipping and handling as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the goods. The goods we provide to our customers are distinct in that our customers benefit from the goods we sell them through use in their own processes. Distribution typically includes products purchased from our suppliers, stocked in our warehouses and then sold to our customers. The distribution business does not include a separate service bundled with the product sold or sold on top of the product. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers, which is simultaneous with the title transferring to the customer, in an amount that reflects the transaction price consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods. Control refers to the ability of the customer to direct the use of and obtain substantially all the remaining benefits from the goods. Our transaction price consideration is fixed, unless otherwise disclosed below as variable consideration. Generally, our contracts require our customers to pay for goods after we deliver products to them. Terms are generally on open account, payable net 30 days in North America, and vary throughout Asia/Pacific, Europe and Latin America subject to customary credit checks. 

7 

of the Company s total revenues and is expected to continue at that level. Contracts with customers: A revenue contract exists once a customer purchase order is received, reviewed and accepted. Each accepted purchase order identifies a distinct good or service as the Company's performance obligation. The goods include standard products purchased from a supplier and stocked on our shelves, customized products purchased from a supplier, products that are customized or have value added to them in house prior to shipping to the customer and manufactured products. Prior to accepting a customer purchase order, we review the credit worthiness of the customer. Purchase orders are deemed to meet the collectability criterion once the customer s credit is approved. The Company receives advance payments or deposits from our customers before revenue is recognized resulting in contract liabilities. Contract liabilities are included in accrued liabilities in the unaudited consolidated balance sheets. 

Contract liabilities 

During the three months ended August 31, 2024 and September 2, 2023, the Company recognized million and million, respectively, of revenue upon satisfaction of performance obligations related to amounts that were included in the contract liabilities balance as of June 1, 2024 and May 27, 2023, respectively. See Note 10, Segment Geographic Information for a disaggregation of revenue by reportable segment and geographic region, which represents how our chief operating decision maker reviews information internally to evaluate our financial performance and to make resource allocation and other decisions for the Company.

Revolving Credit Facility with PNC Bank N.A. on March 20, 2023 (the "Revolving Credit Facility"). The Revolving Credit Facility will mature on . Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, including the swingline loan and letter of credit sub-facility extended to the Company thereunder, are secured by (i) a continuing first priority lien on and security interest in and to substantially all of the assets of the Company and its domestic subsidiaries and (ii) a continuing first priority pledge of the Pledged Collateral of the Company and the Guarantors identified in the Security Agreement and the Pledge Agreement executed in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility. The combined maximum borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are million. Proceeds of borrowings may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.

million and million for the first three months of fiscal 2025 and the first three months of fiscal 2024, respectively. The effective income tax rate during the first three months of fiscal 2025 was a tax provision of as compared to a tax provision of during the first three months of fiscal 2024. The difference in rate during the first three months of fiscal 2025 as compared to the first three months of fiscal 2024 reflects changes in our geographical distribution of income (loss), which is primarily driven by a decrease in U.S. earnings for fiscal 2025 and the state income tax provision, as well as an increase in the utilization of U.S. research and development credits. The effective income tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of as a result of our geographical distribution of income (loss), as well as the utilization of U.S. research and development credits. In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. Years prior to fiscal 2015 are closed for examination under the statute of limitation for U.S. federal and U.S. state. In the Netherlands, years prior to fiscal 2019 are closed for examination. We are under examination in Germany for fiscal years 2019 to 2022. We have no current open audits in the U.S. We have historically determined that undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, to the extent of cash available, will be repatriated to the U.S. The deferred tax liabilities on the outside basis difference is now primarily withholding tax on future dividend distributions. The deferred tax liabilities related to undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries was less than million as of August 31, 2024 and June 1, 2024. The Company recorded a million liability for uncertain tax positions as of August 31, 2024. The uncertain tax positions totaled million as of June 1, 2024. We record interest related to uncertain tax positions in the income tax expense line item within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Accrued interest was included within the related tax liability line in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have recorded a liability of less than million for interest and penalties as it relates to the reserve of the research and development credit as of June 1, 2024 and August 31, 2024, respectively. The Company maintains a valuation allowance representing the portion of the deferred tax asset that management does not believe is more likely than not to be realized. The valuation allowance was million as of August 31, 2024 and was million as of September 2, 2023. The current valuation allowance is recorded on deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions where historical taxable losses have been incurred million) and state NOLs million). The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are increased, or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth. 

 shares of common stock and shares of Class B common stock. The Class B common stock has votes per share and has transferability restrictions; however, Class B common stock may be converted into common stock on a share-for-share basis at any time. With respect to dividends and distributions, shares of common stock and Class B common stock rank equally and have the same rights, except that Class B common stock cash dividends are limited to of the amount of common stock cash dividends. Our Class B common stock is considered a participating security requiring the use of the two-class method for the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share. The two-class computation method for each period reflects the cash dividends paid per share for each class of stock, plus the amount of allocated undistributed (loss) earnings per share computed using the participation percentage which reflects the dividend rights of each class of stock. Basic and diluted earnings per share were computed using the two-class method. The shares of Class B common stock are considered to be participating convertible securities since the shares of Class B common stock are convertible on a share-for-share basis into shares of common stock and may participate in dividends with common stock according to a predetermined formula which is 90 of the amount of common stock cash dividends. The allocation of undistributed (loss) earnings between common stock and Class B common stock is based on the relationship of the weighted shares outstanding for the respective stock class (common or Class B) to the total of the weighted shares outstanding for common stock and 90 of the weighted shares outstanding for Class B common stock. The adjustment to the number of outstanding Class B common stock shares reflects the limitation of Class B common stock dividends to 90 of common stock dividends.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Certain statements in this report may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The terms may, should, could, anticipate," believe, continue, estimate, expect, intend, objective, plan, potential," project and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. These statements are based on management s current expectations, intentions or beliefs and are subject to a number of factors, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences or that might otherwise impact the business include; economic, labor and political conditions; global business disruption caused by the Russian - Ukraine and Israel - Hamas wars; currency exchange fluctuations; and the ability of the Company to manage its growth and the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on August 5, 2024. We undertake no obligation to update any such factor or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
 In addition, while we do, from time to time, communicate with securities analysts, it is against our policy to disclose to them or any outside third party, any material non-public information or other confidential commercial information. Accordingly, stockholders should not assume that we agree with any statement or report issued by any securities analyst or outside third party, irrespective of the content of the statement or report. Thus, to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections, forecasts or opinions, such reports are not our responsibility. 
 INTRODUCTION 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A is intended to assist the reader in better understanding our business, results of operations, financial condition, changes in financial condition and significant developments. MD A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this filing. This section is organized as follows: 
 Business Overview 

Results of Operations an analysis and comparison of our consolidated results of operations for the three month periods ended August 31, 2024, and September 2, 2023, as reflected in our unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 

Liquidity, Financial Position and Capital Resources a discussion of our primary sources and uses of cash for the three month periods ended August 31, 2024 and September 2, 2023, and a discussion of changes in our financial position. 

Business Overview 
 Richardson Electronics, Ltd. (the "Company," "we," "our") is a leading global manufacturer of engineered solutions, power grid and microwave tubes and related consumables; power conversion and RF and microwave components; high-value replacement parts, tubes and service training for diagnostic imaging equipment; and customized display solutions. Nearly 50 of our products are manufactured at our facilities located in LaFox, Illinois, Marlborough, Massachusetts and Donaueschingen, Germany, or by one of our manufacturing partners throughout the world. We serve customers in the alternative energy, healthcare, aviation, broadcast, communications, industrial, marine, medical, military, scientific and semiconductor markets. The Company s strategy is to provide specialized technical expertise and engineered solutions based on our core engineering and manufacturing capabilities. The Company provides solutions and adds value through design-in support, systems integration, prototype design and manufacturing, testing, logistics and aftermarket technical service and repair through its global infrastructure. 
 Some of the Company's products are manufactured in China and imported into the United States. The Office of the United States Trade Representative ("USTR") instituted tariffs on the importation of a number of products into the United States from China. These tariffs are a response to what the USTR considers to be certain unfair trade practices by China. A number of the Company's products manufactured in China are subject to duties when imported into the United States. 
 Management continues to work with its suppliers as well as its customers to mitigate the impact of the tariffs on our customers. However, if the Company is unable to successfully pass through the additional cost of these tariffs, or if the higher prices reduce demand for the Company's products, it will have a negative effect on the Company's sales and gross margins. 
 15 

We currently operate within the following major geographic regions: North America, Asia/Pacific, Europe and Latin America.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, consolidated net sales increased 2.2 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Sales for PMT decreased 4.3 , sales for GES increased 84.0 , sales for Canvys decreased 22.8 and sales for Healthcare increased 48.7 . The decrease in PMT was mainly due to slower sales of electron devices slightly offset by growth in our Wafer Fab and RF and Microwave component businesses. The increase in GES was mainly due to increased shipments of power management products focused on battery modules for wind turbine and electric locomotive products. The decrease in Canvys was attributable to lower sales in the North American and European markets. The increase in Healthcare reflected higher sales in all product lines.

Gross profit reflects the distribution and manufacturing product margin less manufacturing variances, inventory obsolescence charges, customer returns, scrap and cycle count adjustments, engineering costs and other provisions. 
 Consolidated gross profit decreased to 16.4 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 17.3 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Consolidated gross margin as a percentage of net sales during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 decreased to 30.6 when compared to 32.8 during the first quarter of fiscal 2024. This decrease was mainly due to the unfavorable product mix and manufacturing under absorption in PMT and unfavorable product mix in GES with a partial offset from the favorable product mix in Canvys and cost efficiencies in scrap and freight in Healthcare. 
 17 

Power and Microwave Technologies 
 PMT net sales decreased 4.3 to 34.2 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 35.7 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease was mainly due to slower sales of electron devices slightly offset by growth in our Wafer Fab and RF and Microwave component businesses. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 29.8 during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared to 32.2 during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 due to unfavorable product mix and manufacturing under absorption. 
 Green Energy Solutions 
 GES net sales increased 84.0 to 8.1 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 4.4 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase reflected the project-based nature of this segment and was mainly due to increased shipments of power management products focused on battery modules for wind turbine and electric locomotive products. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 29.4 during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared to 36.0 during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 due to product mix. 
 Canvys 
 Canvys net sales decreased 22.8 to 7.6 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 9.9 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2024, due to lower sales in both the North American and European markets. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 34.3 during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 34.0 during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 primarily due to improved product mix. 
 Healthcare 
 Healthcare net sales increased 48.7 to 3.8 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 2.6 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 due to increases in all Healthcare product lines. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 32.4 during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared to 31.6 during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 primarily due to cost efficiencies in scrap and freight. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses SG A increased slightly to 16.1 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 when compared to 15.8 million for the year ago quarter. This increase of 2.0 from the first quarter of fiscal 2024 mainly reflected higher incentives due to sales growth. Expressed as a percentage of net sales, SG A was 30.0 for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and remained unchanged compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 Other Income/Expense 
 Other income was 0.3 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to other income of 0.1 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Other income during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 included interest income and foreign exchange gains. Our foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily due to the translation of U.S. dollars held in non-U.S. entities. We currently do not utilize derivative instruments to manage our exposure to foreign currency. 
 Income Tax Provision 
 We recorded an income tax provision of 0.1 million and 0.4 million for the first three months of fiscal 2025 and the first three months of fiscal 2024, respectively. The effective income tax rate during the first three months of fiscal 2025 was a tax provision of 9.0 as compared to a tax provision of 23.7 during the first three months of fiscal 2024. The difference in rate during the first three months of fiscal 2025 as compared to the first three months of fiscal 2024 reflects changes in our geographical distribution of income (loss), which is primarily driven by a decrease in U.S. earnings for fiscal 2025 and the state income tax provision, as well as an increase in the utilization of U.S. research and development credits. The 9.0 effective income tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21 as a result of our geographical distribution of income (loss), as well as the utilization of U.S. research and development credits. 
 In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. Years prior to fiscal 2015 are closed for examination under the statute of limitation for U.S. federal and U.S. state. In the Netherlands, years prior to fiscal 2019 are closed for examination. We are under examination in Germany for fiscal years 2019 to 2022. We have no current open audits in the U.S. 
 18 

The Company recorded a 0.3 million liability for uncertain tax positions as of August 31, 2024. The uncertain tax positions totaled 0.1 million as of June 1, 2024. We record interest related to uncertain tax positions in the income tax expense line item within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Accrued interest was included within the related tax liability line in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have recorded a liability of less than 0.1 million for interest and penalties as it relates to the reserve of the research and development credit as of June 1, 2024 and August 31, 2024, respectively. 
 Net Income and Per Share Data 
 Net income during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was 0.6 million, or 0.04 per diluted common share and 0.04 per Class B diluted common share as compared to net income of 1.2 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 or 0.09 per diluted common share and 0.08 per Class B diluted common share. 
 19 

LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Our operations and cash needs have been primarily financed through income from operations and cash on hand. 
 Cash and cash equivalents were 23.0 million at August 31, 2024. Cash and cash equivalents by geographic area at August 31, 2024 consisted of 4.1 million in North America, 9.9 million in Europe, 1.2 million in Latin America and 7.8 million in Asia/Pacific. No cash was repatriated to the United States in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Although the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act generally eliminated federal income tax on future cash repatriation to the United States, cash repatriation may be subject to state and local taxes, withholding or similar taxes. See Note 8, Income Taxes , of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 1, 2024, filed with the SEC on August 5, 2024, for further information. 
 Cash and cash equivalents were 24.3 million at June 1, 2024. Cash and cash equivalents by geographic area at June 1, 2024 consisted of 7.1 million in North America, 7.3 million in Europe, 1.1 million in Latin America and 8.8 million in Asia/Pacific. We repatriated 0.3 million to the United States in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 from our entity in Mexico. 
 Our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements primarily arise from: (i) working capital requirements, (ii) capital expenditure needs and (iii) cash dividend payments (if and when declared by our Board of Directors). Our ability to fund these requirements will depend, in part, on our future cash flows, which are determined by our future operating performance and, therefore, subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. 
 Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that the existing sources of liquidity, including current cash, will provide sufficient resources to meet known capital requirements and working capital needs through the next twelve months. Additionally, while our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, the economy and the outlook for growth in our markets, we believe our existing sources of liquidity as well as our ability to generate operating cash flows will satisfy our future obligations and cash requirements. 
 On March 20, 2023, the Company established a senior, secured revolving credit facility agreement with a three-year term in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed 30 million, including a swingline loan and a letter of credit sub-facility (collectively, the "Revolving Credit Facility") with PNC Bank. The Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by the Company's domestic subsidiaries. Proceeds of the borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are expected to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company utilized 1.0 million of the credit line to address short-term cash requirements and repaid that 1.0 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2025. As of the end of the first quarter for fiscal 2025 and the date of this report, no amounts were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Cash flows from operating activities are primarily a result of our net income adjusted for non-cash items and changes in our operating assets and liabilities. 
 Operating activities generated 0.4 million of cash during the first three months of fiscal 2025. We had a net income of 0.6 million during the first three months of fiscal 2025, which included non-cash stock-based compensation expense of 0.6 million associated with the issuance of stock option and restricted stock awards, inventory reserve provisions of 0.1 million, unrealized foreign exchange gain of 0.4 million and depreciation and amortization expense of 1.0 million associated with our property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities used 1.9 million in cash during the first three months of fiscal 2025, net of foreign currency exchange gains and losses included an increase in inventory of 0.1 million and an increase in accounts receivable of 5.9 million. Partially offsetting the cash utilization was an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 4.1 million. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the higher level of sales for the current quarter compared to the prior quarter. The changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities were timing related. 
 Operating activities generated 1.0 million of cash during the first three months of fiscal 2024. We had a net income of 1.2 million during the first three months of fiscal 2024, which included non-cash stock-based compensation expense of 0.5 million associated with the issuance of stock option and restricted stock awards, inventory reserve provisions of 0.1 million and depreciation and amortization expense of 1.0 million associated with our property and equipment as well as amortization of our intangible assets. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities used 1.8 million in cash during the first three months of fiscal 2024, net of foreign currency exchange gains and losses included an increase in inventory of 3.2 million, a decrease in accounts payable of 2.4 million and a decrease in accrued liabilities of 1.1 million. Partially offsetting the cash utilization were decreases in receivables of 4.5 million and prepayments of 0.4 million. The decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to the lower level of sales in the current quarter. Most of the inventory increase supported the products for electron tubes and Healthcare. The decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities were timing related. 
 20 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Cash used in investing activities of 0.9 million during the first three months of fiscal 2025 was due to capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were primarily related to our IT system and LaFox manufacturing and facilities. LaFox manufacturing primarily supports the Electron Device Group ("EDG") and Green Energy Solutions ("GES"). 
 Cash used in investing activities of 1.1 million during the first three months of fiscal 2024 was due to capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were primarily related to our IT system and the LaFox manufacturing and facilities renovation. LaFox manufacturing primarily supports the Electron Device Group ("EDG") and Green Energy Solutions ("GES"). 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Cash flows used in financing activities consist primarily of cash dividends and cash flows provided by financing activities consist primarily of the proceeds from the issuance of stock. All future dividend payments are at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Dividend payments depend on earnings, capital requirements, operating conditions and such other factors that the Board may deem relevant. 
 Cash used in financing activities of 0.9 million during the first three months of fiscal 2025 primarily resulted from 0.9 million of dividend payments to stockholders partially offset by 0.1 million of proceeds from the issuance of stock. 
 Cash used by financing activities of 0.6 million during the first three months of fiscal 2024 primarily resulted from 0.8 million of dividend payments to stockholders offset by 0.3 million of proceeds from the issuance of stock. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The Company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S GAAP. Preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company s most critical accounting policies and estimates are those most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations and which require the Company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Although management believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are based on information available when they are made and, therefore, may differ from estimates made under different assumptions or conditions. 
 The Company s significant accounting policies are consistent with those discussed in Note 3, Significant Accounting Policies and Disclosures , to the consolidated financial statements and the MD A section of the Company s fiscal 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K (the 2024 Annual Report ). During the three months ended August 31, 2024, there were no significant changes in the application of critical accounting policies. 
 Impact of New Accounting Standards

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Risk Management and Market Sensitive Financial Instruments 
 We are exposed to many different market risks with the various industries we serve. The primary financial risk we are exposed to is foreign currency exchange, as certain of our operations, assets and liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies. We manage these risks through normal operating and financing activities. 
 The interpretation and analysis of these disclosures should not be considered in isolation since such variances in exchange rates would likely influence other economic factors. Such factors, which are not readily quantifiable, would likely also affect our operations. Additional disclosure regarding various market risks is set forth in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 1, 2024 filed with the SEC on August 5, 2024. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Management of the Company, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of August 31, 2024. 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are intended to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Company s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
