 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was above the statutory rate of primarily due to a valuation allowance recorded against Westlake Epoxy Netherlands's net operating loss that included for the three months ended September 30, 2024 the expenses related to the plan to temporarily cease operations ("mothball") of the allyl chloride (AC) and epichlorohydrin (ECH) units in Pernis, the Netherlands (collectively, the "Units") and state and foreign taxes, partially offset by U.S. federal research and development credits available to the Company. The effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was below the statutory rate of primarily due to U.S. federal research and development credits available to the Company, partially offset by an increase in reserves for uncertain income tax positions. 
 The effective income tax rate was for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was above the statutory rate of primarily due to a valuation allowance recorded against Westlake Epoxy Netherlands's net operating loss which was due to, among other things, the expenses related to the mothballing of the Units and state and foreign taxes, partially offset by U.S. federal research and development credits available to the Company. The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was below the statutory rate of primarily due to U.S. federal research and development credits available to the Company and the reduction of reserves for uncertain income tax positions as a result of a closed federal income tax audit, which was partially offset by an increase in reserves for uncertain income tax positions. 
 On October 8, 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (the "OECD")/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting released a statement indicating that its members had agreed to a Two Pillar Solution to Address the Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy. Pillar One aims to reallocate a taxpayer's residual profits to the market jurisdictions with which the taxpayer has a nexus. Pillar Two aims to establish a minimum global tax rate of 15 , assessed through a top-up tax imposed on a country-by-country basis. Pillar One targets multinational companies with global annual revenue exceeding 20 billion and profit-to-revenue ratio of more than 10 . Based on the current threshold requirements, the Company does not expect to be subject to Pillar One. On December 20, 2021, the OECD released the Pillar Two model rules providing a framework for implementing a 15 minimum tax, also referred to as the Global Anti-Base Erosion ("GloBE") rules, on earnings of multinational companies with consolidated annual revenue exceeding 750 million. 
 On December 12, 2022, European Union (EU) member states agreed to adopt the 15 minimum tax under the Pillar Two model rules to be enacted into the member states' domestic tax laws by December 31, 2023, with an effective date beginning in 2024. As of September 30, 2024, a handful of EU member states have yet to comply. Outside of the EU, several other jurisdictions that the Company operates in have enacted legislation consistent with the GloBE rules, while other foreign countries continue to debate adoption and timing to adopt. The Company's global footprint includes operations within the EU, as well as other non-EU jurisdictions that have enacted GloBE related legislation, such as Canada, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, the UK and Switzerland. At this time, the Company anticipates qualifying for at least one safe harbor in the majority of jurisdictions in which it operates. For those jurisdictions where a safe harbor was not met, the impact is anticipated to be immaterial. The Company will continue to closely monitor Pillar Two developments and evaluate the potential impact to the Company as more foreign countries enact legislation, and as new information and guidance becomes available. The impacts of Pillar Two are recorded in 2024, the first year in which the rules take effect.

 in single damages from the defendants, in addition to treble damages and attorney's fees. The plaintiffs in the putative class for such indirect purchasers seek approximately in single damages from the defendants, in addition to treble damages (if permitted under applicable state law) and injunctive relief. In December 2023, the Court denied the direct purchaser plaintiffs' motion for class certification and the Second Circuit subsequently denied the direct purchaser plaintiffs' motion for an interlocutory appeal for that ruling. The Company recorded an estimated liability in the amount of in 2023 in connection with its entry into a settlement agreement with the direct purchaser plaintiffs. However, in June 2024, the Court declined preliminary approval of the settlement and rejected certification of a settlement class. As a result, the Company terminated the settlement agreement and reversed the recorded liability. In July 2024, the direct purchaser plaintiffs filed an amended motion for preliminary approval of the settlement, which the Court denied on October 29, 2024. The indirect purchaser plaintiffs' motion for class certification remains pending. Beginning in October 2020, similar class action proceedings were also filed in Canada before the Superior Court of Qu bec as well as before the Federal Court. These proceedings seek the certification or authorization of a class action on behalf of all residents of Canada who purchased caustic soda (including, in one of the cases, those who merely purchased products containing caustic soda) from October 1, 2015 through the present or such date deemed appropriate by the court. On December 10, 2021, the Superior Court of Qu bec stayed its proceedings until after a final certification decision is released in the Federal Court proceedings. At this time, the Company is not able to estimate the impact, if any, that these lawsuits could have on the Company's consolidated financial statements either in the current period or in future periods. 
 Ethylene Antitrust. The Company and other ethylene consumers were named as defendants in a civil lawsuit filed by Shell Chemical Europe B.V. ("SCE") in March 2023 in the District Court of Amsterdam, the Netherlands, following the European Commission Decision AT.40410 Ethylene from July 14, 2020. SCE is a producer of ethylene in the European market and the lawsuit alleges the defendants conspired to lower the purchase price for ethylene and ethylene derivatives by manipulating the monthly contract price. SCE initially sought declaratory relief. In October 2023, SCE amended its claim and is now seeking a judgment establishing that the Company and the co-defendants are jointly and severally liable for alleged damages in the amount of approximately million with interest compounding daily from January 1, 2020 and continuing until payment in full, as provided by Dutch law, resulting from artificially lowered prices for ethylene and ethylene derivatives during the specified period. SCE is also seeking reimbursement of costs related to the proceeding plus statutory interest. The Company and other ethylene consumers were also named as defendants in a civil lawsuit filed by Stichting Ethylene Claims ("Stichting") in November 2023 in the District Court of Amsterdam, the Netherlands, following the same European Commission decision. Stichting is a foundation under Dutch Law that claims to represent various parties asserting injury by the same alleged conduct of defendants, seeking a declaratory judgment establishing that the Company and other defendants are jointly and severally liable for an unspecified amount of damages. At this time, the Company is not able to estimate the impact, if any, that the SCE lawsuit and/or the Stichting lawsuit could have on the Company's consolidated financial statements either in the current period or in future periods.

The Company appealed the verdict and sought a stay of execution pending appeal on October 30, 2023. Oral argument took place in October 2024 and a ruling from the court is expected in 2025. 
 Petro 2 Flash Fire and EDC Storage Tank Explosion. In September 2021, shortly after the turnaround on Westlake Chemical OpCo LP's Petro 2 ethylene facility commenced, there was a flash fire at the quench tower of the Petro 2 facility. In January 2022, an ethylene dichloride storage tank exploded at one of the Company's Lake Charles, Louisiana complexes. Certain employees and contractors working on the sites at the time of the events were injured during these events and multiple lawsuits were filed against the Company. Final settlements totaling approximately in the aggregate were reached with all of the plaintiffs to fully resolve the lawsuits, and payment by the Company and the insurance carriers is complete. 
 Brazilian Contractual Indemnification Lawsuit . In July 2012, PPG Industries, Inc. ("PPG") entered into an agreement to separate various assets and liabilities of its commodity chemicals business, which were transferred to Eagle Spinco, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of PPG ("Eagle Spinco"). The separation and the post separation contractual relationship between PPG and Eagle Spinco are generally set forth in that certain Separation Agreement dated as of July 18, 2012, by and between PPG and Eagle Spinco (the "Separation Agreement"). In January 2013, Eagle Spinco merged with Georgia Gulf Corporation to create Axiall Corporation ("Axiall"), which the Company later acquired in August 2016. Eagle Spinco is currently a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Company.

 million (Brazilian real), plus a monetary adjustment and interest since April 3, 2006 (based on Selic), as well as for legal fees and a small procedural fine. The parties to the lawsuit are waiting on the trial court's Accounting Department to release the aggregate judgment amount. On June 14, 2024, PPG filed an appeal of the decision in the Amazonas Court of Appeals in Manaus, Brazil. The Amazonas Court of Appeals rejected PPG's request for a stay of the trial court proceeding in light of the appeal. There is no expected date for the Amazonas Court of Appeals to examine the merits of PPG's appeal. PPG asserts that the Company and certain of its subsidiaries are responsible for any judgment in the Di Gregorio lawsuit. 
 On May 17, 2024, Eagle Spinco filed a lawsuit against PPG in Delaware Superior Court seeking (1) damages relating to PPG's breach of the Separation Agreement and (2) a declaration that PPG is not entitled to indemnification for the lawsuit unless it engages in efforts to pursue relevant insurance claims and assigns to Eagle Spinco its rights to those claims. On August 13, 2024, Eagle Spinco voluntarily dismissed the Superior Court action without prejudice, given the parallel chancery action set forth below. 
 On June 13, 2024, PPG filed a lawsuit against the Company, Axiall and Eagle Spinco in Delaware Chancery Court. In this lawsuit, PPG generally asks the court to find that the defendants: (1) breached the Separation Agreement; (2) may not abandon the defense of the Lawsuit filed by Di Gregorio against PPG; (3) must endeavor to substitute themselves into the Lawsuit and remove PPG as named defendant; (4) must acknowledge that they are solely responsible for the liabilities and defense costs of the Lawsuit; and (5) must handle and resolve the Lawsuit without access to PPG's insurance rights. The Company is defending this litigation and has asserted its own counterclaims, based on allegations similar to those that were asserted against PPG in the Delaware Superior Court action. 
 At this time, the Company is not able to estimate the impact, if any, that the Delaware lawsuits and Eagle Spinco's contractual obligations related to the lawsuits could have on the Company's consolidated financial statements either in the current period or in future periods. 
 Environmental Contingencies. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling approximately and , respectively, most of which was classified as noncurrent liabilities. The Company's assessment of the potential impact of these environmental contingencies is subject to considerable uncertainty due to the complex, ongoing and evolving process of investigation and remediation, if necessary, of such environmental contingencies, and the potential for technological and regulatory developments.

 , with an estimated to in annual operation and maintenance ("O M") costs. In September 2018, the EPA published the Record of Decision ("ROD") for the site, formally selecting the preferred final and interim remedies outlined in the amended Proposed Plan. In October 2018, the EPA issued Special Notice letters to the PRPs for the remedial design phase of work under the ROD. In April 2019, the PRPs and the EPA entered into an administrative settlement agreement and order on consent for remedial design. In October 2019, the PRPs received special notice letters for the remedial action phase of work at the site. The Company, jointly with the other PRPs, submitted a good faith offer response in December 2019. On September 17, 2020, the EPA and the Department of Justice filed a proposed consent decree for the remedial action with the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky. On November 16, 2020, the Department of Justice filed a motion to approve and enter the consent decree. On January 28, 2021, the Court granted the unopposed motion to enter the consent decree, which became effective the same day. The Company's allocation of liability for remedial and O M costs at the Calvert City site, if any, is governed by a series of agreements between the Company, Goodrich and Avient. These agreements and the associated litigation are described below. 
 In connection with the 1990 and 1997 acquisitions of the Goodrich chemical manufacturing complex in Calvert City, Goodrich agreed to indemnify the Company for any liabilities related to preexisting contamination at the complex. For its part, the Company agreed to indemnify Goodrich for post-closing contamination caused by the Company's operations. The soil and groundwater at the complex, which does not include the Company's nearby PVC facility, had been extensively contaminated by Goodrich's operations. In 1993, Goodrich spun off the predecessor of Avient, and that predecessor assumed Goodrich's indemnification obligations relating to preexisting contamination. In 2003, litigation arose among the Company, Goodrich and Avient with respect to the allocation of the cost of remediating contamination at the site. The parties settled this litigation in December 2007 and the case was dismissed. In the settlement, the parties agreed that, among other things: (1) Avient would pay of the costs (with specified exceptions), net of recoveries or credits from third parties, incurred with respect to environmental issues at the Calvert City site from August 1, 2007 forward; and (2) either the Company or Avient might, from time to time in the future (but not more than once every five years), institute an arbitration proceeding to adjust that percentage. In May 2017, Avient filed a demand for arbitration. In this proceeding, Avient sought to readjust the percentage allocation of future costs and to recover approximately from the Company in reimbursement of previously paid remediation costs. The Company's cross demand for arbitration seeking unreimbursed remediation costs incurred during the relevant period was dismissed from the proceedings when Avient paid such costs in full at the beginning of the arbitration hearing. 
 On July 10, 2018, Avient sued the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky and sought to invalidate the arbitration provisions in the parties' 2007 settlement agreement and enjoin the arbitration it had initiated in 2017. On July 30, 2018, the district court refused to enjoin the arbitration and, on January 15, 2019, the court granted the Company's motion to dismiss Avient's suit. On February 13, 2019, Avient appealed those decisions to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The court of appeals issued an opinion and final order on September 6, 2019, affirming the district court. 
 The arbitration hearing began in August 2018 and concluded in December 2018. On May 22, 2019, the arbitration panel issued its final award. It determined that Avient was responsible for of the allocable costs at issue in the proceeding and that Avient would remain responsible for of the costs to operate the existing groundwater remedy at the Calvert City site. In August 2019, Avient filed a motion to vacate before the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky, seeking to invalidate the final award under the Federal Arbitration Act. On February 11, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky denied Avient's motion to vacate and affirmed the arbitration final award. Avient did not file a notice of appeal before the March 10, 2020 deadline to contest the court's decision. Accordingly, the final award was affirmed, and the arbitration proceeding is fully and finally resolved.

 , for which Avient claims the Company is totally liable. On September 30, 2023, the court issued an order denying without prejudice the parties' cross motions for summary judgment and set a 30-day deadline for the parties to refile and provide additional briefing on specific aspects of the arguments before the court. The parties each refiled and provided additional briefing by the deadline. On September 30, 2024 the court issued an order granting the Company's request for summary judgment. Avient requested that the arbitration proceeding remain stayed based on its intent to pursue an appeal of the district court's order on summary judgment.The Company disputes these claims and at this time, the Company believes it is unlikely that any remediation costs allocable to it would result in material expenditures in any individual reporting period. 
 Sulphur Brine Dome. The Company owns and operates salt solution-mining caverns at the Sulphur Brine Dome in Sulphur, Louisiana. The Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources (LDENR) issued Compliance Order No. IMD 2022-027 and several supplements to that order, the latest in October 2023, in response to pressure anomaly events in two of the Company's brine caverns. The brine caverns were not active, operating wells but under ongoing, post-operational monitoring requirements. The compliance order and supplements thereto have required the Company to undertake various activities related to response planning, monitoring, investigation and mitigation of potential impacts in the event of future cavern pressure anomalies or failures. Since December 2022, continuous brine injection has maintained cavern pressure while the Company continues to pursue active monitoring, studies, groundwater monitoring, modeling and other activities under the compliance order and supplements. In September 2023, the Office of Conservation issued an emergency declaration as a conservative step to ensure ample resources are available to the government in its response and management of the evolving circumstances at the Sulphur Dome. In June 2024, the Company's cavern experienced a pressure event. As a result, the cavern required increased rates of brine injection, which ultimately restored cavern pressure but leveled out at a higher injection rate to maintain cavern stability. Citing the recent pressure event, LDENR ordered the Company to begin construction of a dome-wide containment structure, the planning for which was already underway pursuant to the existing compliance order and supplements thereto. The capital costs and expenditures required to comply with the compliance orders and supplements have been and will continue to be incurred. In response to these orders, the Company reserved approximately in connection with monitoring wells and other remedial activities. At this time, the Company is unable to estimate the impact, if any, that other ongoing expenditures or future injunctive relief ordered by the government could have on the Company's consolidated financial statements either in the current period or in future periods. 
 Environmental Remediation: Reasonably Possible Matters. The Company's assessment of the potential impact of environmental contingencies is subject to considerable uncertainty due to the complex, ongoing and evolving process of investigation and remediation, if necessary, of such environmental contingencies, and the potential for technological and regulatory developments. As such, in addition to the amounts currently reserved for contingencies that are probable and reasonably estimable as discussed above, the Company may be subject to reasonably possible loss contingencies related to environmental matters in the range of to .

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with information contained in the accompanying unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of Westlake Corporation and the notes thereto and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of Westlake Corporation included in Westlake Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the "2023 Form 10-K"). Unless otherwise indicated, references in this report to "we," "our," "us" or like terms refer to Westlake Corporation ("Westlake" or the "Company"). The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please read "Forward-Looking Statements" for a discussion of limitations inherent in such statements. 
 Overview 
 We are a vertically integrated global manufacturer and marketer of performance and essential materials and housing and infrastructure products. We operate in two principal operating segments, Performance and Essential Materials and Housing and Infrastructure Products. The Performance and Essential Materials segment includes Westlake North American Vinyls, Westlake North American Chlor-alkali Derivatives, Westlake European Asian Chlorovinyls, Westlake Olefins, Westlake Polyethylene and Westlake Epoxy. The Housing and Infrastructure Products segment includes Westlake Royal Building Products, Westlake Pipe Fittings, Westlake Global Compounds and Westlake Dimex. We are highly integrated along our materials chain with significant downstream integration from ethylene and chlor-alkali (chlorine and caustic soda) into vinyls, polyethylene, epoxy and styrene monomer. We also have substantial downstream integration from polyvinyl chloride ("PVC") into our building products, PVC pipes and fittings and PVC compounds in our Housing and Infrastructure Products segment. 
 Since 2022 our European businesses were impacted by higher energy prices, inflation and reduced demand. Our North American businesses, where we derive a significant portion of our revenue, also experienced the impacts of high energy costs and interest rates and slower demand for most of our products since the second half of 2022. However, since the second half of 2023 we have experienced lower energy costs in Europe and North America as prices for electricity and natural gas have declined following the elevated 2022 levels and inflation has eased since the 2022 levels, although it still remains a concern. In the near term, we expect that the volatility in energy prices, higher interest rates, inflation and other macroeconomic conditions will continue to impact margins and demand for most of our products. 
 Recent Developments 
 Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Investigations 
 On April 3, 2024, the U.S. Epoxy Resin Producers Ad Hoc Coalition (the "Coalition"), of which we are a member, filed petitions with the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission requesting the initiation of antidumping investigations regarding imports of certain epoxy resins from China, India, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand and countervailing duty investigations regarding imports of the same products from China, India, South Korea, and Taiwan. On September 13, 2024, the U.S. Department of Commerce published its preliminary countervailing duty determination and imposed provisional duties ranging from 0 to 113.83 percent. The preliminary antidumping determination is expected to be issued in early November 2024. 
 On June 6, 2024, the Coalition confidentially lodged an antidumping complaint with the European Commission requesting the initiation of an antidumping investigation concerning imports of epoxy resins into the European Union market originating in China, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. On July 1, 2024, the European Commission published in the EU Official Journal a notice initiating an antidumping investigation concerning imports of epoxy resins originating in China, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand.

AC and ECH Pernis Units 
 On July 2, 2024, the Company approved a plan to temporarily cease operations ("mothball") of the allyl chloride (AC) and epichlorohydrin (ECH) units at the Company's site in Pernis, the Netherlands (collectively, the "Units"). The Company continues to operate the liquid epoxy resin (LER) and bisphenol A (BPA) units at the Pernis facility. 
 On July 29, 2024, the Company notified the affected employees at the Units that management approved the plan to mothball the Units. The Units are expected to temporarily cease operations in 2025. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company accrued expenses of approximately 75 million related to mothballing of the Units that consisted of charges for environmental remediation and other plant mothballing expenses of approximately 71 million and of employee severance and separation expenses of approximately 4 million. 
 Once the mothballing is completed, the Company expects these actions will materially improve the financial performance of the Pernis, Netherlands site while enabling the Company to continue to serve its customers with BPA, LER, solutions, and epoxy specialty resins. 
 Performance and Essential Materials 
 Our performance and essential materials such as ethylene, PVC, polyethylene, epoxy and caustic soda are some of the most widely used materials in the world and are upgraded into a wide variety of higher value-added products used in many end-markets. Westlake is the second-largest chlor-alkali producer and the second-largest PVC producer in the world, which makes Westlake a leading global chlorovinyls producer. Our performance and essential materials are used by customers in PVC pipe applications; housing and construction products; food and specialty packaging; industrial and consumer packaging; renewable wind energy; coatings; consumer durables; medical health applications; and mobility and transportation. Chlor-alkali and petrochemicals are typically manufactured globally in large volume by a number of different producers using widely available technologies. The chlor-alkali and petrochemical industries exhibit cyclical commodity characteristics, and margins are influenced by changes in the balance between global supply and demand and the resulting operating rates, the level of general economic activity and the price of raw materials. Due to the significant size of new plants, capacity additions are built in large increments and typically require several years of demand growth to be absorbed. The cycle is generally characterized by periods of tight supply, leading to high operating rates and margins, followed by a decline in operating rates and margins primarily as a result of excess new capacity additions. Westlake is a leading supplier of liquid and solid epoxy resins that are used in a wide variety of industrial coating applications. We are also one of the leading producers of epoxy specialty resins, modifiers and curing agents in Europe, the United States and Asia with a global reach to our end markets. Epoxy resins are the fundamental component of many types of materials and are often used in the automotive, construction, wind energy, aerospace and electronics industries due to their superior adhesion, strength and durability. 
 Global demand for most of our products started to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the second half of 2020 and remained strong through the first half of 2022. However, since the second half of 2022 and during the early part of 2023, we saw significant volatility in natural gas and electricity costs, particularly in Europe, as well as in ethane and ethylene prices. We have experienced a decline in natural gas and electricity costs since the second half of 2023 through the third quarter of 2024. Since the first half of 2022, we have continued to experience lower prices and weak demand for most of our products globally. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the conflict in the Middle East, slow economic growth in China, increase in bisphenol-A, epichlorohydrin and base epoxy resin exports out of Asia into European and North American markets, timing of certain new ethylene and polyethylene capacity additions in North America, Asia, and the Middle East, volatility in natural gas and electricity prices, volatility in crude oil prices and inflationary pressures could have a continuing negative impact on the performance of Performance and Essential Materials businesses. 
 As noted in Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in our 2023 Form 10-K, we are subject to extensive environmental regulations, which may impose significant additional costs on our operations in the future. Further, concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and their possible effects on climate change has led to the enactment of regulations, and to proposed legislation and additional regulations, that could affect us in the form of increased cost of feedstocks and fuel, other increased costs of production and decreased demand for our products. While we do not expect any of these enactments or proposals to have a material adverse effect on us in the near term, we cannot predict the longer-term effect of any of these regulations on our future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Housing and Infrastructure Products 
 Our Housing and Infrastructure Products segment is primarily comprised of residential building products, PVC pipes and fittings and PVC compound products. Our sales are affected by new home constructions and home repair and remodeling as well as the decisions of distributors and dealers on the levels of inventory they carry, their views on product demand, their financial condition and the manner in which they choose to manage inventory risk. A significant portion of our performance in this segment is driven by the activities in the residential construction and repair and remodeling markets in North America, which began to decline at the end of the second quarter of 2022 primarily due to the negative effect that rising mortgage rates in the United States had on buyer sentiment. Since the beginning of 2024, with the stabilization of interest rates and the possibility of further interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve in the near term, we have seen improvement in the demand for housing products. Performance of our housing and infrastructure products businesses over time are generally reflective of the trends of building permits and housing starts in the New Residential Construction Survey by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Repair and Remodeling Index (RRI) provided by the National Association of Home Builders (the "NAHB") among others. Although we ultimately expect that the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 and historically low residential housing construction that has resulted in an undersupply of existing housing may have a favorable long-term impact on our Housing and Infrastructure Products segment, the current inflationary environment impacting consumer spending and priorities and decade-high mortgage interest rates impacting consumer affordability are expected to have an unfavorable impact on the demand for housing construction in the near term and, as a result, our products produced by this segment. 
 Factors that have caused volatility in our raw material prices, energy costs and production processes in the past, and which may do so in the future, include significant fluctuation in prices of these raw materials in response to, among other things, variable worldwide supply and demand across different industries, speculation in commodities futures, general economic, business or environmental conditions, labor costs, competition, import duties, tariffs, worldwide currency fluctuations, freight, inflationary pressures, regulatory costs, and product and process evolutions that impact demand for the same materials. Increasing raw material prices directly impact our cost of sales and our ability to maintain margins depends on implementing price increases in response to increasing raw material costs. The market for our products may or may not accept price increases, and as such, our future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially impacted.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 The body of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States is commonly referred to as "GAAP." For this purpose, a non-GAAP financial measure is generally defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") as one that purports to measure historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that (1) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows (or equivalent statements) of the registrant; or (2) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. In this report, we disclose non-GAAP financial measures, primarily earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") and Free Cash Flow. We define EBITDA as net income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment. The non-GAAP financial measures described in this Form 10-Q are not substitutes for the GAAP measures of earnings and cash flows. 
 EBITDA is included in this Form 10-Q because our management considers it an important supplemental measure of our performance and believes that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry, some of which present EBITDA when reporting their results. We regularly evaluate our performance as compared to other companies in our industry that have different financing and capital structures and/or tax rates by using EBITDA. In addition, we utilize EBITDA in evaluating acquisition targets. Management also believes that EBITDA is a useful tool for measuring our ability to meet our future debt service and satisfy capital expenditure and working capital requirements, and EBITDA is commonly used by us and our investors to measure our ability to service indebtedness. 
 Free Cash Flow is included in this Form 10-Q because our management considers it an important supplemental measure of our performance and believes that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry, some of which present Free Cash Flow when reporting their results. We regularly evaluate our performance as compared to other companies in our industry that have different financing and capital structures and/or tax rates by using Free Cash Flow. Management also believes that Free Cash Flow is useful to investors and securities analysts to evaluate our liquidity, evaluate strategic investment, evaluate our stock buyback plan and measure our ability to meet our future debt service. 
 EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are not substitutes for the GAAP measures of net income, income from operations and net cash provided by operating activities and are not necessarily measures of our ability to fund our cash needs. In addition, companies calculate EBITDA and Free Cash Flow differently and, therefore, EBITDA and Free Cash Flow as presented for us may not be comparable to EBITDA and Free Cash Flow reported by other companies. EBITDA has material limitations as a performance measure because it excludes interest expense, depreciation and amortization and income taxes. Free Cash Flow has material limitations as a performance measure because it only considers net cash provided by operating activities, and not net income or income from operations. For instance, it applies the entire cost of capital expenditure in the period in which the property or equipment is acquired, rather than spreading it over several periods as is the case with net income and income from operations. 
 Reconciliations of EBITDA to net income, income from operations and net cash provided by operating activities, and Free Cash Flow to net cash provided by operating activities are included in the "Results of Operations" section below.

Summary 
 For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, net income attributable to Westlake was 108 million, or 0.83 per diluted share, on net sales of 3,117 million. This represents a decrease in net income attributable to Westlake of 177 million, or 1.37 per diluted share, compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 net income attributable to Westlake of 285 million, or 2.20 per diluted share, on net sales of 3,115 million. Income from operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 180 million, a 169 million decrease in income from operations of 349 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net income and income from operations was primarily due to lower sales prices for our products across both segments and the accrual of 75 million expense associated with mothballing of the Units in Pernis, Netherlands. The higher ethylene purchase costs, which included the impact of greater quantities of purchased ethylene in the third quarter of 2024 due to lower production caused by maintenance activities at our ethylene producing joint venture LACC, also had a negative impact on our margins during the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023. This decrease was partially offset by higher sales volumes for caustic soda and chlorine and lower feedstock and natural gas costs. Net income was also positively impacted by higher interest income. Net sales of 3,117 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was comparable to 3,115 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase in sales volumes for caustic soda, chlorine and epoxy resin was offset by the lower sales prices for most of our products across both segments and lower pipe and fittings sales volumes. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income attributable to Westlake was 595 million, or 4.58 per diluted share, on net sales of 9,299 million. This represents a decrease in net income attributable to Westlake of 381 million, or 2.98 per diluted share, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 net income attributable to Westlake of 976 million, or 7.56 per diluted share, on net sales of 9,722 million. Income from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 809 million, a 472 million decrease from income from operations of 1,281 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decreases in net income and income from operations were primarily due to lower sales prices for our products across both segments. The decreases in net income and income from operations in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were partially offset by higher PVC resin, caustic soda, chlorine, polyethylene, pipe and fittings and siding and trim sales volumes and lower natural gas and feedstock costs. Net income was favorably impacted by higher interest income. Net sales decreased by 423 million to 9,299 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 9,722 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower sales prices for our products, partially offset by higher sales volumes for PVC resin, caustic soda, chlorine, epoxy resin, polyethylene, pipe and fittings and siding and trim. 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Third Quarter 2024 Compared with Third Quarter 2023 
 Net Sales . Net sales of 3,117 million in the third quarter of 2024 was comparable to 3,115 million in the third quarter of 2023. Average sales prices for the third quarter of 2024 decreased by 3 as compared to the third quarter of 2023 as a result of lower sales prices for our products across both segments. Sales volumes increased by 3 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023, due to higher sales volumes for caustic soda, chlorine and epoxy resin, partially offset by lower pipe and fittings sales volumes. 
 Gross Profit . Gross profit margin was 16 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 19 in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to lower sales prices for several of our products, which was partially offset by higher sales volumes for some of our products and lower energy and feedstock costs. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses . Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 9 million to 215 million in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 206 million in the third quarter of 2023.

Other Income, Net . Other income, net decreased by 12 million to 44 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 56 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was substantially due to lower insurance recoveries recognized partially offset by higher interest income attributable to a higher average cash and cash equivalents balance and higher interest rates in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 Income Taxes. The effective income tax rate was 35.1 for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 19.2 for the third quarter of 2023. The effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2024 was higher compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to a valuation allowance recorded against Westlake Epoxy Netherlands's net operating loss, which was due to the expenses related to the mothballing of the Units in Pernis, Netherlands and foreign taxes, partially offset by lower state taxes and U.S. federal research and development credits available to the Company. 
 Performance and Essential Materials Segment 
 Net Sales . Net sales for the Performance and Essential Materials segment increased by 48 million, or 2 , to 2,019 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 1,971 million in the third quarter of 2023.

Average sales prices for the Performance and Essential Materials segment decreased by 3 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023. Lower Essential Materials sales prices were primarily due to lower caustic soda and chlorine sales prices, which were partially offset by higher polyethylene sales prices under Performance Materials. 
 Income from Operations . Income from operations for the Performance and Essential Materials segment decreased by 114 million to an operating loss of 9 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 105 million income in the third quarter of 2023. This decrease in income from operations in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the third quarter of 2023, was primarily due to lower sales prices for our major products, particularly caustic soda and the accrual of 75 million expense associated with mothballing of the Units in Pernis, Netherlands. The higher ethylene purchase costs, which included the impact of greater quantities of purchased ethylene in the third quarter of 2024 due to lower production caused by maintenance activities at our ethylene producing joint venture LACC, also had a negative impact on our margins during the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023. These decreases were partially offset by higher sales volume for caustic soda, chlorine and epoxy resin and lower natural gas and feedstock costs. 
 Housing and Infrastructure Products Segment 
 Net Sales . Net sales for the Housing and Infrastructure Products segment decreased by 46 million, or 4 , to 1,098 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 1,144 million in the third quarter of 2023. Average sales prices for the Housing and Infrastructure Products segment decreased by 3 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to lower sales prices for pipe and fittings. Sales volumes for the Housing and Infrastructure Products segment decreased by 1 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to lower demand for pipe and fittings 
 Income from Operations.

 Net Sales . Net sales decreased by 423 million, or 4 , to 9,299 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 9,722 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower sales prices for most of our products across both segments. Average sales prices for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 12 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of continuing lower demand for several of our products across both operating segments. Sales volumes increased by 8 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to increased sales volumes of PVC resin, caustic soda, chlorine, epoxy resin, polyethylene, pipe and fittings and siding and trim.

 CASH FLOW DISCUSSION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023 
 Cash Flows 
 Operating Activities 
 Operating activities provided cash of 880 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to cash provided by operating activities of 1,763 million in the first nine months of 2023. The 883 million decrease in cash flows from operating activities was mainly due to lower prices and demand for most of our products and an unfavorable change in working capital in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Changes in components of working capital, which we define for purposes of this cash flow discussion as accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses and other current assets, less accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities, used cash of 413 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 152 million of cash provided in the first nine months of 2023, an unfavorable change of 565 million. The unfavorable change in the first nine months of 2024 was substantially driven by the higher inventory at the end of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and cash outflows related to the 2023 litigation accrual in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used for investing activities in the first nine months of 2024 of 736 million as compared to net cash used for investing activities of 750 million in the first nine months of 2023.

Capital expenditures were 723 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to 752 million in the first nine months of 2023. Capital expenditures in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 were primarily related to projects to increase production capacity or reduce costs, maintenance and safety projects and environmental projects at our various facilities. The investing activities in the first nine months of 2024 as well as in the first nine months of 2023 also included contributions to our unconsolidated subsidiaries which was primarily related to our joint venture LACC, LLC.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Liquidity and Financing Arrangements 
 Our principal sources of liquidity are from cash and cash equivalents, cash from operations, short-term borrowings under the credit agreement and our long-term financing. 
 In November 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a 250 million stock repurchase program (the "2014 Program"). In November 2015, our Board of Directors approved the expansion of the 2014 Program by an additional 150 million. In August 2018, our Board of Directors approved the further expansion of the existing 2014 Program by an additional 150 million. In August 2022, our Board of Directors approved the further expansion of the existing 2014 Program by an additional 500 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had repurchased 8,722,550 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 574 million under the 2014 Program. We did not repurchase any common stock under the 2014 Program during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Purchases under the 2014 Program may be made either through the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Decisions regarding the amount and the timing of purchases under the 2014 Program will be influenced by our cash on hand, our cash flows from operations, general market conditions and other factors. The 2014 Program may be discontinued by our Board of Directors at any time. 
 On October 4, 2018, Westlake Chemical Partners LP ("Westlake Partners") and Westlake Chemical Partners GP LLC, the general partner of Westlake Partners, entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with UBS Securities LLC, Barclays Capital Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner Smith Incorporated and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC to offer and sell Westlake Partners common units, from time to time, up to an aggregate offering amount of 50 million. This Equity Distribution Agreement was amended on February 28, 2020 to reference a new shelf registration and subsequent renewals thereof for utilization under this agreement. No common units have been issued under this program as of September 30, 2024. 
 We believe that our sources of liquidity as described above are adequate to fund our normal operations and ongoing capital expenditures and turnaround activities. Funding of any potential large expansions such as our recent acquisitions or potential future acquisitions or the redemption of debt may likely necessitate, and therefore depend on, our ability to obtain additional financing in the future. We may not be able to access additional liquidity at favorable interest rates due to volatility of the commercial credit markets. 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents totaled 2,915 million. 
 In addition to our cash and cash equivalents, our credit agreement is available to provide liquidity as needed, as described under "Debt" below. 
 Debt 
 As of September 30, 2024, the carrying value of our indebtedness totaled 4,616 million. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for a discussion of our long-term indebtedness. 
 Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. Based on our current level of operations and unless we were to undertake a new expansion or large acquisition, we believe our cash flows from operations, available cash and available borrowings under our credit agreement will be adequate to meet our normal operating needs for the foreseeable future.

 On June 9, 2022, we entered into a new 1.5 billion revolving credit facility that is scheduled to mature on June 9, 2027 (the "Credit Agreement") and, in connection therewith, terminated our then existing revolving credit agreement. The Credit Agreement bears interest at either (a) Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a margin ranging from 1.00 to 1.625 per annum or (b) Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a margin ranging from 0.00 to 0.625 per annum, in each case depending on the credit rating of the Company. The Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including a quarterly total leverage ratio financial maintenance covenant. As of September 30, 2024 , we were in compliance with the total leverage ratio financial maintenance covenant. 
 The Credit Agreement also contains certain events of default and, if and for so long as certain events of default have occurred and are continuing, any overdue amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement will accrue interest at an increased rate, the lenders can terminate their commitments to lend thereunder and payments of any outstanding amounts thereunder could be accelerated by the lenders. None of our subsidiaries are required to guarantee our obligations under the Credit Agreement. 
 The Credit Agreement includes a 150 million sub-limit for letters of credit, and any outstanding letters of credit will be deducted from availability under the facility. The Credit Agreement also provides for a discretionary 50 million commitment for swingline loans to be provided on a same-day basis. We may also increase the size of the facility, in increments of at least 25 million, up to a maximum of 500 million, subject to certain conditions and if certain lenders agree to commit to such an increase.

Westlake Chemical Partners LP Credit Arrangements 
 Our subsidiary, Westlake Chemical Finance Corporation, is the lender party to a 600 million revolving credit facility with Westlake Chemical Partners LP ("Westlake Partners") (the "MLP Revolver") that is scheduled to mature on July 12, 2027. As of September 30, 2024, outstanding borrowings under the credit facility totaled 377 million and bore interest at Secured Overnight Financing Rate, as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ("SOFR") plus the Applicable Margin plus a 0.10 credit spread adjustment. On July 12, 2022, Westlake Partners entered into the Fourth Amendment (the "MLP Revolver Amendment") to the MLP Revolver. The MLP Revolver Amendment, among other things, extended the maturity date to July 12, 2027 and provided for the replacement of LIBOR with SOFR. Borrowings under the MLP Revolver now bear interest at a variable rate of either (a) SOFR plus the Applicable Margin plus a 0.10 credit spread adjustment or, if SOFR is no longer available, (b) the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin minus 1.0 . The Applicable Margin under the MLP Revolver varies between 1.75 and 2.75 , depending on the Partnership's Consolidated Leverage Ratio. 
 Our subsidiary, Westlake Polymers LLC, is the administrative agent to a 600 million revolving credit facility with Westlake Chemical OpCo LP ("OpCo") (the "OpCo Revolver") that is scheduled to mature on July 12, 2027. As of September 30, 2024, outstanding borrowings under the credit facility totaled 23 million and bore interest at SOFR plus the Applicable Margin of 1.75 plus a 0.10 credit spread adjustment. On July 12, 2022, OpCo entered into the Second Amendment (the "OpCo Revolver Amendment") to the OpCo Revolver. The OpCo Revolver Amendment, among other things, extended the maturity date to July 12, 2027 and provided for the replacement of LIBOR with SOFR. Borrowings under the OpCo Revolver now bear interest at a variable rate of either (a) SOFR plus the Applicable Margin plus a 0.10 credit spread adjustment or, if SOFR is no longer available, (b) the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin minus 1.0 . The Applicable Margin under the OpCo Revolver is 1.75 . 
 We consolidate Westlake Partners and OpCo for financial reporting purposes as we have a controlling financial interest. As such, the revolving credit facilities described above between our subsidiaries and Westlake Partners and OpCo are eliminated from the financial statements upon consolidation. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 None.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides safe harbor provisions for forward-looking information. Certain of the statements contained in this report are forward-looking statements. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this report that address activities, events or developments that we expect, project, believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as "believes," "intends," "may," "should," "could," "anticipates," "expected" or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategies or trends. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot give any assurances that these expectations will prove to be correct. Forward-looking statements relate to matters such as: 
 the ultimate timing, outcome and results of integrating the operations of any acquisitions and the ultimate outcome of our operating efficiencies applied to the products and services; the effects of any such acquisition, including the combined company's future financial condition, results of operations, strategy and plans; and expected synergies and other benefits from any such acquisition and our ability to realize such synergies and other benefits; 
 future operating rates, margins, cash flows and demand for our products; 
 industry market outlook, including the price of crude oil, natural gas, ethane, housing starts and repair and remodeling activity; 
 macroeconomic outlook, including elevated interest rates, inflation and possible recession; 
 widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, or any other public health crisis; 
 production capacities; 
 the impact of ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and between Russia and Ukraine; 
 currency devaluation; 
 our ability to borrow under our credit agreement; 
 our ability to meet our liquidity needs; 
 our ability to meet debt obligations under our debt instruments; 
 our intended quarterly dividends; 
 future capacity additions and expansions in the industries in which we compete; 
 timing, funding and results of capital projects; 
 pension plan obligations, funding requirements and investment policies;

Table of Contents 

We have based these statements on assumptions and analyses in light of our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe were appropriate in the circumstances when the statements were made. Forward-looking statements by their nature involve substantial risks and uncertainties that could significantly impact expected results, and actual future results could differ materially from those described in such statements. While it is not possible to identify all factors, we continue to face many risks and uncertainties. Among the factors that could cause actual future results to differ materially are the risks and uncertainties discussed under "Risk Factors" in the 2023 Form 10-K and those described from time to time in our other filings with the SEC including, but not limited to, the following: 
 general economic and business conditions, including inflation, interest rates and possible recession; 
 the cyclical nature of the chemical and building products industries; 
 the availability, cost and volatility of raw materials and energy; 
 uncertainties associated with the United States, European and worldwide economies, including those due to political tensions and conflict in the Middle East, Russia and Ukraine and elsewhere; 
 uncertainties associated with pandemic infectious diseases; 
 uncertainties associated with climate change; 
 the potential impact on demand for ethylene, polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride due to initiatives such as recycling and customers seeking alternatives to polymers; 
 current and potential governmental regulatory actions in the United States and other countries; 
 industry production capacity and operating rates; 
 the supply/demand balance for our products; 
 competitive products and pricing pressures; 
 instability in the credit and financial markets; 
 access to capital markets; 
 terrorist acts; 
 operating interruptions (including leaks, explosions, fires, weather-related incidents, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, labor difficulties, transportation interruptions, spills and releases and other environmental risks); 
 changes in laws or regulations, including trade policies; 
 technological developments; 
 information systems failures and cyberattacks; 
 foreign currency exchange risks; 
 our ability to implement our business strategies; and 
 creditworthiness of our customers. 
 Many of such factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. Any of the factors, or a combination of these factors, could materially affect our future results of operations and the ultimate accuracy of the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of our future performance, and our actual results and future developments may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Management cautions against putting undue reliance on forward-looking statements or projecting any future results based on such statements or present or prior earnings levels. Every forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of the particular statement, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 A substantial portion of our products and raw materials are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply and demand fundamentals change. Accordingly, product margins and the level of our profitability tend to fluctuate with changes in the business cycle. We try to protect against such instability through various business strategies. Our strategies include ethylene product feedstock flexibility and moving downstream into our other products where pricing is more stable. We use derivative instruments (including commodity swaps and options) in certain instances to reduce price volatility risk on feedstocks and products. Based on our open derivative positions at September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 0.10 increase in the price of a gallon of ethane and a hypothetical 0.10 increase in the price of a million British thermal units of natural gas would not have a material impact on our income before income taxes. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to fixed and variable rate debt. At September 30, 2024, we had 4,681 million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate debt. We are subject to the risk of higher interest cost if and when this debt is refinanced. If interest rates were 1.0 higher at the time of refinancing, our annual interest expense would increase by approximately 47 million. Also, at September 30, 2024, we had 20 million principal amount of variable rate debt outstanding, which represents the term loans due 2026 and the tax-exempt waste disposal revenue bonds due 2027. We do not currently hedge our variable interest rate debt, but we may do so in the future. The weighted average variable interest rate for our variable rate debt of 20 million as of September 30, 2024 was 2.36 . A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the average interest rate on our variable rate debt would not result in a material change in the interest expense. 
 SOFR is used as a reference rate for borrowings under our revolving line of credit. We did not have any SOFR-based borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2024. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our international operations. However, the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates caused by our international operations has not had a material impact on our overall operating results. We may engage in activities to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk in certain instances through the use of currency exchange derivative instruments, including forward exchange contracts, cross-currency swaps or spot purchases. A forward exchange contract obligates us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified currencies at a stated exchange rate on a stated date. A cross-currency swap obligates us to make periodic payments in the local currency and receive periodic payments in our functional currency based on the notional amount of the instrument. In January 2018, we entered into foreign exchange hedging contracts designated as net investment hedges with an aggregate notional value of 220 million designed to reduce the volatility in stockholders' equity from changes in currency exchange rates associated with our net investments in foreign operations. In July 2019, we terminated a portion of the foreign exchange hedging contract with a notional value of 70 million. The notional value of the remaining net investment hedges was 150 million at September 30, 2024. The arrangement is scheduled to settle in 2026. 
 In July 2019, we completed the registered public offering of 700 million aggregate principal amount of the 1.625 2029 Senior Notes. We designated this euro-denominated debt as a non-derivative net investment hedge of a portion of our net investments in euro functional-currency denominated subsidiaries to offset foreign currency fluctuations.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective with respect to (i) the accumulation and communication to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we submit under the Exchange Act, and (ii) the recording, processing, summarizing and reporting of such information within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 The 2023 Form 10-K, filed on February 22, 2024, contained a description of various legal proceedings in which we are involved. See Note 13 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for an updated description of certain of those proceedings, which information is incorporated by reference herein. 
 From time to time, we receive notices or inquiries from government entities regarding alleged violations of environmental laws and regulations pertaining to, among other things, the disposal, emission and storage of chemical substances, including hazardous wastes. For a description of certain environmental matters involving a governmental authority as a party to the proceedings and potential monetary sanctions that we believe could exceed 1 million (which is less than one percent of our current assets on a consolidated basis as of September 30, 2024), please see the 2023 Form 10-K and Note 13 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in addition to the following: 
 To resolve alleged violations associated with exceedances of discharge limits under the Natrium facility's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ("NPDES") permit, effective August 2020, we have entered into enforcement negotiations with the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection ("WVDEP"). The resolution of this matter may involve a penalty in excess of 1 million. 
 In September 2019, U.S. EPA Region 6 issued a Notice of Violation alleging certain violations of the Clean Air Act following an inspection of the Lake Charles North facility in 2019 by the National Enforcement Investigation Center. In September 2024, the Company and U.S. EPA Region 6 entered into a Consent Agreement and Final Order requiring certain injunctive relief and the payment of a penalty in the amount of 825,000, resolving this matter. 
 In addition to the matters described above, we are also involved in other legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business. From time to time, we receive notices or inquiries from government entities regarding alleged violations of environmental laws and regulations pertaining to, among other things, the disposal, emission and storage of chemical substances, including hazardous wastes. We do not believe that any of these legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 For a discussion of risk factors, please read Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in the 2023 Form 10-K. The information below includes additional risk relating to legal and regulatory claims, investigations and proceedings. The risks described below and in other documents that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.

Table of Contents 

We are subject to legal and regulatory claims, investigations and proceedings, some of which could be material. 
 We are subject to legal and regulatory claims, investigations and proceedings and could become subject to additional claims, investigations and proceedings in the future, some of which could be material. These proceedings may be brought by the government or private parties and may arise out of a number of matters, including contract disputes, product liability claims, antitrust claims and personal injury claims. Even if we are ultimately successful, defense of these claims can be costly and time-consuming and may divert management's attention and resources. The outcome of any pending or future claims, investigations or proceedings is inherently unpredictable, but such outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Please refer to Note 13, "Commitments and Contingencies," within the unaudited consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information with respect to pending legal and regulatory proceedings.
