 million (as so amended and restated, the Term Loan ), issued at a price equal to , and an accompanying million revolving loan (the Revolving Facility ). The maturity date of the Term Loan is in September 2030. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company borrowed an additional 325.0 million under its Term Loan, comprised of million on March 25, 2024 and million on July 30, 2024. The additional amounts borrowed are fungible with the original 1,500.0 million and have the same maturity date, interest rate and other terms. The additional 125.0 million was issued at a price equal to of its face value, while the additional 200.0 million was issued at of its face value. 
 The proceeds from the March 2024 additional Term Loan were used for the acquisition of Satelles, Inc. (see Note 11 on April 1, 2024. In April 2024, the Company drew down 50.0 million on its Revolving Facility for general corporate purposes, including the funding of repurchases of its common stock. This amount was repaid with the expansion of the Term Loan in July 2024, and there were no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Facility as of September 30, 2024. The remaining proceeds from the July 2024 additional Term Loan have been and are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases. 
 The Term Loan has been repriced on several occasions, most recently in June 2024, and currently bears interest at an annual rate equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus , with a SOFR floor. The Company typically selects a one-month interest period, with the result that interest is calculated using one-month SOFR. Interest is paid monthly on the last business day of the month. Principal payments, payable quarterly, are equal to million per annum (approximately one percent of the full principal amount of the Term Loan following the additional Term Loan amounts borrowed in July 2024), with the remaining principal due upon maturity. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had aggregate borrowings of million and million, respectively, under the Term Loan. These amounts do not give effect to million of net unamortized deferred financing costs at the end of each period. The principal balance in borrowings, net of the unamortized deferred financing costs, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 amounted to million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, based upon recent trading prices (Level 2 - market approach), the fair value of the Company s net borrowings under the Term Loan was million and million, respectively. 
 The Revolving Facility bears interest at an annual rate equal to SOFR plus 2.5 (but without a SOFR floor) if and as drawn, with no original issue discount, and a commitment fee of per annum on the undrawn amount, which was reduced to in the first quarter of 2024 because the Company had a consolidated first lien net leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of less than 3.5 to 1. The Revolving Facility has a maturity date in September 2028. 
 The Credit Agreement restricts the Company s ability to incur liens, engage in mergers or asset sales, pay dividends, repay subordinated indebtedness, incur indebtedness, make investments and loans, and engage in other transactions as specified in the 
 10 

to 1 if more than of the Revolving Facility has been drawn or subject to letter of credit exposure. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate exposure under the Revolving Facility was less than 35 . The Credit Agreement contains other customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default. The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants as of September 30, 2024. 
 Interest on Debt 
 Total interest incurred includes amortization of deferred financing fees and capitalized interest. The Company incurred third-party financing costs of million in connection with the expansion of the Term Loan in July 2024, million related to the repricing of the Term Loan in June 2024 and million in connection with the expansion of the Term Loan in March 2024, substantially all of which were expensed. The amounts expensed are included within interest expense on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). 
 Amortization of deferred financing fees Capitalized interest 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, accrued interest on the Term Loan was million and million, respectively.

 . The Company pays a fixed monthly premium based on an annual rate of for the Cap. The Cap carried a notional amount of billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 The Cap, which was not affected by the expansion of the Term Loan in July 2024 and March 2024 or the repricing of the Term Loan in June 2024, is designed to mirror the terms of the Term Loan and to offset the cash flows being hedged. The Company designated the Cap as a cash flow hedge of the variability of the SOFR-based interest payments on the Term Loan. The effective portion of the Cap s change in fair value is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. Any ineffective portion of the Cap s change in fair value will be recorded in current earnings as interest expense. 
 Hedge effectiveness of the current interest rate cap contract is based on a long-haul hypothetical derivative methodology and includes all changes in value. The Company formally assesses, both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing quarterly basis, whether the designated derivative instruments are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged items. When the hedging instrument is sold, expires, is terminated, is exercised, no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, is de-designated, or is no longer probable, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.

million and million, respectively, for the fair value of the Cap and a liability balance of million and million, respectively, for the fair value of the Cap premium. Both the Cap and the Cap premium are recorded net within other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
 During each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company collectively incurred million and million, respectively, in interest expense for the Cap premium. Interest expense was reduced by million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, for payments received related to the Cap. 
 Gains and losses resulting from fair value adjustments to the Cap are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income within the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets and reclassified to interest expense on the dates that interest payments become due. Cash flows related to the derivative contracts are included in cash flows from operating activities on the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Over the next 12 months, the Company expects any gains or losses for cash flow hedges amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings to have an immaterial impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.) ) Tax benefit (expense)

The remaining million authorized shares of preferred stock remain undesignated and unissued. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no outstanding shares of preferred stock, as all previously designated and issued preferred stock was converted into common stock in prior periods. 
 Dividends 
 Stockholders are entitled to receive, when and if declared by the Company s Board of Directors from time to time, dividends and other distributions in cash, stock or property from the Company s assets or funds legally and contractually available for such purposes. In December 2022, the Company s Board of Directors initiated a quarterly dividend. The Company paid dividends of on March 28, 2024 and per share of common stock on each of June 28, 2024 and September 30, 2024, resulting in total payments to stockholders of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Dividend payments for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled million. The Company s liability related to dividends payable on common shares underlying unvested RSUs was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 Since February 2021, the Company s Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to an aggregate of million of the Company s common stock, including the most recent approval in September 2024 of an additional 500.0 million through December 31, 2027. This timeframe can be extended or shortened by the Board of Directors. Repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market at prevailing prices or in negotiated transactions off the market. The Company records share repurchases at cost, which includes broker commissions and related excise taxes. All shares are immediately retired upon repurchase in accordance with the board-approved policy. When treasury shares are retired, the Company s policy is to allocate the excess of the repurchase price over the par value of shares acquired first, to additional paid-in capital, and then to retained earnings/accumulated deficit. The portion to be allocated to additional paid-in capital is calculated by applying a percentage, determined by dividing the number of shares to be retired by the number of shares outstanding, to the balance of additional paid-in capital as of the date of retirement. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased and subsequently retired million and million shares of its common stock, respectively, for a total purchase price of million and million, respectively, inclusive of related commissions. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company

 The Company s contracts with customers generally do not contain performance obligations with terms in excess of one year. As such, the Company does not disclose details related to the value of performance obligations that are unsatisfied as of the end of the reporting period. The total value of any performance obligations that extend beyond one year is immaterial to the financial statements. 
 The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable, unbilled receivables (contract assets), and deferred revenue (contract liabilities) on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company bills amounts under its agreed-upon contractual terms at periodic intervals (for services), upon shipment (for equipment), or upon achievement of contractual milestones or as work progresses (for engineering and support services). Billing may occur subsequent to revenue recognition, resulting in unbilled accounts receivable (contract assets). The Company may also receive payments from customers before revenue is recognized, resulting in deferred revenue (contract liabilities).

 . The Amended 2015 Plan provides for the grant of stock-based awards, including nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units RSUs ), stock appreciation rights and other equity securities to employees, consultants and non-employee directors of the Company and its affiliated entities. The number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the Amended 2015 Plan is reduced by (i) share for each share of common stock issued pursuant to an appreciation award, such as a stock option or stock appreciation right with an exercise or strike price of at least of the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant, and (ii) shares for each share of common stock issued pursuant to any stock award that is not an appreciation award, also known as a full value award. The Amended 2015 Plan allows the Company to utilize a broad array of equity incentives and performance cash incentives in order to secure and retain the services of its employees, directors and consultants, and to provide long-term incentives that align the interests of its employees, directors and consultants with the interests of the Company s stockholders. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation at fair value. 
 Restricted Stock Units 
 Beginning in March 2024, the RSUs granted to employees for service generally vest over , with vesting on the first anniversary of the grant date and the remainder vesting ratably on a quarterly basis thereafter, subject to continued employment. RSUs granted prior to March 2024 generally vest over , with vesting on the first anniversary of the 
 14 

on the first anniversary of the grant date, with the remaining vesting quarterly thereafter through the second anniversary of the grant date. 
 The Company s RSUs are classified as equity awards because the RSUs will be settled in the Company s common stock upon vesting. The fair value of the RSUs is determined based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant. The related compensation expense as of the grant date is then recognized over the service period, or shorter periods based on the retirement eligibility of grantees, based on the number of shares expected to vest. The fair value of the awards is not remeasured at the end of each reporting period. RSUs do not carry voting rights until they are vested, although certain unvested RSUs are entitled to accrue dividend equivalent rights, and shares (including additional shares issuable upon satisfaction of any accrued dividend equivalent rights) are issued upon settlement in accordance with the terms of the award.

 (1) These RSUs were granted to the Company s Board of Directors as a part of their compensation for board and committee service and had vested but had not yet settled, meaning that the underlying shares of common stock had not been issued and released. 
 Service-Based RSUs 
 The majority of the annual compensation the Company provides to non-employee members of its Board of Directors is paid in the form of RSUs. Some members of the Company s Board of Directors may elect to receive the remainder of their annual compensation, or a portion thereof, in the form of RSUs. An aggregate amount of approximately and service-based RSUs were granted to the non-employee members of the Company s Board of Directors as a result of these payments and elections during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with an estimated grant date fair value of million and million, respectively. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company granted approximately and service-based RSUs, respectively, to its employees, with an estimated aggregate grant date fair value of million and million, respectively. 
 Performance-Based RSUs 
 In March 2024 and 2023, the Company granted approximately and annual incentive, performance-based RSUs, respectively, to the Company s executives and employees (the Bonus RSUs ), with an estimated grant date fair value of million and million, respectively. Vesting of the Bonus RSUs is dependent upon the Company s achievement of 
 15 

and long-term, performance-based RSUs, respectively, to the Company s executives (the Executive RSUs ). The estimated aggregate grant date fair value of the Executive RSU grants was million and 8.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Vesting of the Executive RSUs is dependent upon the Company s achievement of defined performance goals over a two-year period. The vesting of the March 2023 Executive RSUs will ultimately range from to of the number of shares underlying the Executive RSUs granted, and the vesting of the March 2024 Executive RSUs will ultimately range from 0 to 200 of the number of shares underlying the Executive RSUs granted, in each case based on the level of achievement of the performance goals. If the Company achieves the performance goals, of the number of Executive RSUs earned based on performance will vest on the second anniversary of the grant date, and the remaining will vest on the third anniversary of the grant date, in each case subject to the executive s continued service as of the vesting date, which may be accelerated based on the retirement eligibility of grantees. During March 2024 and 2023, the Company awarded approximately and additional shares, respectively, related to long-term, performance-based RSUs granted to the Company s executives in 2022 and 2021, respectively, for over-achievement of performance targets for the performance periods ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 Stock Option Awards

 Overview of Our Business 
 We are engaged primarily in providing mobile voice and data communications services using a constellation of orbiting satellites. We are the only commercial provider of communications services offering true global coverage, connecting people, organizations and assets to and from anywhere, in real time. Our low-earth orbit, L-band satellite network provides reliable, weather-resilient communications services to regions of the world where terrestrial wireless or wireline networks do not exist or are limited, including remote land areas, open ocean, airways, the polar regions and regions where the telecommunications infrastructure has been affected by political conflicts or natural disasters. 
 We provide voice and data communications services to businesses, the U.S. and foreign governments, non-governmental organizations and consumers via our satellite network, which has an architecture of 66 operational satellites with in-orbit spares and related ground infrastructure. We utilize an interlinked mesh architecture to route traffic across the satellite constellation using radio frequency crosslinks between satellites. This unique architecture minimizes the need for ground facilities to support the constellation, which facilitates the global reach of our services and allows us to offer services in countries and regions where we have no physical presence. 
 On April 1, 2024, we acquired Satelles, Inc., or Satelles, a provider of satellite-based time and location services that complement and protect GPS and other GNSS systems. This acquisition is intended to support our long-term business objectives. 
 We sell our products and services to commercial end-users through a wholesale distribution network, encompassing approximately 110 service providers, 305 value-added resellers, or VARs, and 85 value-added manufacturers, or VAMs, who either sell directly to the end user or indirectly through other service providers, VARs or dealers. These distributors often integrate our products and services with other complementary hardware and software and have developed a broad suite of applications using our products and services targeting specific lines of business. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had approximately 2,482,000 billable subscribers worldwide, an increase of 246,000, or 11 , from approximately 2,236,000 billable subscribers as of September 30, 2023. We have a diverse customer base, with end users in land mobile, Internet of Things, or IoT, maritime, aviation and government. 

20 

Material Trends and Uncertainties 
 Our industry and customer base have historically grown as a result of: 
 demand for remote and reliable mobile communications services; 
 a growing number of new products and services and related applications; 
 a broad wholesale distribution network with access to diverse and geographically dispersed niche markets; 
 increased demand for communications services by disaster and relief agencies, and emergency first responders; 
 improved data transmission speeds for mobile satellite service offerings; 
 regulatory mandates requiring the use of mobile satellite services; 
 a general reduction in prices of mobile satellite services and subscriber equipment; and 
 geographic market expansion through the ability to offer our services in additional countries. 
 Nonetheless, we face a number of challenges and uncertainties in operating our business, including: 
 our ability to maintain the health, capacity, control and level of service of our satellites; 
 our ability to develop and launch new and innovative products and services; 
 changes in general economic, business and industry conditions, including the effects of currency exchange rates; 
 our reliance on a single primary commercial gateway and a primary satellite network operations center; 
 competition from other mobile satellite service providers and, to a lesser extent, from the expansion of terrestrial-based cellular phone systems and related pricing pressures; 
 market acceptance of our products; 
 regulatory requirements in existing and new geographic markets; 
 challenges associated with global operations, including as a result of conflicts in or affecting markets in which we operate; 
 rapid and significant technological changes in the telecommunications industry; 
 our ability to generate sufficient internal cash flows to repay our debt; 
 reliance on our wholesale distribution network to market and sell our products, services and applications effectively; 
 reliance on a global supply chain, including single-source suppliers for the manufacture of most of our subscriber equipment and for some of the components required in the manufacture of our end-user subscriber equipment and our ability to purchase component parts that are periodically subject to shortages resulting from surges in demand, natural disasters or other events, including a global pandemic; and 
 reliance on a few significant customers, particularly agencies of the U.S. government, for a substantial portion of our revenue, as a result of which the loss or decline in business with any of these customers may negatively impact our revenue and collectability of related accounts receivable.

 (3) Commercial broadband service consists of Iridium OpenPort and Iridium Certus broadband services. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, total commercial services revenue increased 7.8 million, or 6 , from the prior year period primarily as a result of increases in IoT, voice and data, and hosted payload and other data service revenue. Commercial IoT revenue increased 5.2 million, or 14 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of the prior year, primarily driven by a 14 increase in billable subscribers, largely due to strength in personal communication devices. Commercial voice and data revenue increased 1.5 million, or 3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of the prior year, due primarily to an increase in billable subscribers. Hosted payload and other data service revenue also contributed with an increase of 1.4 million, or 9 , primarily due to increases in other data service revenue, including Satelles revenue, that was not present in the prior year, offset in part by decreased hosted payload revenue recognition resulting from the change in the estimated useful lives of our satellites in the fourth quarter of 2023.

 We provide airtime and airtime support to the U.S. government and other authorized customers pursuant to our Enhanced Mobile Satellite Services, or EMSS, contract. Under the terms of this agreement, which we entered into in September 2019, authorized customers utilize specified Iridium airtime services provided through the U.S. government s dedicated gateway. The fee is not based on subscribers or usage, allowing an unlimited number of users access to these services. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenue was 26.5 million, consistent with the prior year. On September 15, 2024, the annual rate increased reflecting a contractual step up in the EMSS contract. 
 
 23 

Subscriber Equipment Revenue 
 Subscriber equipment revenue increased by 1.7 million, or 9 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to an increase in the volume of handset sales, offset in part by a decrease in Short Burst Data sales. As previously disclosed, we expect 2024 equipment sales to be lower than in 2023 and more in line with periods prior to 2022.

 Engineering and support service revenue increased by 5.5 million, or 22 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increased work under certain government contracts, predominantly the contract awarded by the Space Development Agency, or the SDA. Based on the SDA contract, we expect engineering and support service revenue, as well as associated expenses, to be generally higher than in years prior to 2023 throughout the life of the SDA contract. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Cost of Services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 
 Cost of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) includes the cost of network engineering and operations staff, including contractors, software maintenance, product support services and cost of services for government and commercial engineering and support service revenue. 
 Cost of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) increased by 2.5 million, or 6 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period, primarily as a result of the increase in work under certain government projects, including the SDA contract, as noted above. 
 Cost of Subscriber Equipment 
 Cost of subscriber equipment includes the direct costs of equipment sold, which consist of manufacturing costs, allocation of overhead, and warranty costs. 
 Cost of subscriber equipment remained relatively flat for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily due to an increase in the volume of handset sales, offset in part by the decrease in Short Burst Data sales, which was in line with the change in equipment revenue for the same period, as described above. Subscriber equipment costs remained consistent, which did not align to the increase in subscriber equipment revenue primarily due to product mix and a decrease in inventory component costs. 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses increased by 1.2 million, or 23 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period, due to increased spending on device-related features for our network, including Project Stardust, which is our multi-year project to develop Iridium NTN Direct SM , our standards-based Narrowband-Internet of Things (NB-IoT) and Non-Terrestrial Network (NB-NTN) messaging and SOS capabilities for smartphones, tablets, cars and related consumer applications. 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses that are not directly attributable to the sale of services or products include sales and marketing costs, as well as employee-related expenses (such as salaries, wages, and benefits), legal, finance, information technology, facilities, billing and customer care expenses. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 10.6 million, or 32 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period, due primarily to costs related to the acquisition of Satelles, increased professional fees including stock appreciation rights expense in the current year resulting from changes in our stock valuation between the years, higher headcount costs, including equity compensation costs, and certain costs that were previously recorded in cost of services. 
 24 

Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by 25.7 million, or 33 , for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we updated our estimate of the satellites remaining useful lives based on the health of the constellation, resulting in an extension of the useful lives from 12.5 years to 17.5 years and a reduction of quarterly depreciation expense as compared to periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2023. As a result of this change in estimate, we expect depreciation expense to be approximately 83.3 million lower for the full year 2024 as compared to the full year 2023. 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 Interest expense, net decreased 10.4 million, or 30 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. We incurred 14.7 million of fees in connection with our Term Loan refinancing in September 2023, compared to 2.2 million of fees that were incurred in connection with our increased Term Loan in the third quarter of 2024. These decreases were offset in part primarily by the increases in the average outstanding debt balance following the additional 200.0 million in Term Loan in July 2024 and 125.0 million in March 2024. 
 Income Tax Benefit (Expense) 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our income tax expense was 6.0 million, compared to income tax benefit of 6.0 million for the prior year period. The increase in income tax expense was primarily related to the increase in pre-tax book income in 2024 as compared to 2023. 
 Loss on Equity Method Investments 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our realized net loss on equity method investments was 0.5 million, compared to a loss of 1.5 million in the prior year period. These reflect the portion of losses recorded on our equity method investments. 
 Net Income (Loss) 
 Net income was 24.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of 1.6 million for the prior year period. The 26.1 million increase in net income was primarily the result of the 25.7 million decrease in depreciation expense, the 15.2 million increase in total revenue and the 10.4 million decrease in interest expense, net, offset in part by the 10.6 million increase in selling, general and administrative expense and the 12.0 million increase in income tax expense.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total commercial services revenue increased 24.5 million, or 7 , from the prior year period primarily driven by increases in IoT and voice and data service revenue. Commercial IoT revenue increased 19.8 million, or 19 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year period, driven by a 14 increase in IoT billable subscribers, largely due to strength in personal communication devices and a new contract with a large customer executed in the first quarter of 2024. Commercial voice and data revenue increased 5.5 million, or 3 , from the prior year period primarily due to an increase in billable subscribers. These increases were offset in part by a decrease of 0.5 million, or 1 , in broadband revenue compared to the prior year period and a decrease of 0.3 million, or 1 , in hosted payload and other data service revenue compared to the prior year period. The decrease in hosted payload and other data service revenue was primarily due to decreased hosted payload revenue recognition resulting from the change in the estimated useful lives of our satellites in the fourth quarter of 2023, offset in part by increases in other data service revenue including Satelles revenue.

 Cost of Services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 
 Cost of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) increased by 16.3 million, or 14 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year period primarily as a result of an increase in work under certain government engineering contracts, including the SDA contract, as noted above, and higher satellite operation costs. 
 Cost of Subscriber Equipment 
 Cost of subscriber equipment decreased by 15.5 million, or 28 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the decrease in volume of handset sales, offset in part by an increase in Short Burst Data sales, which was in line with the change and expectations in equipment revenue for the same period, as noted above, and decreased inventory component costs. 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses increased by 5.4 million, or 37 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year period, due to increased spending on device-related features for our network, including Project Stardust, as noted above. 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 18.1 million, or 17 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to higher headcount-related expenses, including equity compensation costs, as well as costs related to the acquisition of Satelles and certain costs that were previously recorded in cost of services, offset in part by a decrease in stock appreciation rights expense in the current year resulting from changes in our stock valuation between the years and decreased spending related to our channel partner conference which was held in the first quarter of the prior year. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by 115.5 million, or 43 , compared to the prior year period primarily due to the change in the estimate of the useful lives of our satellites in the fourth quarter of 2023. Additionally, we wrote off our remaining ground spare satellite in the second quarter of 2023 following completion of on-orbit testing, which resulted in accelerated depreciation expense of 37.5 million. No write-offs occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Other Expense 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 Interest expense, net decreased 2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period, primarily related to the decrease in fees paid in connection with changes to the Term Loan. In September 2023, we paid 14.7 million of fees incurred in connection with our Term Loan refinancing. In 2024, we incurred 5.7 million of fees in connection 
 28 

with the additional debt and repricing, that are included in interest expense, net. These decreases in interest expense were offset in part by interest incurred on the increase in the average outstanding debt balance. 
 Other Income (Expense), net 
 Other expense, net, was 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to other income, net, of 1.0 million for the prior year period. The variation was primarily the result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Income Tax Benefit (Expense) 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our income tax expense was 18.5 million, compared to income tax benefit of 16.7 million for the prior year period. The increase in income tax expense was primarily related to the impact of stock compensation tax expense and nondeductible executive compensation plus the increase in pre-tax book income in 2024 as compared to 2023. 
 Gain (Loss) on Equity Method Investments 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our gain on equity method investments was 15.7 million, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Satelles, as we recorded a 19.8 million gain on our previous equity method investment in Satelles, offset in part by the portion of losses recorded on other equity method investments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our loss on equity method investments was 4.3 million, reflecting the portion of losses recorded on equity method investments, including Satelles, during the period. 
 Net Income (Loss) 
 Net income was 76.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of 22.6 million for the prior year period. The 99.0 million improvement primarily resulted from the 115.5 million decrease in depreciation expense, the 21.7 million increase in total revenue and the 20.0 million increase in gain on equity method investments, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Satelles as described above. These improvements were offset in part by the 35.2 million increase in income tax expense and the 24.3 million increase in other operating expenses. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operations, cash and cash equivalents and our Revolving Facility. These sources are expected to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity needs for (i) required principal and interest on the Term Loan and Revolving Facility, (ii) capital expenditures, (iii) working capital, (iv) share repurchases under the program authorized by our Board of Directors, and (v) anticipated cash dividend payments to holders of our common stock. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our total cash and cash equivalents balance was 159.6 million, up from 71.9 million as of December 31, 2023. While we borrowed an additional 325.0 million under the Term Loan during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and generated cash flows from operations, we used cash to complete the acquisition of Satelles, repurchased 284.6 million in our common stock (including related taxes), paid dividends of 49.1 million, and invested 45.6 million in capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Term Loan and Revolving Facility 
 Pursuant to a credit agreement, as amended to date, or the Credit Agreement, we previously entered into a term loan totaling 1,500.0 million, or the Term Loan, issued at a price equal to 99.75 , and an accompanying 100.0 million revolving loan, or the Revolving Facility. The maturity date of the Term Loan is in September 2030. We borrowed an additional 125.0 million under the Term Loan on March 25, 2024 and 200.0 million on July 30, 2024. The additional amounts borrowed are fungible with the original 1,500.0 million, and have the same maturity date, interest rate and other terms. The additional 125.0 million was issued at a price equal to 99.875 of its face value, while the additional 200.0 million was issued at a price equal to 99.0 of its face value. 
 The March 2024 additional Term Loan borrowings were used to complete the acquisition of Satelles, Inc. on April 1, 2024. In April 2024, we drew 50.0 million under our Revolving Facility for general corporate purposes, including the funding of repurchases of our common stock. This amount was repaid with the expansion of the Term Loan in July 2024, and no amounts were outstanding under the Revolving Facility as of September 30, 2024. The remaining proceeds of the Term Loan expansion in 2024 have been and are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases. 
 The Term Loan has been repriced on several occasions, most recently in June 2024, and currently bears interest at an annual rate equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, plus 2.25 , with a 0.75 SOFR floor. We typically select a one-month interest period, with the result that interest is calculated using one-month SOFR. Interest is paid monthly on the last business day of the month. Principal payments, payable quarterly, are equal to 18.3 million per annum (approximately one percent of the full principal amount of the Term Loan following the July 2024 increase), with the remaining principal due upon maturity. 
 29 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had aggregate borrowings of 1,812.3 million and 1,500.0 million, respectively, under the Term Loan. These amounts do not give effect to 17.5 million of net unamortized deferred financing costs at the end of each period. The principal balance in borrowings, net of the unamortized deferred financing costs, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 amounted to 1,794.8 million and 1,482.5 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, based upon recent trading prices (Level 2 - market approach), the fair value of our net borrowings under the Term Loan was 1,782.9 million and 1,506.6 million, respectively. 
 The Revolving Facility bears interest at an annual rate equal to SOFR plus 2.5 (but without a SOFR floor) if and as drawn, with no original issue discount, and a commitment fee of 0.5 per annum on the undrawn amount, which was reduced to 0.375 in the first quarter of 2024 because we had a consolidated first lien net leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of less than 3.5 to 1. The Revolving Facility has a maturity date in September 2028. 
 The Credit Agreement restricts our ability to incur liens, engage in mergers or asset sales, pay dividends, repay subordinated indebtedness, incur indebtedness, make investments and loans, and engage in other transactions as specified in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for specified exceptions, including baskets measured as a percentage of trailing twelve months of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, and unlimited exceptions in the case of incurring indebtedness and liens and making investments, dividend payments, and payments of subordinated indebtedness, based on achievement and maintenance of specified leverage ratios. The Credit Agreement also contains an annual mandatory prepayment sweep mechanism with respect to a portion of our excess cash flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement) in the event our consolidated first lien net leverage ratio rises above 3.5 to 1 as of the end of our fiscal year. As of December 31, 2023, we were below the specified leverage ratio, and a mandatory prepayment sweep was therefore not required. The Credit Agreement permits repayment, prepayment, and repricing transactions. 
 The Credit Agreement contains no financial maintenance covenants with respect to the Term Loan. With respect to the Revolving Facility, the Credit Agreement requires us to maintain a consolidated first lien net leverage ratio of no greater than 6.25 to 1 if more than 35 of the Revolving Facility has been drawn or subject to letter of credit exposure. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate exposure under the Revolving Facility was less than 35 . The Credit Agreement contains other customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default. We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of September 30, 2024. 
 We entered into an interest rate cap contract, or the Cap, which had an effective date of December 2021. The Cap manages our exposure to interest rate movements on a portion of the Term Loan through November 2026. The Cap, as modified to date, currently provides us with the right to receive payment from the counterparty if one-month SOFR exceeds 1.436 , and carried a notional amount of 1.0 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had non-cancelable purchase obligations of approximately 10.9 million for inventory purchases with Benchmark, our primary third-party equipment supplier, which was a decrease of 10.6 million from the end of 2023 primarily due to recovery from supply chain constraints in prior years. These purchase obligations to Benchmark are due within the next twelve months. 
 Our only material long-term contractual cash requirement is the repayment of the remaining principal amount under the Term Loan upon its maturity in 2030, which is expected to be 1,711.9 million. We plan to refinance this amount at or prior to maturity. 
 Dividends 
 Total dividends paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 49.1 million. While we expect to continue regular cash dividends, which began in 2023, any future dividends declared will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition and cash requirements, as well as such other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant.

Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change (In thousands) Cash provided by operating activities 271,166 227,106 44,060 Cash used in investing activities (156,335) (67,285) (89,050) Cash used in financing activities (26,155) (258,371) 232,216 
 Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 44.1 million from the prior year period, primarily due to an increase in working capital of approximately 40.6 million. This increase was mainly the result of changes in inventory, offset by corresponding decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses. In 2023, we replenished finished goods and component inventory, including last time buys. 
 Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 89.1 million as compared to the prior year period, primarily as a result of our acquisition of Satelles on April 1, 2024, offset in part by a decrease in capital expenditures compared to the prior year. We expect our capital expenditures to average approximately 60.0 million per year through 2030. 
 Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 232.2 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to the additional 325.0 million in borrowings under the Term Loan, offset in part by increased repurchases of our common stock. 
 
 Seasonality 
 Our results of operations have been subject to seasonal usage changes for commercial customers, and we expect that our results will be affected by similar seasonality going forward. March through October are typically the peak months for commercial voice services revenue and related subscriber equipment sales. U.S. government revenue and commercial IoT revenue have been less subject to seasonal usage changes. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, useful lives of property and equipment, long-lived assets and other intangible assets, deferred financing costs, income taxes, stock-based compensation, and other estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 15, 2024. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 We had an outstanding aggregate balance of 1,812.3 million under the Term Loan as of September 30, 2024. Under our Term Loan, we pay interest at an annual rate equal to SOFR plus 2.25 , with a 0.75 SOFR floor. Accordingly, we are subject to interest rate fluctuations. The Cap manages our exposure to interest rate movements on a portion of our Term Loan. For every SOFR increase of 25 basis points above the level of the Cap, we expect our annual interest expense to increase by an additional 2.0 million related to the unhedged portion of the Term Loan. 
 Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, as well as accounts receivable. We maintain our cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions with high credit ratings and maintain deposits in excess of federally insured limits. The majority of our cash is invested into a money market fund invested in U.S. treasuries, agency mortgage-backed securities and/or U.S. government-guaranteed debt. Accounts receivable are due from both domestic and international customers. We perform credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and record reserves to provide for estimated credit losses. Accounts payable are owed to both domestic and international vendors.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer, who is our principal executive officer, and our chief financial officer, who is our principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. In evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. In addition, the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 
 There are no material pending legal proceedings, other than routine litigation incidental to our business. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 
 Our business is subject to risks and events that, if they occur, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our securities. In addition to the other information set forth in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 15, 2024, as supplemented by the following risk factor. 
 Our PNT business, acquired in our purchase of Satelles, Inc., may be difficult to integrate and may not achieve its projected results. 
 In April 2024, we completed the acquisition of Satelles, Inc., adding a new line of business, which we refer to as our positioning, navigation and timing, or PNT, business. Satelles is the first company we have acquired in full, and integrating its personnel, services and operations into our existing business may be more difficult than we anticipated, resulting in increased expenses and diversion of management s time. In addition, we may not be successful in growing the PNT business as we have projected, which could harm our financial condition and results of operations.
