Statements that include the words expect, intend, plan, believe, project, forecast, estimate, may, should, anticipate and similar statements of a future or forward-looking nature identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements address matters that involve risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these statements. We believe that these factors include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 the cyclical nature of the workers compensation insurance industry; 

increased competition on the basis of types of insurance offered, premium rates, coverage availability, payment terms, claims management, safety services, policy terms, overall financial strength, financial ratings and reputation; 

changes in relationships with independent agencies (including retail and wholesale brokers and agents); 

general economic conditions, including recession, inflation, performance of financial markets, interest rates, unemployment rates, fluctuating asset values and global health pandemics; 

developments in capital markets that adversely affect the performance of our investments; 

technology breaches or failures, including those resulting from a malicious cyber attack on the Company or its policyholders and service providers; 

decreased level of business activity of our policyholders caused by decreased business activity generally, and in particular in the industries we target; 

greater frequency or severity of claims and loss activity than our underwriting, reserving or investment practices anticipate based on historical experience or industry data; 

adverse developments in economic, competitive, judicial or regulatory conditions within the workers compensation insurance industry; 

loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key employees; 

changes in regulations, laws, rates, rating factors, or taxes applicable to the Company, its policyholders or the agencies that sell its insurance; 

changes in current accounting standards or new accounting standards; 

changes in legal theories of liability under our insurance policies; 

changes in rating agency policies, practices or ratings; 

changes in the availability, cost or quality of reinsurance and the failure of our reinsurers to pay claims in a timely manner or at all; 

the effects of U.S. involvement in hostilities with other countries and large-scale acts of terrorism, or the threat of hostilities or terrorist acts; and 

other risks and uncertainties described from time to time in the Company s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 

The foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read together with the other cautionary statements in this report, and under the caption Risk Factors in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. If one or more events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from what we anticipate.

of comparable consolidated amounts of the Company for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. In the opinion of management of the Company, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly the financial position, the results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and therefore do not include all information and footnotes to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).

The unaudited consolidated financial statements contained herein should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. Some of the estimates result from judgments that can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results in future periods might differ from these estimates.

The Company has established an allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities totaling million. The majority of those securities were issued by states and political subdivisions securities) and corporate bonds securities). The Company has allowance for credit losses on investments classified as available-for-sale for the period ended September 30, 2024. The credit rating used for held-to-maturity fixed income securities is the rating for each security as published by Moody s, S P, and Fitch to determine the probability of default. If there are two ratings, the lower rating is used. If there are three ratings, the median rating is used. If there is one rating, that rating is used. For corporate fixed income securities (given a rating), the probability of default comes from Moody s annual study of corporate bond defaults published each February. The maximum maturity using the default rate is years (any maturity greater than years will use the 20-year rate). For municipal fixed income securities (given a rating), the probability of default comes from Moody s study of municipal bond defaul ts published annually. The calculation of the credit loss allowance takes the amortized cost of the fixed income security and assumes default and recovery based on the average recovery rates from the Moody s default studies. The amortized cost of the security, minus the amount recovered, is the estimated full amount the Company could lose in a default scenario. Then this amount is multiplied by the probability of default to determine the allowance for credit loss. The lower the security is rated, the higher likelihood of default, and therefore a higher allowance for credit loss. The longer to the maturity date of a security, the higher the default risk.

Net realized gains in the quarter ended September 30, 2023 were million resulting from the sale of equity and fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale. Net realized losses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were million resulting primarily from the sale of equity and fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale. Net realized gains in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were million resulting primarily from the sale of equity and fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale. During the third quarter of 2024, we recognized through income million of net unrealized gains on equity securities. During the third quarter of 2023, we recognized through income million of net unrealized losses on equity securities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized through income million of net unrealized gains on equity securities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized through income million of net unrealized losses on equity securities. Investment income is recognized as it is earned. The discount or premium on fixed maturity securities is amortized using the constant yield method. Anticipated prepayments, where applicable, are considered when determining the amortization of premiums or discounts. Realized investment gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method. 

valuation allowance against its deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Income tax expense from operations is different from the amount computed by applying the U.S. federal income tax statutory rate of to income before income taxes primarily due to the impact of tax-exempt investment income and state income tax accruals. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. There were uncertain tax positions for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Tax years 2021 through 2024 are subject to examination by the federal and state taxing authorities.

The foregoing reconciliation reflects favorable development of the net reserves at September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. The favorable development reduced loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred by million and million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The revisions to the Company s reserves reflect new information gained by claims adjusters in the normal course of adjusting claims and is reflected in the financial statements when the information becomes available. It is typical for more serious claims to take several years or longer to settle and the Company continually revises estimates as more information about claimants medical conditions and potential disability becomes known and the claims get closer to being settled. Multiple factors can cause loss development both unfavorable and favorable. The favorable loss development we experienced across accident years was largely due to two factors: (1) lower than expected severity of injuries in these accident years compared to our original and revised estimates; and (2) favorable case reserve development from closed claims and claims where the worker had reached maximum medical improvement. We believe the favorable case reserve development resulted primarily from an intensive claims management focus with the Company actively seeking to settle claims, leading to favorable development.

Fair value is defined in ASC Topic 820 as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability and, therefore, represents an exit price, not an entry price. Fair value is the exit price in the principal market (or, if lacking a principal market, the most advantageous market) in which the reporting entity would transact. Fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement, and, as such, is determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The exit price objective of a fair value measurement applies regardless of the reporting entity s intent and/or ability to sell the asset or transfer the liability at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that are consistent with the market approach, the income approach and/or the cost approach. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets and liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, to a single present value amount on a discounted basis. The cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset, also known as current replacement cost. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value are to be consistently applied.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, together with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 We begin our discussion with an overview of our Company to give you an understanding of our business and the markets we serve. We then discuss our critical accounting policies. This is followed with a discussion of our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. This discussion includes an analysis of certain significant period-to-period variances in our consolidated statements of operations. Our cash flows and financial condition are discussed under the caption Liquidity and Capital Resources. 
 Business Overview 
 AMERISAFE is a holding company that markets and underwrites workers compensation insurance through its insurance subsidiaries. Workers compensation insurance covers statutorily prescribed benefits that employers are obligated to provide to their employees who are injured in the course and scope of their employment. Our business strategy is focused on providing this coverage to small to mid-sized employers engaged in hazardous industries, principally construction, trucking, logging and lumber, agriculture, manufacturing, telecommunications, and maritime. Employers engaged in hazardous industries pay substantially higher than average rates for workers compensation insurance compared to employers in other industries, as measured per payroll dollar. The higher premium rates are due to the nature of the work performed and the inherent workplace danger of our target employers. Hazardous industry employers also tend to have less frequent but more severe claims as compared to employers in other industries due to the nature of their businesses. We provide proactive safety reviews of employers workplaces. These safety reviews are a vital component of our underwriting process and also promote safer workplaces. We utilize intensive claims management practices that we believe permit us to reduce the overall cost of our claims. In addition, our audit services ensure that our policyholders pay the appropriate premiums required under the terms of their policies and enable us to monitor payroll patterns that cause underwriting, safety or fraud concerns. We believe that the higher premiums typically paid by our policyholders, together with our disciplined underwriting and safety, claims and audit services, provide us with the opportunity to earn attractive returns for our shareholders. 
 We actively market our insurance in 27 states through independent agencies (including retail and wholesale brokers and agents), as well as through our wholly owned insurance agency subsidiary. We are also licensed in an additional 20 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 Understanding our accounting policies is key to understanding our financial statements. Management considers some of these policies to be very important to the presentation of our financial results because they require us to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures. Some of the estimates result from judgments that can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results in future periods might differ from these estimates. 
 
 Management believes that the most critical accounting policies relate to the reporting of reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses, including losses that have occurred but have not been reported prior to the reporting date, amounts recoverable from reinsurers, premiums receivable, assessments, deferred policy acquisition costs, deferred income taxes, credit losses on investment securities, and share-based compensation. These critical accounting policies are more fully described in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Consolidated Results of Operations for Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to September 30, 2023 
 Gross Premiums Written . Gross premiums written for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were 74.9 million, compared to 70.8 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 5.8 . The increase was attributable to a 5.5 million increase in annual premiums on voluntary policies written during the period partially offset by a 1.6 million decrease in premiums resulting from payroll audits and related premium adjustments for policies written in previous quarters. 
 Net Premiums Written . Net premiums written for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were 71.0 million, compared to 66.7 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 6.4 . The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in gross premiums written. As a percentage of gross premiums earned, ceded premiums were 5.6 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 5.8 for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in ceded premiums as a percentage of gross premiums earned is a result of a change in our 2024 reinsurance treaties. For additional information, see Item 1, Business Reinsurance in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Net Premiums Earned . Net premiums earned for the third quarter of 2024 were 67.1 million, compared to 66.6 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 0.6 . The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in net premiums written during the period. 
 Net Investment Income . Net investment income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 7.5 million, compared to 8.1 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 7.6 . The decrease was due to lower average invested asset balances in the period compared to prior year. Average invested assets, including cash and cash equivalents, were 893.3 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to an average of 961.2 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 7.1 . The pre-tax investment yield on our investment portfolio was 3.4 per annum during the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The tax-equivalent yield on our investment portfolio was 3.8 per annum for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The tax-equivalent yield is calculated using the effective interest rate and the appropriate marginal tax rate. 
 Net Realized Gains (Losses) on Investments . Net realized gains on investments for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 0.2 million compared to net realized gains of 5.1 million for the same period in 2023. Net realized gains in the third quarter of 2024 were mostly attributable to the redemption of fixed maturity securities. Net realized gains in the third quarter of 2023 were mostly attributable to sales of equity and fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale. 
 24 

Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Equity Securities . The market value of our equity securities increased by 3.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a decrease of 7.3 million for the same period in 2023. 
 Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses Incurred . Loss and loss adjustment expenses (LAE) incurred totaled 39.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 37.2 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 2.0 million, or 5.4 . The current accident year loss and LAE incurred were 47.6 million compared to 47.3 million for the same period in 2023. Our initial estimate of the loss and LAE ratio for accident year 2024 remains unchanged at 71.0 of net premiums earned, consistent with the estimate initially set for accident year 2023, and is based on long-term claim frequency and severity trends, as well as medical inflation. We recorded favorable prior accident year development of 8.5 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to favorable prior accident year development of 10.2 million in the same period of 2023, as further discussed below in Prior Year Development. Our net loss ratio was 58.4 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 55.8 for the same period of 2023. 
 Underwriting and Certain Other Operating Costs, Commissions and Salaries and Benefits . Underwriting and certain other operating costs, commissions and salaries and benefits for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were 21.3 million, compared to 22.4 million for the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a 1.6 million decrease in profit sharing reinsurance commission recorded in prior year partially offset by a 0.7 million increase in compensation expense. Our expense ratio was 31.7 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 33.6 in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Income Tax Expense . Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.5 million, compared to 2.4 million for the same period in 2023. The effective tax rate for the Company for quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 19.5 compared to 19.2 in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in the effective tax rate is due to a lower proportion of income from tax-exempt investments for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period of 2023. 
 Consolidated Results of Operations for Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to September 30, 2023 
 Gross Premiums Written . Gross premiums written for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 231.4 million, compared to 225.0 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 2.8 . The increase was attributable to a 7.1 million increase in annual premiums on voluntary policies written during the period and a 0.9 million increase in residual market premiums . These increases were partially offset by a 1.5 million decrease in premiums resulting from payroll audits and related premium adjustments for policies written in previous quarters. 
 Net Premiums Written . Net premiums written for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 219.5 million, compared to 212.8 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 3.2 . The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in gross premiums written. As a percentage of gross premiums earned, ceded premiums were 5.5 for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 5.7 in the same period of 2023. The decrease in ceded premiums as a percentage of gross premiums earned is a result of a change in our 2024 reinsurance treaties. For additional information, see Item 1, Business Reinsurance in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Net Premiums Earned . Net premiums earned for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 204.1 million, compared to 201.4 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 1.3 . The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in net premiums written during the period. 
 Net Investment Income . Net investment income for the first nine months of 2024 was 22.3 million, compared to 23.3 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 4.1 . The decrease was due to lower average invested asset balances in the period compared to prior year as well as lower investment yields on fixed income securities and cash balances compared to prior year. Average invested assets, including cash and cash equivalents were 895.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an average of 962.1 million in the same period in 2023, a decrease of 6.9 . The pre-tax investment yield on our investment portfolio was 3.3 per annum during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The tax-equivalent yield on our investment portfolio was 3.8 per annum for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023. The tax-equivalent yield is calculated using the effective interest rate and the appropriate marginal tax rate. 
 Net Realized Gains (Losses) on Investments . Net realized losses on investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 0.2 million compared to net realized gains of 5.5 million for the same period in 2023. Net realized losses in the first nine months of 2024 were attributable to the sale of equity and fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale. Net realized gains in the first nine months of 2023 were attributable to the sale of equity securities. 
 Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Equity Securities . The market value of our equity securities increased by 8.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a decrease of 3.9 million for the same period in 2023. 
 25 

Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses Incurred . Loss and LAE incurred totaled 119.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 111.8 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 8.0 million, or 7.1 . The current accident year loss and LAE incurred were 144.9 million compared to 143.0 million for the same period in 2023. Our initial estimate of the loss and LAE ratio for accident year 2024 remains unchanged at 71.0 of net premiums earned, consistent with the estimate initially set for accident year 2023, and is based on long-term claim frequency and severity trends, as well as medical inflation. We recorded favorable prior accident year development of 25.2 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to favorable prior accident year development of 31.2 million in the same period of 2023, as further discussed below in Prior Year Development. Our net loss ratio was 58.7 in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 55.5 for the same period of 2023. 
 Underwriting and Certain Other Operating Costs, Commissions and Salaries and Benefits . Underwriting and certain other operating costs, commissions and salaries and benefits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 60.4 million, compared to 59.3 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 1.8 . This increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation expense of 2.2 million, a decrease in profit sharing reinsurance commission of 0.8 million and an increase in professional fees of 0.4 million. Offsetting these amounts were a decrease in insurance related assessments of 1.6 million and a 0.5 million decrease in taxes and fees. Our expense ratio was 29.6 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 29.5 for the same period of 2023. 
 Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 10.0 million, compared to 10.5 million for the same period in 2023. The effective tax rate for the Company decreased to 19.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 19.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the effective tax rate is due to a higher proportion of income from tax-exempt investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal sources of operating funds are premiums, investment income and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. Our primary uses of operating funds include payments of claims and operating expenses. Currently, we pay claims using cash flow from operations and invest the remaining funds. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 13.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which represented a 12.5 million decrease from 25.9 million in net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease in operating cash flow was due to a 12.8 million decrease in reinsurance recoveries, a 2.3 million increase in underwriting expenses paid, a 2.1 million decrease in net investment income and a 0.8 million increase in federal taxes paid. Partially offsetting these decreases were a 2.9 million increase in premium collections, a 1.8 million decrease in losses paid and a 0.6 million decrease in dividends paid to policyholders. 
 Net cash provided by investing activities was 38.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash used in investment activities of 7.4 million for the same period in 2023. Cash provided by sales and maturities of investments totaled 125.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 116.4 million for the same period in 2023. A total of 86.4 million in cash was used to purchase investments in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 123.3 million in purchases for the same period in 2023. A total of 0.8 million in cash was used to purchase property and equipment in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.5 million for the same period in 2023. 
 Net cash used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 27.0 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of 20.7 million for the same period in 2023. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 21.3 million of cash was used for dividends paid to shareholders compared to 19.7 million in the same period of 2023. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were repurchases of outstanding shares of our common stock of 5.1 million compared to none for the same period in 2023. Share-based compensation related payroll tax withholding was 0.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.9 million in the same period in 2023. 
 Investment Portfolio 
 Our investment portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents, totaled 899.2 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 0.3 from December 31, 2023. Purchases of fixed maturity securities are classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity at the time of purchase based on the individual security. The Company has the ability and positive intent to hold certain investments until maturity. Therefore, fixed maturity securities classified as held-to-maturity, as defined by FASB ASC Topic 320, Investments-Debt and Equity Securities , are recorded at amortized cost net of allowance for credit losses. Our equity securities and fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value.

Our debt securities classified as available-for-sale are marked to market as of the end of each calendar quarter. As of that date, unrealized gains and losses that are not credit related are recorded to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). Any available-for-sale credit related losses would be recognized as a credit loss allowance on the balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to earnings, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Both the credit loss allowance and adjustment to net income can be reversed if conditions change. 
 For our debt securities classified as held-to-maturity, non-credit related unrecognized gains and losses are not recorded in the financial statements until realized. Effective upon the adoption of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses, management is required to estimate held-to-maturity expected credit related losses and recognize a credit loss allowance on the balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to earnings. Any adjustments to the estimated expected credit related losses are recognized through earnings and adjustments to the credit loss allowance.

The number of open claims at September 30, 2024 decreased by 314 claims as compared to the number of open claims at September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2024, our incurred amounts for certain accident years, primarily 2017 through 2022, developed more favorably than management previously expected. The revisions to the Company s reserves reflect new information gained by claims adjusters in the normal course of adjusting claims and is reflected in the financial statements when the information becomes available. It is typical for more serious claims to take several years or longer to settle and the Company continually revises estimates as more information about claimants medical conditions and potential disability becomes known and the claims get closer to being settled. Multiple factors can cause both favorable and unfavorable loss development. The favorable loss development we experienced across accident years was largely due to favorable case reserve development from closed claims and claims where the worker had reached maximum medical improvement. 
 The assumptions we used in establishing our reserves were based on our historical claims data. However, as of September 30, 2024, actual results for certain accident years have been better than our assumptions would have predicted. We do not presently intend to modify our assumptions for establishing reserves in light of recent results. However, if actual results for current and future accident years are consistent with, or different than, our results in these recent accident years, our historical claims data will reflect this change and, over time, will impact the reserves we establish for future claims. 
 Our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses are inherently uncertain and our focus on providing workers compensation insurance to employers engaged in hazardous industries results in our receiving relatively fewer but more severe claims than many other workers compensation insurance companies. As a result of this focus on higher severity, lower frequency business, our reserve for loss and loss adjustment expenses may have greater volatility than other workers compensation insurance companies. For additional information, see Item 1, Business Loss Reserves in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Market risk is the risk of potential economic loss principally arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments. The major components of market risk affecting us are credit risk, interest rate risk, and equity price risk. We currently have no exposure to foreign currency risk. 
 Since December 31, 2023, there have been no material changes in the quantitative or qualitative aspect of our market risk profile. For additional information regarding the Company s exposure to certain market risks, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms specified by the SEC. We note that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving the stated goals under all potential future conditions. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent or detect all misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can only provide reasonable, not absolute assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to errors or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any within the Company, have been detected. 
 There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
