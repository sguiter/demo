The
Company s principal financial instruments subject to potential concentration of credit risk are cash and cash equivalents, including
amounts held in money market accounts. The Company places cash deposits with a federally insured financial institution. The Company maintains
its cash at banks and financial institutions it considers to be of high credit quality; however, the Company s domestic cash deposits
may at times exceed the insured limit. Balances in excess of insured limitations may not be insured. The Company has not experienced
losses on these accounts, and management believes that the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such accounts.

of cash and cash equivalents and working capital of approximately million as of September 30, 2024, which included
amounts due from related parties of million, and the Company generated a net loss of million during the three months ended
September 30, 2024. The Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of September 30, 2024 and negative cash flow
from operating activities during the period of . The Company does not have sustained and stable income, and there is also significant
uncertainty in regarding its income for the next 12 months. 

The
continuation of the Company as a going concern through the one-year period from the date on which this report is filed is dependent upon
continued financial support from its related parties or loans or investments by third parties, increasing its sales and the diversity
of its customer base. The Company is actively pursuing additional financing for its operations via potential loans and equity issuances.
However, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in securing sufficient funds to sustain its operations. 

Management
has determined that the above conditions indicate that it may be probable that the Company would not be able to meet its obligations
within one year after the date that this report is issued. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this report do not
include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities
that may result if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. To date the Company has financed its operations primarily
through equity investments and loans made by related parties and their affiliates in additional to loans from commercial banks and
third parties. The Company may also seek funding through public or private financings, collaborative arrangements, and other
possible means of financing. 

In
addition, the Company will seek to expand the yacht brands the Company can offer for sale, the territories in which the Company markets
its yachts and, if appropriate based on the Company s capabilities and what the Company can offer, seek to become the exclusive
distributor for yacht manufacturers in Taiwan and other territories. The Company will also seek to enter other areas related to the marine
industry where the Company believes it can be profitable.

Overview 

We
are a global yacht sales and service provider based in Taiwan focused on offering yachts, ancillary products, technical support, service
solutions and systematic management solutions to yacht marinas, yacht clubs, yacht operators and marine tourism providers. Our mission
is to offer our clients, which we refer to as yacht operators, more profitable products and comprehensive service solutions. We differentiate
ourselves from other yacht manufacturers by offering yachts specifically designed for marine tourism, group tours, business meetings,
yacht clubs and fractional ownership as opposed to individual owners. In addition to our products, we seek to support our customers by
providing maintenance and other yacht management services, yacht activity scenarios, business solutions and marketing strategies to enhance
yacht tourism and operational efficiencies to enable them to grow their businesses and improve their bottom lines. 

We
design and offer various yachts models which differ in their sizes, performance, and functions and are sold under our brand name, VIVIC. 
Our yachts are designed to be more suitable for multiple user group scenarios, emphasizing open deck and cabin space suitable for group
tours and business meetings, with improved operational economies and energy efficiencies. We collaborate with our marketing agents, encouraging
them to develop yacht marinas and seek out yacht operators interested in developing their own businesses based upon yacht sharing. 

Our
yachts are manufactured by third parties selected by us on the basis of their production capabilities, technical ability and financial
wherewithal. Once a customer places an order, we negotiate and sign an original equipment manufacturer OEM contract with
a selected local manufacturer. Upon completion, we deliver the boat to the location designated by our customer. Our principal supplier
and distributor in mainland China is Guangdong Weiguan Ship Technology Co., Ltd., which utilizes the mainland s production and
supply chain advantages to provide us with yacht production, delivery, and after-sales services based on our designs. Guangdong Weiguan
is responsible for providing the required products and after-sales services for all sales orders in mainland China and remits 15 of
the order amount of each yacht to us as a VIVIC brand usage fee. 

In
addition to our own yachts, we are the exclusive distributor of Monte Fino yachts in the People s Republic of China, the Philippines
and the Middle East pursuant to our agreement with Kha Shing Enterprise Co., Ltd. (Taiwan) Kha Shing ). While seeking to
develop the market for sales to tour operators, we will also seek to increase sales of Monte Fino luxury yachts in the territories where
we are the exclusive distributor, particularly in the 40- to 70-foot range, which are generally purchased by individual private yacht
owners. 

21 

As
our Company grows, we will seek to expand the yacht brands we offer for sale, the territories in which we market yachts and, if appropriate
based on our capabilities and what we can offer, seek to become the exclusive distributor for yacht manufacturers in Taiwan and other
territories. We will also seek to enter other areas related to the marine industry where we believe we can be profitable 

Results
of Operations 

In
2023, we determined to focus our efforts on yacht sales in Taiwan and other selected regions throughout the world, and since that time
have disposed of all of our business operations in mainland China. On July 12, 2023, our subsidiary, Vivic Corporation (Hong Kong) Co.
Limited Vivic Hong Kong ), entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Yun-Kuang Kung pursuant to which Mr. Kung acquired
all of the shares of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Guangdong Weiguan Ship Tech Co., Ltd. Weiguan Ship ). The divestiture
of Weiguan Ship completed our plan to divest of all activities other than our ongoing yacht business in Taiwan. 

Our
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this report have been prepared assuming that we will continue as
a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and
classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. 

As
a result of the sale of our interest in Weiguan Ship and its subsidiaries, the assets and related liabilities and the results of operations
of such entities are included our financial statements as discontinued operations. The following table sets forth the results of our
operations for the periods indicated as a percentage of net sales. Certain columns may not add due to rounding.

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the going concern basis of accounting,
which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. 

The
Company had 213,259 of cash and cash equivalents and working capital of approximately 4.0 million as of September 30, 2024, which included
amounts due from related parties of 2.5 million. The Company generated a net loss of 0.6 million during the three months ended September
30, 2024, and the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately 2.9 million as of September 30, 2024, and generated negative cash
flow from operating activities during the period of 129,776. The Company does not have sustained
and stable income, and there is also significant uncertainty in regarding its income for the next 12 months. 

24 

The
continuation of the Company as a going concern through the one-year anniversary of the date of this filing is dependent upon continued
financial support from its related parties and loans or investments from third parties. The Company is actively pursuing additional financing
for its operations through loans and the sale of equity. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in securing
sufficient funds to sustain its operations. 

Management
has determined that the above conditions indicate that it may be probable that the Company would not be able to meet its obligations
within one year after the date of issuance of this report. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report do not
include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities
that may result in the Company not being able to continue as a going concern. 

PLAN
OF OPERATION AND FUNDING 

We
expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds, cash generated from
operations, loans from and further issuances of securities to, our principal shareholders. Our working capital requirements are expected
to increase in line with the growth of our business. 

Existing
working capital, further advances and the issuance of debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund
our operations over the next six months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements apart from amounts outstanding
under our SBA Loan and our loan with Taiwan Hua Nan Bank. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the
private placement of equity and debt instruments to our principal shareholders. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates
additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) developmental expenses associated with our business
and (ii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of equity securities and debt instruments. Thereafter,
we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances
of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current stockholders. Further, such securities might have rights,
preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate
funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors
or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. 

MATERIAL
COMMITMENTS 

As
of the date of this report, we do not have any material commitments. 

OFF-BALANCE
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

As
of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a
current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

Our
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported the amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. Accounting policies are critical and necessary to account
for the material estimates and assumptions on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. For further information on
all of our significant accounting policies, see the Notes to unaudited condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of
this Report. 

25 

Revenue recognition 

In
accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , the Company recognizes revenues when goods or services
are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those
goods or services. In determining when and how revenues are recognized from contracts with customers, the Company performs the following
five-step analysis: (i) identification of contract with customer (ii) determination of performance obligations (iii) measurement
of the transaction price (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations, and (v) recognition of revenues
when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. The Company derives revenues from the processing, distribution, and sale
of its products. 

Credit losses 

On
January1, 2023, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2016-13 Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic
326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected
loss methodology that is referred to as the current expected credit loss CECL methodology. The adoption of the
credit loss accounting standard has no material impact on the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
as of January 1, 2023. 

The
Company s account receivables and other receivables in the balance sheet are within the scope of ASC Topic 326. As the Company
has limited customers and debtors, the Company uses the loss-rate method to evaluates the expected credit losses on an individual basis.
When establishing the loss rate, the Company makes the assessment on various factors, including historical experience, credit-worthiness
of customers and debtors, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, and other
factors that may affect its ability to collect from the customers and debtors. The Company also provides specific provisions for allowance
when facts and circumstances indicate that the receivable is unlikely to be collected. 

Expected
credit losses are recorded as allowance for credit losses on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. After
all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the receivable is written off against the allowance. In the event the Company
recovers amount that is previously reserved for, the Company will reduce the specific allowance for credit losses. 

Accounts receivable 

Accounts
receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest and are due within contractual payment terms, generally 30 to
90 days from completion of service. Credit is extended based on an evaluation of a customer s financial condition, the customer s
credit-worthiness and payment history. Accounts receivable outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past
due. Past due balances over 90 days and over a specified amount are reviewed individually for collectability. Under the current expected
credit loss model, at the end of each period, the Company specifically evaluates each individual customer s financial condition,
credit history, and the current economic conditions to monitor the progress of the collection of accounts receivables. The Company considers
the allowance for doubtful accounts for any estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments.
For receivables that are past due or not being paid according to payment terms, appropriate actions are taken to collect the amounts
due, including seeking legal resolution in a court of law. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all reasonable
means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The Company does not have any off-balance-sheet
credit exposure related to its customers. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had no allowance for doubtful accounts. 

Income taxes 

Income
taxes are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ASC 740 ). Under
this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
in the period that includes the enactment date. 

26 

ASC
740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements
uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the
financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax
positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of
being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts. 

The
Company is subject to tax in local and foreign jurisdiction. As a result of its business activities, the Company files tax returns that
are subject to examination by the relevant tax authorities. 

Related parties 

Parties,
which can be an entity or individual, are considered to be related if the Company has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control
the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operational decisions. Companies are also
considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence. 

Recent accounting pronouncements 

In
November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ASU
2023-07 ). The amendments in ASU 2023-07 improve reportable segment disclosure requirements through enhanced disclosures about
significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM). In addition, the amendments enhance
interim disclosure requirements, clarify circumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple segment measures of profit or loss, provide
new segment disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment, and contain other disclosure requirements. ASU 2023-07
will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2023-01 did not have a material impact on the Company s
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statement presentation or disclosures. 

In
December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ASU 2023-09 ),
which requires disclosures of incremental income tax information within the rate reconciliation and expanded disclosures of income taxes
paid, among other disclosure requirements. This ASU will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024. 

The
Company s management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, authoritative guidance, if currently
adopted, will have a material impact on the Company s financial statement presentation or disclosures.

evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) of the Exchange
Act) at September 30, 2024 was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer who also is
our Chief Financial Officer. Based on his evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, he concluded that at September 30, 2024,
such disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. This was due to our limited resources, including the absence of a financial
staff with accounting and financial expertise and deficiencies in the design or operation of our internal control over financial reporting
that adversely affected our disclosure controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses. 

We
plan to designate individuals responsible for identifying reportable developments and to implement procedures designed to remediate the
material weakness by focusing additional attention and resources in our internal accounting functions at such time as such actions can
be properly supported by the financial results of our operations. However, there is no assurance as to when we will undertake to hire
the personnel and implement the procedures necessary to remediate the material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures and
the material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period of time
and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
under the Exchange Act, during our most recently completed fiscal quarter which is the subject of this report that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
