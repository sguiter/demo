Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

This
report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ).
All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements for purposes of this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q, including, without limitation, any projections of earnings, revenue or other financial items, any statements of the plans
and objectives of management for future operations (including, but not limited to, pre-clinical development, clinical trials, manufacturing
and commercialization), uncertainties and assumptions regarding any continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations,
clinical trials, supply chain, strategy, goals and anticipated timelines, any statements concerning proposed drug candidates, potential
therapeutic benefits, or other new products or services, any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance, any changes
in the course of research and development activities and in clinical trials, any possible changes in cost and timing of development and
testing, capital structure, financial condition, working capital needs and other financial items, and any statements of assumptions underlying
any of the foregoing. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified using terminology such as may, will, 
 expects, plans, anticipates, estimates, potential or continue, 
or the negative thereof or other comparable terminology. Although we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions
within the bounds of our knowledge of our industry, business, and operations, we cannot guarantee that actual results will not differ
materially from our expectations. 

Our
future financial condition and results of operations, as well as any forward-looking statements, are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties,
including, but not limited to, the inherent uncertainty in the drug development process, our ability to raise additional capital to fund
our planned future operations, our ability to obtain or maintain U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA and foreign regulatory
approvals for our drug candidates, our ability to enroll patients in our clinical trials, risks relating to third parties conduct
of our clinical trials, risks relating to government, private health insurers and other third-party payers coverage or reimbursement,
risks relating to commercial potential of a drug candidate in development, changes in technologies for the treatment of cancer, impact
of development of competitive drug candidates by others, risks relating to intellectual property, volatility in the market price of our
common stock, potential inability to maintain compliance with The Nasdaq Marketplace Rules and the impact of adverse capital and credit
market conditions. These and other risks and assumptions are described in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and in other documents that we file or furnish with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may
vary materially from those indicated or anticipated by such forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements speak only as
of the date they are made, and we do not intend to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law or applicable regulations.
We operate in a highly competitive, highly regulated, and rapidly changing environment and our business is in a state of evolution. Therefore,
it is likely that new risks will emerge, and that the nature and elements of existing risks will change, over time. It is not possible
for management to predict all such risk factors or changes therein, or to assess either the impact of all such risk factors on our business
or the extent to which any individual risk factor, combination of factors, or new or altered factors, may cause results to differ materially
from those contained in any forward-looking statement. 

Except
where the context otherwise requires, in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company, Imunon, we, 
 us, and our refer to Imunon, Inc., a Delaware corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries.

NOTES
TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED 

 FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS 

 (UNAUDITED) 

SEPTEMBER
30, 2024 

Going
Concern Uncertainty. 

Since
inception, the Company has incurred substantial operating losses, principally from expenses associated with the Company s
research and development programs, clinical trials conducted in connection with the Company s drug candidates, and
applications and submissions to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA ). The Company has not generated significant
revenue and has incurred significant net losses in each year since inception. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the
Company had a net loss of 
million and used 
million cash to fund operations. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has incurred approximately 
million of cumulative net losses. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 
million in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and interest receivable to fund its operations. 

On
July 30, 2024, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the July 2024 Purchase Agreement with
certain institutional and accredited investors (each, a Purchaser and collectively, the Purchasers ),
pursuant to which the Company issued, in a registered direct offering, an aggregate of shares
of the Company s common stock at an offering price of per
share for gross proceeds of million
before the deduction of placement agent fees and offering expenses. In a concurrent private placement (together with the registered
direct offering, the July 2024 Offering and also pursuant to the July 2024 Purchase Agreement, the Company issued to
the purchasers unregistered warrants (the Warrants to purchase an aggregate of shares
of common stock at an exercise price of per
share. The warrants were exercisable immediately after issuance for a term of five and one-half years following the date of
issuance. The closing of the July 2024 Offering occurred on August 1, 2024. 

The
Company s ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the
recent disruptions to, and volatility in, financial markets in the U.S., the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the unrest in the Middle
East. The Company continues to monitor its operating activities in light of these events, and it is possible that these events could
result in a variety of risks to the business. The specific impact, if any, is not readily determinable as of the date of these condensed
consolidated financial statements. 

The
Company has based its estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong. The Company may need to obtain additional funds sooner or
in greater amounts than it currently anticipates. Potential sources of financing include strategic relationships, public or private sales
of the Company s shares or debt, the sale of the Company s New Jersey net operating losses and other sources. If the Company
raises funds by selling additional shares of common stock or other securities convertible into common stock, the ownership interest of
existing stockholders may be diluted. 

The
actual amount of funds the Company will need to operate is subject to many factors, some of which are beyond the Company s control.
These factors include the progress of research activities; the number and scope of research programs; the progress of preclinical and
clinical development activities; the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom the Company has entered into research and
development agreements; the costs associated with additional clinical trials of drug candidates; the ability to achieve milestones under
licensing arrangements; the costs involved in prosecuting and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights; and the
costs and timing of regulatory approvals. 

A
fundamental component of the ability to continue as a going concern is the Company s ability to raise capital as required, as to
which no assurances can be provided. To address the additional funding requirements of the Company, management has undertaken the following
initiatives: 

it
 has assessed its current expenditures and will be reducing the current spending requirements where necessary; 

it
 may pursue additional capital funding in the public and private markets through equity sales and/or debt facilities; 

it
 may pursue possible partnerships and collaborations; and 

it
 may pursue potential out licensing for its drug candidates. 

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern may depend on the Company s ability to raise additional capital, attain
further operating efficiencies, reduce expenditures, and, ultimately, to generate revenue. There are no assurances that these future
funding and operating efforts will be successful. If management is unsuccessful in these efforts, the Company s current capital
is not expected to be sufficient to fund the Company s operations for the next twelve months. 

and 
shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the three-month and nine-month periods ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, diluted loss per common share was the same as basic loss per common share as the other warrants, and equity awards
that were convertible into shares of the Company s common stock were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per common share
as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. The Company did not pay any dividends during the first nine months of 2024 or 2023. 

as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively,
consisted of U.S. Treasury securities and corporate debt securities. These investments are valued at estimated fair value, with unrealized
gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive loss. 

The
Company reviews its debt securities classified as short-term investments on a regular basis for impairment. For debt securities in unrealized
loss positions, the Company determines whether any portion of the decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is due to credit-related
factors if it neither intends to sell nor anticipates that it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell prior to recovery
of the amortized cost basis. The Company considers factors such as the extent to which the market value has been less than the cost,
any noted failure of the issuer to make scheduled payments, changes to the rating of the security and other relevant credit-related factors
in determining whether or not a credit loss exists. During the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, the Company did not recognize an allowance
for credit-related losses on any of its investments.

million loan facility (the SVB Loan Facility with Silicon Valley Bank SVB ).
Imunon immediately drew down million from the SVB Loan Facility and used the funds to retire all outstanding indebtedness with Horizon
Technology Finance Corporation pursuant to a loan agreement entered into on June 27, 2018, under which the Company had drawn down 
million and repaid million in August 2020. Concurrently with this transaction, the Company used million of other available funds
to establish a restricted cash account which served as security for the SVB Loan Facility. 

The
SVB Loan Facility was in the form of money market secured indebtedness bearing interest at a calculated WSJ prime-based variable rate.
A final payment equal to of the total million commitment amount was due upon maturity or prepayment of the SVB Loan Facility.
There was no facility commitment fee, and no stock or warrants were issued to SVB. Payments under the loan agreement were interest only
for the first 24 months after loan closing, followed by a 24-month amortization period of principal and interest through the scheduled
maturity date. 

In
connection with the SVB Loan Facility, the Company incurred financing fees and expenses totaling which was recorded and classified
as debt discount and was amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the loan. Also, in connection
with the SVB Loan Facility, the Company was required to pay an end-of-term fee equal to of the original loan amount at time of maturity.
Therefore, these amounts totaling were amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the
loan. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred interest expense of and amortized , as interest
expense for debt discounts and end-of-term fee in connection with the SVB Loan Facility. 

On
April 21, 2023, the Company repaid the outstanding principal balance, an early termination fee and the end-of-term charges in full satisfaction
of the SVB Loan Facility. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a loss of on the early termination of the SVB Loan Facility which
represented the early termination fee and the end of the term fees, net of previously amortized interest expense totaling on
the date of its payoff.

Overview 

Imunon
is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on advancing a portfolio of innovative treatments that harness the body s natural
mechanisms with the aim to generate safe, effective and durable responses across a broad array of human diseases, constituting a differentiating
approach from conventional therapies. Imunon is developing its non-viral DNA technology across its modalities. The first modality, TheraPlas ,
is developed for the coding of proteins and cytokines in the treatment of solid tumors where an immunological approach is deemed promising.
The second modality, PlaCCine , is developed for the coding of viral antigens that can elicit a strong immunological response.
This technology may represent a promising platform for the development of vaccines in infectious diseases. 

The
Company s lead clinical program, IMNN-001, is a DNA-based immunotherapy for the localized treatment of advanced ovarian cancer
that has completed its Phase II clinical studies. IMNN-001 works by instructing the body to produce safe and durable levels of powerful
cancer-fighting molecules, such as interleukin-12 and interferon gamma, at the tumor site. Additionally, the Company has entered into
a first-in-human study of its COVID-19 booster vaccine (IMNN-101). We will continue to leverage these modalities and to advance the technological
frontier of plasmid DNA to better serve patients with difficult-to-treat conditions. 

Technology
Platform 

Imunon s
technology platform is optimized for the delivery of DNA and mRNA therapeutics via synthetic non-viral carriers and is capable of providing
cell transfection for double-stranded DNA plasmids and large therapeutic RNA segments such as mRNA. There are two components to the system,
a backbone with plasmid DNA or mRNA payload encoding therapeutic proteins, or pathogen antigens or tumor associated antigens or cancer
neoantigens and a delivery system. The delivery system is designed to protect the DNA/mRNA from degradation and promote trafficking into
cells and through intracellular compartments. We designed the delivery system by chemically modifying the low molecular weight polymer
to improve its gene transfer activity without increasing toxicity. We believe that our non-viral DNA technology may be a viable alternative
to current approaches to gene delivery due to several distinguishing characteristics, including enhanced molecular versatility that allows
for complex modifications to potentially improve activity and safety. 

The
biocompatibility of these polymers reduces the risk of adverse immune response, thus allowing for repeated administration. Compared to
naked DNA or cationic lipids, we believe that our delivery systems are generally more efficient, cost effective and have a more favorable
safety profile. We believe that these advantages place Imunon in a position to capitalize on this technology platform.

THERAPLAS
MODALITY: IMNN-001 DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM 

Ovarian
Cancer Overview 

Ovarian
cancer is the most lethal of gynecological malignancies among women with more than 60 of women dying within five years of diagnosis. This
poor outcome is due in part to the lack of effective prevention and early detection strategies. There were approximately 20,000 new cases
of ovarian cancer in the U.S. in 2021 with an estimated 13,000 deaths. Mortality rates for ovarian cancer declined very little in the
last 40 years due to the unavailability of detection tests and improved treatments. Most women with ovarian cancer are not diagnosed
until Stages III or IV, when the disease has spread outside the pelvis to the abdomen and areas beyond, causing swelling and pain. The
five-year survival rates for Stages III and IV are 41 and 20 , respectively, there remains a need for a therapy that not only reduces
the recurrence rate but also meaningfully improves overall survival. Patients whose cancer recurs or progresses after initially responding
to surgery and first-line chemotherapy have been divided into one of the two groups based on the time from completion of platinum therapy
to disease recurrence or progression. This time period is referred to as platinum-free interval. The platinum-sensitive group has a platinum-free
interval of longer than six months. This group generally responds to additional treatment with platinum-based therapies. The platinum-resistant
group has a platinum-free interval of shorter than six months and is resistant to additional platinum-based treatments. Pegylated liposomal
doxorubicin, topotecan, and bevacizumab are the only approved second-line therapies for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. The overall
response rate for these therapies is 10 to 20 with median overall survival OS of 11 to 12 months. Additionally, 10 
to 15 of ovarian cancer cases nationwide are a result of germline or somatic BRCA mutations. With cognizance of tumor genetics, practice
has shifted to include targeted agents in ovarian cancer treatment. 

Poly
(ADP-ribose) polymerase PARP enzymes are responsible for detecting and repairing single-stranded and double-stranded
DNA breaks during cell replication. BRCA1/2 mutations hinder the homologous recombination repair pathway, and tumor cells utilize PARP
enzymes to repair DNA. For this reason, these tumors are particularly sensitive to the mechanism of PARP inhibitors. PARP inhibitors
have expanded treatment options in ovarian cancer, but few treatment options are left for women who are not eligible to receive PARP
inhibitors. 

Immunotherapy
is an attractive, novel approach for the treatment of ovarian cancer particularly since ovarian cancers are considered immunogenic tumors.
Interleukin-12 IL-12 is one of the most active cytokines for the induction of potent anti-cancer immunity acting through
the induction of T-lymphocyte and natural killer cell proliferation. The precedence for a therapeutic role of IL-12 in ovarian cancer
is based on epidemiologic and preclinical data. 

IMNN-001
Immunotherapy 

IMNN-001
is a DNA-based immunotherapeutic drug candidate for the localized treatment of ovarian cancer by intraperitoneally administering an IL-12
plasmid formulated with our proprietary TheraPlas delivery system. In this DNA-based approach, the immunotherapy is combined with a standard
chemotherapy drug, which can potentially achieve better clinical outcomes than with chemotherapy alone. We believe that increases in
IL-12 concentrations at tumor sites for several days after a single administration could create a potent immune environment against tumor
activity and that a direct killing of the tumor with concomitant use of cytotoxic chemotherapy could result in a more robust and durable
antitumor response than chemotherapy alone. We believe the rationale for local therapy with IMNN-001 is based on the following: 

Loco-regional
 production of the potent cytokine IL-12 avoids toxicities and poor pharmacokinetics associated with systemic delivery of recombinant
 IL-12; 

Persistent
 local delivery of IL-12 lasts up to one week and dosing can be repeated; and 

Local
 therapy is ideal for long-term maintenance therapy. 

20 

OVATION
1 Study . In February 2015, we announced that the FDA accepted the Phase I dose-escalation clinical trial of IMNN-001 in combination
with the standard of care in neoadjuvant ovarian cancer (the OVATION 1 Study ). The OVATION 1 Study was designed to: 

identify
 a tolerable and therapeutically active dose of IMNN-001 within certain safety parameters by recruiting and maximizing an immune response; 

enroll
 three to six patients per dose level and evaluate safety and efficacy; and 

attempt
 to define an optimal dose for a follow-on Phase I/II study. 

In
addition, the OVATION 1 Study established a unique opportunity to assess how cytokine-based compounds such as IMNN-001 directly affect
ovarian cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment in newly diagnosed ovarian cancer patients. The study was designed to characterize
the nature of the immune response triggered by IMNN-001 at various levels of the patients immune system, including: 

Infiltration
 of cancer fighting T-cell lymphocytes into primary tumor and tumor microenvironment including peritoneal cavity, which is the primary
 site of metastasis of ovarian cancer; 

Changes
 in local and systemic levels of immuno-stimulatory and immune-suppressive cytokines associated with tumor suppression and growth,
 respectively; and 

Expression
 profile of a comprehensive panel of immune related genes in pre-treatment and IMNN-001-treated tumor tissue. 

During
2016 and 2017, we announced data from the first 14 patients in the OVATION 1 Study. On October 3, 2017, we announced final translational
research and clinical data from the OVATION 1 Study. 

Key
translational research findings from all evaluable patients were consistent with the earlier reports from partial analysis of the data
and are summarized below: 

The
 intraperitoneal treatment of IMNN-001 in conjunction with standard-of-care neoadjuvant chemotherapy NACT resulted
 in dose-dependent increases in IL-12 and Interferon-gamma (IFN levels that were predominantly in the peritoneal fluid compartment
 with little to no changes observed in the patients systemic circulation. These and other post-treatment changes including
 decreases in VEGF levels in peritoneal fluid were consistent with an IL-12 based immune mechanism; 

Consistent
 with the previous partial reports, the effects observed in the Immunohistochemistry analysis were pronounced decreases in the density
 of immunosuppressive T-cell signals (Foxp3, PD-1, PDL-1, IDO-1) and increases in CD8+ cells in the tumor microenvironment; 

The
 ratio of CD8+ cells to immunosuppressive cells was increased in approximately 75 of patients, suggesting an overall shift in the
 tumor microenvironment from immunosuppressive to pro-immune stimulatory following treatment with IMNN-001. An increase in CD8+ to
 immunosuppressive T-cell populations was a leading indicator and believed to be a good predictor of improved OS; and 

Analysis
 of peritoneal fluid by cell sorting, not reported before, showed a treatment-related decrease in the percentage of immunosuppressive
 T-cell (Foxp3+), which was consistent with the reduction of Foxp3+ T-cells in the primary tumor tissue, and a shift in tumor na ve
 CD8+ cell population to more efficient tumor killing memory effector CD8+ cells. 

21 

The
Company also reported encouraging clinical data from the first 14 patients who completed treatment in the OVATION 1 Study. IMNN-001 plus
standard chemotherapy produced no dose-limiting toxicities and positive dose dependent efficacy signals which correlate well with positive
surgical outcomes as summarized below: 

Of
 the 14 patients treated in the entire study, two patients demonstrated a complete response, 10 patients demonstrated a partial response,
 and two patients demonstrated stable disease, as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors RECIST criteria. This translated to a 100 disease control rate and an 86 objective response rate ORR ). Of the five patients
 treated in the highest dose cohort, there was a 100 ORR with one complete response and four partial responses; 

14
 patients had successful resections of their tumors, with nine patients (64 having a complete tumor resection R0 ),
 which indicates a microscopically margin-negative resection in which no gross or microscopic tumor remains in the tumor bed. Seven
 out of eight (88 patients in the highest two dose cohorts experienced a R0 surgical resection. All five patients treated at the
 highest dose cohort experienced a R0 surgical resection; and 

All
 patients experienced a clinically significant decrease in their CA-125 protein levels as of their most recent study visit. CA-125
 was used to monitor certain cancers during and after treatment. CA-125 was present in greater concentrations in ovarian cancer cells
 than in other cells. 

On
March 26, 2020, the Company announced with Medidata Solutions, a subsidiary of Dassault Syst mes, that examining matched patient
data provided by Medidata in a synthetic control arm SCA with results from the Company s completed Phase Ib dose-escalating
OVATION 1 Study showed positive results in progression-free survival PFS ). The hazard ratio HR was 0.53
in the intent-to-treat ITT group, showing strong signals of efficacy. In its March 2019 discussion with the Company,
the FDA noted that preliminary findings from the Phase Ib OVATION 1 Study were exciting but lacked a control group to evaluate IMNN-001 s
independent impact on impressive tumor response, surgical results and PFS. The FDA encouraged the Company to continue its IMNN-001 development
program and consult with FDA with new findings that may have a bearing on designations such as Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy. 

SCAs
have the potential to revolutionize clinical trials in certain oncology indications and some other diseases where randomized control
is not ethical or practical. SCAs are formed by carefully selecting control patients from historical clinical trials to match the demographic
and disease characteristics of the patients treated with the new investigational product. SCAs have been shown to mimic the results of
traditional randomized controls so that the treatment effects of an investigational product can be visible by comparison to the SCA.
SCAs can help advance the scientific validity of single arm trials, and in certain indications, reduce time and cost, and expose fewer
patients to placebos or existing standard-of-care treatments that might not be effective for them. 

On
July 29, 2021, the Company announced final PFS results from the OVATION 1 Study published in the Journal of Clinical Cancer Research.
Median PFS in patients treated per protocol (n=14) was 21 months and was 18.4 months for the ITT population (n=18) for all dose cohorts,
including three patients who dropped out of the study after 13 days or less, and two patients who did not receive full NACT and IMNN-001
cycles. Under the current standard of care, in women with Stage III/IV ovarian cancer undergoing NACT, their disease progresses within
about 12 months on average. The results from the OVATION 1 Study supported continued evaluation of IMNN-001 based on promising tumor
response, as reported in the PFS data, and the ability for surgeons to completely remove visible tumors at interval debulking surgery.
IMNN-001 was well tolerated, and no dose-limiting toxicities were detected in the OVATION 1 Study. Intraperitoneal administration of
IMNN-001 was feasible with broad patient acceptance. 

OVATION
2 Study. The Company held an Advisory Board Meeting on September 27, 2017 with the clinical investigators and scientific experts
including those from Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Vanderbilt University Medical School, and M.D. Anderson Cancer Center to review and
finalize clinical, translational research and safety data from the OVATION 1 Study to determine the next steps forward for our IMNN-001
immunotherapy program. On November 13, 2017, the Company filed its Phase I/II clinical trial protocol with the FDA for IMNN-001 for the
localized treatment of ovarian cancer. The protocol was designed with a single dose escalation phase to 100 mg/m to identify a
tolerable dose of IMNN-001 within certain safety parameters while maximizing an immune response. The Phase I portion of the study would
be followed by a continuation at the selected dose in approximately 110 patients randomized Phase II study. 

22 

In
the OVATION 2 Study, patients in the IMNN-001 treatment arm would receive IMNN-001 plus chemotherapy pre- and post-interval debulking
surgery IDS ). The OVATION 2 Study was designed to include up to 110 patients with Stage III/IV ovarian cancer, with 12
to 15 patients in the Phase I portion and up to 95 patients in Phase II. The sample size is consistent with a Phase II trial designed
to inform the design of a Phase III trial comparing IMNN-001 with neoadjuvant + adjuvant chemotherapy versus neoadjuvant + adjuvant chemotherapy
alone. The primary endpoint is PFS and the primary analysis would be conducted after at least 80 events had been observed or after all
patients had been followed for at least 16 months, whichever was later. 

In
March 2020, the Company announced encouraging initial clinical data from the first 15 patients enrolled in the Phase I portion of the
OVATION 2 Study for patients newly diagnosed with Stage III and IV ovarian cancer. The OVATION 2 Study was designed to combine IMNN-001,
the Company s IL-12 gene-mediated immunotherapy, with standard-of-care NACT. Following NACT, patients would undergo IDS, followed
by three additional cycles of chemotherapy. 

IMNN-001
plus standard-of-care NACT produced positive dose-dependent efficacy results, with no dose-limiting toxicities, which correlates well
with successful surgical outcomes as summarized below: 

Of
 the 15 patients treated in the Phase I portion of the OVATION 2 Study, nine patients were treated with IMNN-001 at a dose of 100
 mg/m plus NACT and six patients were treated with NACT only. All 15 patients had successful resections of their tumors, with
 eight out of nine patients (88 in the IMNN-001 treatment arm having an R0 resection. Only three out of six patients (50 in the
 NACT only treatment arm had a R0 resection. 

When
 combining these results with the surgical resection rates observed in the Company s OVATION 1 Study, a population of patients
 with inclusion criteria identical to the OVATION 2 Study, the data reflected the strong dose-dependent efficacy of adding IMNN-001
 to the current standard of care NACT:

The
 ORR as measured by RECIST criteria for the 0, 36, 47 mg/m dose IMNN-001 patients were comparable, as expected, to the higher
 (61, 79, 100 mg/m dose IMNN-001 patients, with both groups demonstrating an approximate 80 ORR. 

On
March 23, 2020, the Company announced that the European Medicines Agency (the EMA Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products COMP had recommended that IMNN-001 be designated as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of ovarian cancer.
IMNN-001 previously received orphan designation from the FDA. 

In
February 2021, the Company announced that it had received Fast Track designation from the FDA for IMNN-001 and also provided an update
on the OVATION 2 Study. The Company reported that approximately one-third, or 34 patients, of the anticipated 110 patients had been enrolled
into the OVATION 2 Study, of which 20 were in the treatment arm and 14 were in the control. Of the 34 patients enrolled in the trial,
27 patients have had their IDS with the following results: 

80 
 of patients treated with IMNN-001 had a R0 resection. 

58 
 of patients in the control arm had an R0 resection. 

These
 interim data represented a 38 improvement in R0 resection rates for IMNN-001 patients compared with control arm patients and was
 consistent with the reported improvement in resection scores noted in the encouraging Phase I OVATION 1 Study, the manuscript of
 which was submitted for peer review publication. 

23 

In
June 2022, the Company announced that following a pre-planned interim safety review of 87 as treated patients (46 patients in the experimental
arm and 41 patients in the control arm) randomized in the OVATION 2 Study, the Data Safety Monitoring Board DSMB unanimously
recommended that the OVATION 2 Study continue treating patients with the dose of 100 mg/m2. The DSMB also determined that safety was
satisfactory, with an acceptable risk/benefit, and that patients tolerated IMNN-001 during a course of treatment that would last up to
six months. No dose-limiting toxicities were reported at this point in the OVATION 2 Study. Interim clinical data from patients who had
undergone IDS showed that the IMNN-001 treatment arm was continuing to show improvement in R0 surgical resection rates and CRS 3 chemotherapy
response scores over the control arm. The chemotherapy response score is a three-tier standardized scoring system for histological tumor
regression into complete/near complete (CRS 3), partial (CRS 2) and no/minimal (CRS 1) response based on omental examination. 

In
September 2022, the Company announced that its Phase I/II OVATION 2 Study with IMNN-001 in advanced ovarian cancer had completed enrollment
with 113 patients. 

In
September 2023, the Company announced interim PFS and OS data with IMNN-001 in its Phase I/II OVATION 2 Study. Interim clinical data
from the ITT population showed efficacy trends in PFS, demonstrating a delay in disease progression in the treatment arm of approximately
33 compared with the control arm, with the hazard ratio nearing the required value. Preliminary OS data followed a similar trend, showing
an approximate 9-month improvement in the treatment arm over the control arm. 

Subgroup
analyses showed patients treated with a PARP inhibitor PARPi as maintenance therapy had longer PFS and OS if they were
also treated with IMNN-001 compared with patients treated with NACT only. This was not a pre-specified subgroup as PARP inhibitors were
approved after the OVATION 2 Study was initiated. 

The
 median PFS in the PARPi + NACT group and the PARPi + NACT + IMNN-001 group was 15.7 months and 23.7 months, respectively. 

The
 median OS in the PARPi + NACT group was 45.6 months and has not yet been reached in the PARPi + NACT + IMNN-001 group. 

Imunon
also continues to see benefits in other secondary endpoints including an approximately 20 higher R0 tumor resection score and a doubling
of the CRS 3 chemotherapy response score to approximately 30 in the treatment arm versus 14 in the control arm. Chemotherapy response
score is considered a good prognostic indicator in ovarian cancer. The DSMB determined that safety analyses continue to show good tolerability
of IMNN-001 in this setting. 

In
June 2024, the Company announced database lock for the OVATION 2 Study. At that time, median OS and PFS had been reached, and all patients
in the open-label study had achieved treatment observation duration of 16 months, as required per protocol to evaluate efficacy. On July
11, 2024, a scientific advisory board with DSMB members, principal investigators, and scientific experts was held to review efficacy
and safety data from the OVATION 2 study. 

On
July 30, 2024, the Company announced positive topline results from the Phase II OVATION 2 Study. Highlights from patients treated with
IMNN-001 plus standard-of-care in a first-line treatment setting include: 

An
 11.1 month increase in median OS compared with standard-of-care alone in the ITT population. 

A
 hazard ratio in the ITT population of 0.74, which indicates a 35 improvement in survival. 

Among
 the approximately 90 of trial participants who received at least 20 of specified treatments per-protocol in both study arms, patients
 in the IMNN-001 arm had a 15.7 month increase in median OS, representing a further extension of life with a hazard ratio of 0.64,
 a 56 improvement in survival. 

For
 the nearly 40 of trial participants treated with a PARP inhibitor, the hazard ratio decreased further to 0.41, with median OS in
 the IMNN-001 treatment arm not yet reached at the time of database lock, compared with median OS of 37.1 months in the standard-of-care
 treatment arm. 

The
PFS results, the trial s primary endpoint, support the OS results with: 

A
 three-month improvement in PFS compared with standard-of-care alone. 

A
 hazard ratio in the intent-to-treat population of 0.79, indicating a 27 improvement in delaying progression for the IMNN-001 treatment
 arm. 

24 

As
a Phase II study, the OVATION 2 Study was not powered for statistical significance. Additional endpoints included objective response
rate, chemotherapy response score and surgical response. 

On
September 11, 2024 a scientific advisory board was held with DSMB members, principal investigators, and scientific experts to discuss
and seek input on the protocol synopsis for the Phase III trial. A protocol synopsis was submitted along with a briefing document for review
and input at the End-of-Phase II EOP2 meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration focused on the Phase III study. The EOP2 meeting
is scheduled to occur in the fourth quarter of 2024 and the Phase 3 trial is anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2025. The Company also plans to present full
OVATION 2 Study results at an upcoming medical conference and to submit the results for publication in a peer-reviewed medical journal. 

IMNN-001
in Combination with bevacizumab. In February 2023, the Company and Break Through Cancer, a public foundation dedicated
to supporting translational research in the most difficult-to-treat cancers that partners with top cancer research centers, announced
the commencement of patient enrollment in a collaboration to evaluate IMNN-001 in combination with bevacizumab in patients with advanced
ovarian cancer in the frontline, neoadjuvant clinical setting. 

This
Phase I/II study, titled Targeting Ovarian Cancer Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Using Immune and DNA Repair Directed Therapies, 
is expected to enroll 50 patients with Stage III/IV advanced ovarian cancer and is being led by principal investigator Amir Jazaeri,
M.D., Vice Chair for Clinical Research and Director of the Gynecologic Cancer Immunotherapy Program in the Department of Gynecologic
Oncology and Reproductive Medicine at MD Anderson. Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns
Hopkins and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center will also be participating in the trial. In addition, The Koch Institute for Integrative
Cancer Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) will provide artificial intelligence services including biomarker
and genomic analysis. 

Patients
are being randomized 1:1 in a two-arm trial. In October 2023, the first patient began treatment at University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer
Center in the Phase I/II Clinical Trial Evaluating IMNN-001 in Combination with Bevacizumab in Advanced Ovarian Cancer. The trial s
primary endpoint is detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) by second look laparoscopy (SLL), and the secondary endpoint is PFS.
SLL data are expected within one year following the completion of enrollment and final PFS data are expected approximately three years
following the completion of enrollment. This trial will also include a wealth of translational endpoints aimed at understanding the clonal
evolution and immunogenomic features of the MRD phase of ovarian cancer that is currently undetectable by imaging or tumor markers. 

As
of September 30, 2024, eight patients were enrolled in the Phase I portion of this study at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer
Center. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and John Hopkins Medicine Sidney Kimmel Cancer Care Center have been added as a clinical
site for this study. 

PLACCINE
DNA VACCINE MODALITY: IMNN-101 

In
January 2021, the Company announced the filing of a provisional U.S. patent application for a novel DNA-based, investigational vaccine
for preventing or treating infections from a broad range of infectious agents including the coronavirus disease using its PLACCINE DNA
vaccine modality PLACCINE ). The provisional patent covers a family of novel composition of multi-cistronic vectors and
polymeric nanoparticles that comprise the PLACCINE DNA vaccine platform technology for preventing or treating infectious agents that
have the potential for global pandemics, including the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its variations, using the Company s TheraPlas platform
technology. 

Imunon s
PLACCINE DNA vaccine modality is characterized by a single mono-cistronic or multi-cistronic DNA plasmid vector expressing single or
multiple pathogen antigens delivered with a synthetic delivery system. We believe it is adaptable to creating vaccines for a multitude
of pathogens, including emerging pathogens leading to pandemics as well as infectious diseases that have yet to be effectively addressed
with current vaccine technologies. This flexible vaccine platform is well supported by an established supply chain to produce any plasmid
vector and its assembly into a respective vaccine formulation. 

The
need for new vaccine technologies is urgent. Since 1980, more than 80 pathogenic viruses have been discovered, yet fewer than 4 have
a commercially available prophylactic vaccine. We have engaged with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority BARDA ),
a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, to consider certain pathogens BARDA has identified as the most urgent
and the most important. 

PLACCINE
is an extension of the Company s synthetic, non-viral TheraPlas delivery technology currently in a Phase II trial for the treatment
of late-stage ovarian cancer with IMNN-001. Imunon s proprietary multifunctional DNA vaccine technology concept is built on the
flexible PLACCINE technology platform that is amenable to rapidly responding to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as possible future mutations
of SARS-CoV-2, other future pandemics, emerging bioterrorism threats, and novel infectious diseases. Imunon s extensive experience
with TheraPlas suggests that the PLACCINE-based nanoparticles are stable at storage temperatures of 4 C to 25 C, making vaccines
developed on this platform easily suitable for broad world-wide distribution. 

25 

Imunon s
vaccine approach is designed to optimize the quality of the immune response dictating the efficiency of pathogen clearance and patient
recovery. Imunon has taken a multivalent approach in an effort to generate an even more robust immune response that not only results
in a strong neutralizing antibody response, but also a more robust and durable T-cell response. Delivered with Imunon s synthetic
polymeric system, the proprietary DNA plasmid is protected from degradation and its cellular uptake is facilitated. 

COVID-19
Vaccine Overview 

Emerging
data from the recent literature indicate that the quality of the immune response as opposed to its absolute magnitude is what dictates
SARSCoV-2 viral clearance and recovery and that an ineffective or non-neutralizing enhanced antibody response might actually exacerbate
disease. The first-generation COVID-19 vaccines were developed for rapid production and deployment and were not optimized for generating
cellular responses that result in effective viral clearance. Though early data have indicated some of these vaccines to be over 95 effective,
these first-generation vaccines were primarily designed to generate a strong antibody response, and while they have been shown to provide
prophylactic protection against disease, the durability of this protection is currently unclear. Most of these vaccines have been specifically
developed to target the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein (antigen), though it is known that restricting a vaccine to a sole viral antigen
creates selection pressure that can serve to facilitate the emergence of viral resistance. Indeed, even prior to full vaccine rollout,
it has been observed that the S protein is a locus for rapid evolutionary and functional change as evidenced by the D614G, Y453F, 501Y.V2,
and VUI-202012/01 mutations/deletions. This propensity for mutation of the S protein leads to future risk of efficacy reduction over
time as these mutations accumulate. 

Our
Next Generation Vaccine Initiative 

Imunon s
vaccine candidate comprises a single plasmid vector containing the DNA sequence encoding multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Delivery will
be evaluated intramuscularly, intradermally, or subcutaneously with a non-viral synthetic DNA delivery carrier that facilitates vector
delivery into the cells of the injected tissue and has potential immune adjuvant properties. Unique designs and formulations of Imunon
vaccine candidates may offer several potential key advantages. The synthetic polymeric DNA carrier is an important component of the vaccine
composition as it has the potential to facilitate the vaccine immunogenicity by improving vector delivery and, due to potential adjuvant
properties, attract professional immune cells to the site of vaccine delivery. 

Future
vaccine technology will need to address viral mutations and the challenges of efficient manufacturing, distribution, and storage. We
believe an adaptation of our TheraPlas technology, PLACCINE, has the potential to meet these challenges. Our approach is described in
our provisional patent filing and is summarized as a DNA vaccine technology platform characterized by a single plasmid DNA with multiple
coding regions. The plasmid vector is designed to express multiple pathogen antigens. It is delivered via a synthetic delivery system
and has the potential to be easily modified to create vaccines against a multitude of infectious diseases, addressing: 

Viral
 Mutations : PLACCINE may offer broad-spectrum and mutational resistance (variants) by targeting multiple antigens on a single
 plasmid vector. 

Durable
 Efficacy : PLACCINE delivers a DNA plasmid-based antigen that could result in durable antigen exposure and a robust vaccine response
 to viral antigens. 

Storage
 Distribution : PLACCINE allows for stability that is compatible with manageable vaccine storage and distribution. 

Simple
 Dosing Administration : PLACCINE is a synthetic delivery system that should require a simple injection that does not require
 viruses or special equipment to deliver its payload. 

26 

On
September 2, 2021, the Company announced results from preclinical in vivo studies showing production of antibodies and cytotoxic
T-cell response specific to the spike antigen of SARS-CoV-2 when immunizing BALB/c mice with the Company s next-generation PLACCINE
DNA vaccine platform. Moreover, the antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen prevented the infection of cultured cells in a viral neutralization
assay. The production of antibodies predicts the ability of PLACCINE to protect against SARS-CoV-2 exposure, and the elicitation of cytotoxic
T-cell response shows the vaccine s potential to eradicate cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. These findings demonstrated the potential
immunogenicity of Imunon s PLACCINE DNA vaccine, which is intended to provide broad-spectrum protection and resistance against
variants by incorporating multiple viral antigens, to improve vaccine stability at storage temperatures of 4 C and above, and to
facilitate cheaper and easier manufacturing. 

On
January 31, 2022, the Company announced the initiation of a nonhuman primate NHP challenge study with Imunon s
DNA-based approach for a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The NHP pilot study followed the generation of encouraging mouse data and will evaluate
the Company s lead vaccine formulations for safety, immunogenicity and protection against SARS-CoV-2. In completed preclinical
studies, Imunon demonstrated a favorable safety profile and efficient immune responses including IgG response, neutralizing antibodies
and T-cell responses that parallel the activity of commercial vaccines following intramuscular (IM) administration of novel vaccine compositions
expressing a single viral antigen. In addition, vector development has shown promise of neutralizing activity against a range of SARS-CoV-2
variants. Imunon s DNA-based vaccines have been based on a simple intramuscular injection that does not require viral encapsulation
or special equipment for administration. 

In
April 2022, the Company presented its PLACCINE platform technology at the 2022 World Vaccine Congress. In an oral presentation during
a Session on Cancer and Immunotherapy, Dr. Khursheed Anwer, the Company s Chief Science Officer, highlighted the Company s
technology platform in his presentation entitled: Novel DNA Approaches for Cancer Immunotherapies and Multivalent Infectious
Disease Vaccines. PLACCINE has demonstrated the potential to be a powerful platform that provides for rapid design capability
for targeting two or more different variants of a single virus in one vaccine. There is a clear public health need for vaccines today
that address more than one strain of viruses, like COVID-19, which have fast evolving variant capability to offer the widest possible
protection. Murine model data has thus far been encouraging and suggests that the Company s approach provides not only flexibility,
but also the potential for efficacy comparable to benchmark COVID-19 commercial vaccines with durability to protect for more than six
months. 

In
September 2022, the Company provided an update on the progress made in the development of a DNA-based vaccine using its PLACCINE platform
technology. The Company reported evidence of IgG, neutralizing antibody, and T-cell responses to its SARS-CoV-2 PLACCINE vaccines in
normal mice. In this murine model, the Company s multivalent PLACCINE vaccine targeted against two different variants showed to
be immunogenic as determined by the levels of IgG, neutralizing antibodies, and T-cell responses. Additionally, our multivalent vaccine
was equally effective against two different variants of the COVID-19 virus while the commercial mRNA vaccine appeared to have lost some
activity against the newer variant. 

Final
data from its now completed proof-of-concept PoC mouse challenge study confirmed that a PLACCINE DNA-based vaccine can
produce robust levels of IgG, neutralizing antibodies, and T-cell responses. The data demonstrated the ability of the Company s
PLACCINE vaccine to protect a SARS-CoV-2 mouse model in a live viral challenge. In the study, mice were vaccinated with a PLACCINE vaccine
expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen from the D614G variant or the Delta variant, or a combination vaccine expressing both the D614G
and Delta spike variants. The vaccination was administered by intramuscular injection on Day 0 and Day 14, followed by challenge with
live SARS-CoV-2 virus on Day 42. All three vaccines, including the single and dual antigen vaccines, were found to have a favorable safety
profile and elicited IgG responses and inhibited the viral load by 90-95 . The dual antigen vaccine was equally effective against both
variants of the SARS CoV-2 virus. 

In
October 2022, the Company reported partial results from an ongoing non-human primate study designed to examine the immunogenicity of
its proprietary PLACCINE vaccine which supported PLACCINE as a viable alternative to mRNA vaccines. The study examined a single plasmid
DNA vector containing the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant spike antigen formulated with a synthetic DNA delivery system and administered by
intramuscular injection. In the study, Cynomolgus monkeys were vaccinated with the PLACCINE vaccine or a commercial mRNA vaccine on Day
1, 28 and 84. Analysis of blood samples for IgG and neutralizing antibodies showed evidence of immunogenicity both in PLACCINE and mRNA
vaccinated subjects. Analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage for viral load by quantitative PCR showed viral clearance by >90 of the non-vaccinated
controls. Viral clearance from nasal swab followed a similar pattern in a majority of vaccinated animals and a similar clearance profile
was observed when viral load was analyzed by the tissue culture infectious dose method. 

27 

In
March 2023, the Company announced final results from the NHP study involving three vaccine-treated non-human primates. The final data
were consistent with the earlier data and showed excellent immunological response and viral clearance. More specifically, in this NHP
study, we examined PLACCINE activity against a more advanced SARS-CoV-2 variants and at a DNA dose that was not previously tested in
NHP and demonstrated robust IgG responses, neutralizing antibody responses and complete clearance of virus following the challenge as
seen in the previous study. 

In
a recent mouse study, a single dose of PLACCINE vaccine without a booster dose produced longer duration of IgG responses and higher T-cell
activation than an mRNA vaccine. A 12-month PLACCINE stability study demonstrated continued drug stability at 4 C (standard refrigerated
temperature). These compelling data were presented at the Vaccine Technology Summit 2023 in Boston in March 2023. They showed robust
immunogenicity and protection in SARS-CoV-2 models, durable cellular or humoral responses detectable for more than 12 months, comparable
protection activity to a commercial mRNA vaccine in a booster-dose comparison and superior immune quality versus the mRNA vaccine in
a single-dose comparison. 

In
March 2023, the Company filed with the FDA a pre-IND package in advance of beginning human testing of a SARS-CoV-2 seasonal booster vaccine.
In July 2023, the FDA confirmed in a written response our plug and play strategy agreeing that a platform approach to pre-clinical toxicology
testing with reference to updated SARS-CoV-2 genes that align with current variant of concern may be used without additional need for
toxicology studies. This demonstrated the flexibility and versatility of our platform, which allows for the rapid production and development
of any vaccine by simply changing the antigen coding cassette. 

On
April 18, 2024, the Company announced that it received clearance from the FDA to begin a Phase I clinical trial with a seasonal COVID-19
booster vaccine. The Company filed an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for IMNN-101 in late February. The primary objectives
of the Phase I study are to evaluate safety, tolerability, neutralizing antibody response, and the vaccine s durability (duration
of immunogenicity) in healthy adults. Secondary objectives of the study include evaluating the ability of the IMNN-101 vaccine to elicit
binding antibodies and cellular responses and their associated durability. The Phase I study enrolled 24 subjects to evaluate three escalating
doses of IMNN-101. For this study, IMMN-101 has been designed to protect against the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron XBB1.5 variant, in accordance
with the FDA s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee s June 2023 announcement of the framework for
updated COVID-19 doses. Based on these results, we will advance discussions with potential partners to continue development of the platform. 

During
the second quarter of 2024, the Company announced that DM Clinical Research in Philadelphia was the first clinical site activated and
ready for patient recruitment for its Phase I study with IMNN-101 in a seasonal COVID-19 vaccine. DM Clinical Research is an integrated
national network of clinical trial sites focused on delivering advanced, preventive medicine to underserved communities. As of September
2024, all 24 Phase I participants were inoculated with IMNN-101 at DM Clinical Research. Topline safety and immunogenicity data
are anticipated by year-end 2024. 

The
Phase I trial is designed to establish PoC for IMNN-101 as an advancement in vaccine technology. At the conclusion of this trial, Imunon
intends to seek partnership and/or business development opportunities to develop future the scientific and business case for IMNN-101
as a future vaccine to address viral mutations. 

Business
Plan and Going Concern Risk 

We
have not generated and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales in the next several years, if at all. An element of our
business strategy has been to pursue, as resources permit, the research and development of a range of drug candidates for a variety of
indications. We may also evaluate licensing products from third parties to expand our current product pipeline. This is intended to allow
us to diversify the risks associated with our research and development expenditures. To the extent we are unable to maintain a broad
range of drug candidates, our dependence on the success of one or a few drug candidates would increase and would have a more significant
impact on our financial prospects, financial condition, and market value. We may also consider and evaluate strategic alternatives, including
investment in, or acquisition of, complementary businesses, technologies, or products. Drug research and development is an inherently
uncertain process and there is a high risk of failure at every stage prior to approval. The timing and the outcome of clinical results
are extremely difficult to predict. The success or failure of any preclinical development and clinical trial can have a disproportionately
positive or negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition, prospects, and market value. 

28 

Our
current business strategy includes the possibility of entering into collaborative arrangements with third parties to complete the development
and commercialization of our drug candidates. In the event that third parties are contracted to manage the clinical trial process for
one or more of our drug candidates, the estimated completion dates of such clinical trials would largely be under the control of that
third party rather than us. We cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which proprietary products or indications, if any, will be
subject to future collaborative arrangements, in whole or in part, and how such arrangements would affect our development plan or capital
requirements. We may also apply for subsidies, grants or government or agency-sponsored studies that could reduce our development costs.
However, we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether we will be selected to receive any subsidy, grant or governmental funding. 

Since
inception, the Company has incurred substantial operating losses, principally from expenses associated with the Company s
research and development programs, clinical trials conducted in connection with the Company s drug candidates, and
applications and submissions to the FDA. The Company has not generated significant revenue and has incurred significant net losses
in each year since our inception. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has incurred approximately 403 million of cumulative net
losses and had 10.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and interest receivable to fund its operations. On
July 30, 2024, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the July 2024 Purchase Agreement with certain
institutional and accredited investors (each, a Purchaser and collectively, the Purchasers ), pursuant to
which we issued, in a registered direct offering, an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock at an
offering price of 2.00 per share for gross proceeds of 10.0 million before the deduction of the placement agent fees and offering
expenses. We have substantial future capital requirements to continue our research and development activities and advance our drug
candidates through various development stages. The Company believes these expenditures are essential for the commercialization of
its drug candidates and technologies. The Company s primary sources of cash have been proceeds from the issuance and sale of
its common stock via its ATM program pursuant to an At the Market Offering Agreement (the ATM Agreement with H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC Wainwright as sales agent and other potential funding transactions. There can be
no assurance that the Company will be able to do so in the future on a timely basis on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all.
The Company has not yet commercialized any of its product candidates. Even if the Company commercializes one or more of its product
candidates, it may not become profitable in the near term. The Company s ability to achieve profitability depends on several
factors, including its ability to obtain regulatory approval for its product candidates, successfully complete any post-approval
regulatory obligations and successfully commercialize its product candidates alone or in partnership. 

Given
our development plans, we anticipate cash resources will not be sufficient to fund the Company s operations for the next twelve
months. The Company has no committed sources of additional capital. As a result of the risks and uncertainties discussed in our most
recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, among others, we are unable to estimate the duration and completion costs of our research and development
projects or when, if ever, and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product. Our inability
to complete any of our research and development activities, preclinical studies or clinical trials in a timely manner or our failure
to enter into collaborative agreements when appropriate could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact
our liquidity. While our estimated future capital requirements are uncertain and could increase or decrease as a result of many factors,
including the extent to which we choose to advance our research, development activities, preclinical studies and clinical trials, or
if we are in a position to pursue manufacturing or commercialization activities, we will need significant additional capital to develop
our drug candidates through development and clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals and manufacture and commercialized approved
products, if any. We do not know whether we will be able to access additional capital when needed or on terms favorable to us or our
stockholders. Our inability to raise additional capital, or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us, would jeopardize the future
success of our business. 

Based
on the above, management has determined there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. The report of
our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes an explanatory paragraph which expresses
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

29 

Management s
plan may include raising funds from outside investors via its ATM program and other potential funding sources as mentioned. However,
as mentioned above, there is no assurance such funding will be available to the Company or that it will be obtained on terms favorable
to the Company or will provide the Company with sufficient funds to meet its objectives. The Company s financial statements do
not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets, carrying amounts or the amount and classification
of liabilities that may be required should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company s ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the
recent disruptions to, and volatility in, financial markets in the U.S., the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the unrest in the Middle
East. These disruptions may also disrupt the clinical trials process and enrollment of patients. This may delay commercialization efforts.
The Company continues to monitor its operating activities in light of these events. 

Financing
Overview 

Equity,
Debt and Other Forms of Financing 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we issued a total of 5.1 million shares and 1.9 million shares of common stock, respectively,
as discussed below for approximately 9.1 million and approximately 2.8 million, respectively, in net proceeds. 

On
May 15, 2024, the Company filed with the SEC a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (the 2024 Registration Statement for the offer and sale of up to 75 million its securities. The 2024 Registration Statement was declared effective on May 22, 2024. The
2024 Registration Statement is intended to provide the Company with flexibility to raise capital in the future for general corporate
purposes. However, the Company s ability to offer and sell its securities in a primary offering on the 2024 Registration Statement
is limited by General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3 (the Baby Shelf Limitation ), which limits the amount that the Company

FINANCIAL
REVIEW FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023 

Results
of Operations 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, our net loss was 4.8 million compared to a net loss of 3.5 million for the same three-month
period of 2023. 

With
 10.3 million in cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024, such conditions raise substantial doubts about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the above, management has determined there is substantial doubt regarding our ability
to continue a going concern. 

On
July 30, 2024, the Company entered into the July 2024 Purchase Agreement with certain institutional and accredited investors, pursuant
to which the Company issued, in a registered direct offering, an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock at
an offering price of 2.00 per share for gross proceeds of 10.0 million before the deduction of placement agent fees and offering expenses.
In a concurrent private placement (together with the registered direct offering) and also pursuant to the July 2024 Purchase Agreement,
the Company issued to the Purchasers unregistered warrants to purchase an aggregate of 5,000,000
shares of common stock at an exercise price of 2.00 per share. The Warrants were exercisable immediately after issuance for a
term of five and one-half years following the date of issuance. The closing of the July 2024 Offering occurred on August 1, 2024. 

31 

Management s
plan may include raising additional funds from the issuance and sale of its common stock via its ATM program and other funding transactions.
However, as mentioned above, there is no assurance such funding will be available to the Company or that it will be obtained on terms
favorable to the Company or will provide the Company with sufficient funds to meet its objectives. The Company s financial statements
do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets, carrying amounts or the amount and classification
of liabilities that may be required should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

period of 2023. Investment income from the Company s short-term investments decreased by 0.3 million for the third quarter of
2024 compared with the same period in 2023 due to a decrease in investment securities. 

FINANCIAL
REVIEW FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023 

Results
of Operations 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 our net loss was 14.6 million. 

With
 10.3 million in cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024, such conditions raise substantial doubts about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the above, management has determined there is substantial doubt regarding our ability
to continue a going concern.

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses were 5.6 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 7.3 million in the same period of 2023. The
decrease was primarily attributable to lower non-cash stock compensation expenses of 0.3 million, legal expenses of 0.6 million, employee-related
expenses of 0.5 million and insurance expenses of 0.1 million. 

33 

Other
non-operating income was 0.4 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023. The Company incurred interest expense of 0.2 million
on its loan facility with Silicon Valley Bank in the first nine months of 2023. This loan facility was repaid in full in the second quarter
of 2023. Investment income from the Company s short-term investments decreased by 0.5 million for the first nine months of 2024
compared with the same period in 2023 due to a decrease in investment securities. The Company incurred debt extinguishment expense on
its loan facility with Silicon Valley Bank in the first nine months of 2023 of 0.3 million. 

FINANCIAL
CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Since
inception we have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations. We have financed our operations primarily through
the net proceeds from the sales of equity, credit facilities, the sale of the Company s net operating losses, and amounts received
under various product licensing agreements. The process of developing IMNN-001 and other drug candidates and technologies requires significant
research and development work and clinical trial studies, as well as significant manufacturing and process development efforts. We expect
these activities, together with our general and administrative expenses to result in significant operating losses for the foreseeable
future. Our expenses have significantly and regularly exceeded our revenue, and we had an accumulated deficit of 403 million at September
30, 2024. 

At
September 30, 2024, we had total current assets of 12.5 million and current liabilities of 5.4 million, resulting in net working capital
of 7.1 million. At September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 10.3 million. At December 31, 2023, we had total current
assets of 18.2 million and current liabilities of 7.4 million, resulting in net working capital of 10.8 million. We require substantial
future capital to continue our research and development activities and advance our drug candidates through various development stages.
The Company believes these expenditures are essential for the commercialization of its technologies. 

Net
cash used in operating activities for the first nine months of 2024 was 14.4 million. Net cash provided by investing activities was
 9.8 million during the first nine months of 2024. Cash provided by financing activities during the first nine months of 2024 was
 9.1 million. At September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 10.3 million. 

On
July 30, 2024, we entered into the July 2024 Purchase Agreement with certain institutional and accredited investors, pursuant to which
we issued, in a registered direct offering an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of our common stock at an offering price of 2.00 per share
for gross proceeds of 10.0 million before the deduction of placement agent fees and offering expenses. In a concurrent private placement
(together with the registered direct offering) and also pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, we issued to the Purchasers unregistered
warrants to purchase an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price
of 2.00 per share. The Warrants were exercisable immediately after issuance for a term of five and one-half years following the date
of issuance. The closing of the July 2024 Offering occurred on August 1, 2024. 

We
expect to seek additional capital through further public or private equity offerings, debt financing, additional strategic alliance and
licensing arrangements, collaborative arrangements, potential sales of our net operating losses, or some combination of these financing
alternatives. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders could
be significantly diluted, and the newly issued equity securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of the holders
of our common stock. If we raise funds through the issuance of debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences, and privileges
senior to those of our common stock. If we seek strategic alliances, licenses, or other alternative arrangements, such as arrangements
with collaborative partners or others, we may need to relinquish rights to certain of our existing or future technologies, product candidates,
or products we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on our own, or to license the rights to our technologies, product candidates,
or products on terms that are not favorable to us. The overall status of the economic climate could also result in the terms of any equity
offering, debt financing, or alliance, license, or other arrangement being even less favorable to us and our stockholders than if the
overall economic climate were stronger. We also will continue to look for government sponsored research collaborations and grants to
help offset future anticipated losses from operations and, to a lesser extent, interest income. 

34 

If
adequate funds are not available through either the capital markets, strategic alliances, collaborators, or sales of our net operating
losses, we may be required to delay or, reduce the scope of, or terminate our research, development, clinical programs, manufacturing,
or commercialization efforts, or effect additional changes to our facilities or personnel, or obtain funds through other arrangements
that may require us to relinquish some of our assets or rights to certain of our existing or future technologies, product candidates,
or products on terms not favorable to us. 

Such
conditions raise substantial doubts about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plan includes
raising funds from the issuance and sale of its common stock via its ATM program and other funding transactions. However, as mentioned
above, there is no assurance such funding will be available to the Company or that it will be obtained on terms favorable to the Company
or will provide the Company with sufficient funds to meet its objectives. The Company s financial statements do not include any
adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets, carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities
that may be required should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required
under this item. 

Item
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

We
have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as that
term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, which is the end of the period covered by this
report, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level in alerting them in a timely manner to
material information required to be included in our periodic reports with the SEC. 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation that occurred during the
period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting. 

Our
management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures
or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the
inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances
of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making
can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the
individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control. The design of any system
of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that
any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent
limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 

On
July 30, 2024, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement with certain institutional
and accredited investors (each, a Purchaser and collectively, the Purchasers for a registered direct offering
of its common stock, par value 0.01 per share Common Stock ). In a concurrent private placement (together with the registered
direct offering, the Offering and also pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company issued to the Purchasers unregistered
warrants (the Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of Common Stock
 at an exercise price of 2.00 per share. The Warrants were exercisable immediately for a term of five and one-half years following
the date of issuance. The Company received gross proceeds of 10.0 million from the Offering, before deducting placement agent fees and
other offering expenses payable by the Company. As of September 30, 2024, no Warrants have been exercised. 

H.C.
Wainwright Co., LLC acted as the lead placement agent for the Offering. Brookline Capital Markets, a division of Arcadia Securities,
LLC, acted as co-placement agent. The Offering closed on August 1, 2024. The Company plans to use the proceeds from the Offering for
working capital and general corporate purposes. The Warrants were not and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the Securities Act in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities
Act and/or Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated thereunder, or under any state securities laws. The Company relied on this exemption
from registration based in part on representations made by the Purchasers. The Warrants may not be offered or sold in the United States
absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. 

On
August 29, 2024, the Company filed with the SEC a resale registration statement on Form S-1 to
register the shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants, which resale registration statement was declared effective
