 On May 5, 2023, the Company received a letter from the Nasdaq Capital Market (Nasdaq) notifying the Company that for the prior 30 consecutive business days the bid price for the Company's common stock had closed below the minimum per share requirement for continued inclusion on Nasdaq pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550 (a)( 2 (Bid Price Rule). The deficiency letter did not result in the immediate delisting of the Company's common stock from the Nasdaq. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810 (c)( 3 )(A), the Company was provided an initial period of 180 calendar days, until November 1, 2023, to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule. On November 2, 2023, the Company received a -calendar day extension, until April 29, 2024, from the Nasdaq to regain compliance with Bid Price Rule. On March 5, 2024, the Board of Directors approved a reverse 1 -for- reverse stock split effective 11:59 P.M. (Eastern time) on March 21, 2024, with trading to commence on a split-adjusted basis on March 22, 2024. On April 8, 2024, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it had regained compliance with Bid Price Rule 5550 (a)( 2 as a result of the closing bid price of the Company's common stock being at per share or greater for the 10 consecutive business days from March 22, 2024 through April 5, 2024. Accordingly, the Company is in compliance with the Bid Price Rule and Nasdaq considers the matter closed. 

. The accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements gives retroactive effect to the reverse stock split for all periods presented. Certain amounts previously reported include rounding up of fractional shares as a result of the reverse stock split. 

million since inception and had not yet generated any revenues from operations. Additionally, management anticipates that its cash on hand of million a s of September 30, 2024 is not sufficient to fund its planned operations for a period of at least one year from when these consolidated financial statements are issued. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company intends to seek additional funding through one or more of the following: a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, government or other third -party funding, commercialization, marketing and distribution arrangements, other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements and delay planned cash outlays or a combination thereof. There can be no assurance that such events or a combination thereof can be achieved. 
 
 In March 2022, the Company received a subpoena from the SEC requesting information and documents, including materials related to certain individuals none of which are the Company's officers or directors) and entities, and materials related to the development of and statements regarding the Company's drug candidate for the treatment of COVID- 19. The Company has received, and expects to continue to receive, periodic further requests from the SEC staff with respect to this matter. The Company is not aware of the specific nature of the underlying investigation by the SEC, and to the extent that this investigation relates to prior public disclosures that it has made, the Company believes in the accuracy and adequacy of such prior disclosures. The correspondence from the SEC transmitting the subpoena to the Company states that the SEC is trying to determine whether there have been any violations of federal securities laws, but that its investigation does not mean that the SEC has concluded that anyone has violated the law or that the SEC has a negative opinion of any person, entity, or security. The Company cannot predict when this matter will be resolved or what, if any, action the SEC may take following the conclusion of the investigation. The company expensed approximately million and million in related general and administrative fees and expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and million and milli on for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively . The Company is in the process of filing a claim with its insurance carriers related to this loss which may cover a portion of the related expenses but not all. The claim is currently under review by the insurance company. The claim has not yet been approved nor has a reimbursement amount been determined which, if any, would be limited by the applicable retention as defined under the policy . Accordingly, the Company has not recorded any provision for insurance reimbursement. The Company expects to record the insurance reimbursement at the time that the amount to be reimbursed is determined and approved by the insurance carrier. Any insurance reimbursement receivable will be recorded at an amount not to exceed the recorded loss and only if the terms of the legally enforceable insurance contracts support that the insurance recovery will not be disputed and is deemed collectible, or if recovery of the loss is probable. 

The Company s financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include the fair value of warrant liability discussed in Note 4. 
 
 The following table provides the financial liabilities reported at fair value and measured on a recurring basis at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (table in thousands):

shares of common stock, and pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of common stock, series A warrants to purchase up to shares of common stock, series B warrants to purchase up to shares of common stock, and placement agent warrants. The combined purchase price for the securities was per share of common stock (or pre-funded warrant in lieu thereof). Each pre-funded warrant is exercisable for one share of common stock at an exercise price of per share. The pre-funded warrants are exercisable immediately and may be exercised at any time until all of the pre-funded warrants are exercised in full, subject to the beneficial ownership limitation. Each common warrant has an exercise price of per share and will be exercisable beginning on the effective date of shareholder approval. The series A warrants expire on the earlier of (i) two years from the initial exercise date, or (ii) 60 days from the Company's public announcement that it has achieved the series A milestone event. The series B warrants expire on the earlier of (i) five years from the initial exercise date, or (ii) six months from the Company's public announcement that it has achieved the series B milestone event. The series A milestone event means the Company releases interim data for the first subject group from the MIRACLE trial whereby the complete remission rate for either dose of the Company's study drug is greater than placebo; and series B milestone event means the Company releases final topline data from the MIRACLE trial and documented a statistically significant improvement in the primary efficacy endpoint. In addition, in August 2024, the Company entered into a warrant amendment agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed that effective upon closing of the offering, and subject to shareholder approval, to amend existing warrants originally issued on December 26, 2023 at an exercise price of per share and a termination date of February 14, 2029, so that the amended warrants would have a reduced exercise price of per share and would expire five years from the date of shareholder approval. The Company calculated the valuation of the warrant amendment immediately prior to the offering, as well as the valuation of the warrant amendment with the repriced terms, and a 50 probability of obtaining shareholder approval. The loss on modification of the warrants of 0.4 million was recorded as a loss on issuance of warrant liabilities in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company also considered a 50 probability of obtaining shareholder approval in the valuation for the August 2024 warrants in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. In October 2024, the Company s shareholders approved the issuance of both the August 2024 warrants, as well as the warrant amendment. 
 
 The Company received gross proceeds of million, before deducting the placement agent's fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company. Proceeds of offerings are allocated between common shares and warrants first by allocating to the warrants classified as a liability based on their fair value and then allocating the residual to the equity instruments, which would include pre-funded warrants. As the fair value of the liability classified warrants in the August 2024 offering exceeded the total proceeds, no consideration was allocated to the Common Shares or Pre-Funded Warrants. The full proceeds of the August 2024 offering were recorded to warrant liabilities, with an initial liability of million, and a loss on initial recognition of million. Transaction costs related to the offering were correspondingly fully allocated to warrant liabilities, and million in related transaction costs were expensed during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 
 Lincoln Park Equity Line 
 
 The Company did not utilize the 2021 Lincoln Park purchase agreement during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . The 2021 Lincoln Park Agreement terminated in June 2024. 
 
 Other Components of Equity 
 
 In March 2024, the Company issued shares of common stock to consultants in exchange for services to be provided. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company issued shares of common stock related to the vesting of restricted stock units. 
 
 Liability Classified Warrants 
 
 The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model (BSM) to determine the fair value of its warrants at the date of issue and outstanding at each reporting date. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates on zero coupon U.S. Treasury bonds linearly interpolated to obtain a maturity period commensurate with the term of the warrants. Estimated volatility is a measure of the amount by which the Company's stock price is expected to fluctuate each year during the expected life of the warrants. Only the volatility of the Company's own stock is used in the Black-Scholes option pricing mode l. Certain assumptions, including the expected term, are subjective and require judgment to develop. As a result, if factors or expected outcomes change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our warrant liability could be materially different. 
 
 The assumptions used in determining the fair value of the Company's outstanding liability classified warrants are as follows: 
 
 to to 
 Volatility to to 
 Expected life (years) to to 
 Dividend yield

 Equity Classified Warrants 
 
 In March 2024, the Company granted equity-classified warrants to purchase up to shares of Company common stock with a ten -year term and an exercise price of . The warrants vest annually over four years while services are being performed. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 , the Company had equity classified warrants outstanding (including the remaining August 2024 pre-funded warrants) an d w arrants were exercisable. At December 31, 2023 , the Company had equity classified warrants outstanding and warrants were exercisable.

In October 2024, the Company's shareholders approved the 2024 Stock Plan, which authorizes a total of shares of common stock, which will replace the 2015 Stock Plan. 
 
 Stock-based compensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, is as follows (table in thousands): 

Research and development 
 Total stock-based compensation expense 

The Company recorded stock compensation expense for the equity classified warrants relating to non-employee consulting agreements o f a nd for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and a nd for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, which are included in the table above. At September 30, 2024 , there was of unrecognized stock compensation expense related to the Company's equity classified warrants. 
 
 In October and November 2024, the Company granted stock options, shares of restricted stock units, shares of performance based restricted stock units, and in warrants to employees and contractors. These stock options have an exercise price ranging from to and vest over a one -to- four year period from the grant date on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The restricted stock units vest annually in four equal installments. 

income tax provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is nil. The income tax rates vary from the federal and state statutory rates primarily due to the change in fair value of the stock warrants, Internal Revenue Code Section 162 (m) limitations and ISO activity, as well as the valuation allowances on the Company s deferred tax assets. The Company estimates its annual effective tax rate at the end of each quarterly period. Jurisdictions with a projected loss for the year where no tax benefit can be recognized due to the valuation allowance could result in a higher or lower effective tax rate during a particular quarter depending on the mix and timing of actual earnings versus annual projections. 

Lease Obligations Payable

 Our Business 
 
 We are a Phase 3 clinical stage pharmaceutical company with a portfolio of technologies for hard-to-treat cancers and viruses. We have three core technologies, each of which have had one or more drugs successfully complete a Phase 1 clinical trial, based substantially on discoveries made at and licensed from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD Anderson) in Houston, Texas. Three of our six drug candidates have shown human activity in clinical trials and are currently or have been in Phase 1B/2 or Phase 2 clinical trials. Since our inception, our drugs have completed, are currently in, or have been permitted to proceed in, fourteen clinical trials. Annamycin is our lead molecule and we have recently concluded one Phase 1B/2 clinical trial for treating Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and are embarking on a Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of AML, which we believe will be pivotal. Annamycin is also in two Phase 1B/2 clinical trials for treating Soft Tissue Sarcoma metastasized to the lungs (STS lung metastases, STS lung mets, or Advanced STS). 
 
 One of our core management beliefs is that anthracyclines represent the most important treatment for AML and Advanced STS, and we believe Annamycin may, for the first time ever, allow a majority of these patients to benefit from this treatment, mainly due to its lack of cardiotoxicity (which is found in currently prescribed anthracyclines) and its ability to avoid multidrug resistance mechanisms. This belief, coupled with our limited resources, leads us to currently focus mainly on the development of Annamycin. We intend to advance our other drug candidates via investigator led studies both clinically and preclinically. 
 
 Our Core Technologies 
 
 Our core technologies consist of the following programs: 
 
 a) Annamycin or L-Annamycin is a next generation anthracycline (one of the most widely used classes of chemotherapy), designed to be different than currently approved anthracyclines, which are limited in utility because of cardiotoxicity risks and their susceptibility to multidrug resistance mechanisms. Annamycin was designed to avoid multidrug resistance and to be non-cardiotoxic and, with intensive cardiac monitoring, has shown no cardiotoxicity in subjects treated in our four Annamycin clinical trials to date. Furthermore, we have demonstrated safe dosing significantly beyond the dose limitations imposed by regulatory authorities upon commonly prescribed anthracyclines due to their inherent cardiotoxicity. Annamycin has demonstrated efficacy in two of its Phase 1B/2 trials in subjects with AML and Advanced STS. We believe that Annamycin has potential to fill an unmet need as a second line therapy (2nd line or 2L) in AML and potentially as first line therapy in Advanced STS.

Table of Contents 

As part of our Annamycin clinical trials, we have engaged an independent expert to assess cardiotoxicity associated with chemotherapy at the Cleveland Clinic (Expert or Independent Expert). The data made available to the Expert include left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) as determined by echocardiograms, and ECHO strain imaging, as well as serum Troponin levels (a biochemical marker of acute heart damage). ECHO strain imaging is a method in echocardiography (medical ultrasound) for measuring regional or global deformation (contraction or beating) of the myocardium (heart muscle). By strain rate imaging, the simultaneous function of different regions can be displayed and measured. Cardiac health biomarkers such as blood Troponin levels are considered an indicator of potential long-term heart damage. The Expert has issued and will continue to issue periodic reports as additional data are provided to him in batches of subject data. Such data include some data which are preliminary and subject to change. In our discussions regarding the lack of Annamycin's cardiotoxicity, we rely on the Expert's assessment. 
 
 Annamycin benefits from a promising advancement in lipid enabled drug delivery developed in collaboration with and exclusively licensed from MD Anderson. The unique patented lipid composition allows us to combine a new concept in chemotherapeutic agents within a lipid structure that helps target the delivery of the payload and reduce the potential for toxicity. In the case of Annamycin, our unique use of lipid technology enables improved tissue/organ distribution, and as demonstrated in multiple clinical trials, dramatically reduced toxicity, including cardiotoxicity. Annamycin has composition of matter patent protection through 2040. 
 
 b) Our WP1066 Portfolio includes WP1066, WP1193 and WP1220, three of several Immune/Transcription Modulators in the portfolio designed to inhibit p-STAT3 (phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription) among other transcription factors associated with tumor activity. These also stimulate a natural immune response to tumors by inhibiting the errant activity of Regulatory T-Cells (TRegs). WP1066, in oral formulation, has been in two clinical trials for central nervous system (CNS) tumors, including compassionate use cases, in pediatric subjects. WP1066 and WP1193 are being tested in preclinical programs in intravenous (IV) formulations. WP1066 and WP1220 have been in clinical trials in a topical formulation. WP1066 and WP1220 have both independently successfully completed Phase 1 clinical trials and have demonstrated efficacy in their varied indications. 
 
 c) Our WP1122 Portfolio contains compounds (including WP1122, WP1096, and WP1097) designed to exploit the potential uses of inhibitors of glycolysis such as 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG). We believe such compounds may provide an opportunity to cut off the energy supply of tumors by taking advantage of their high degree of dependence on glucose in comparison to healthy cells, as well as viruses that also depend upon glycolysis and glycosylation to infect and replicate. WP1122 has completed a Phase 1 clinical study in normal volunteers, successfully establishing a Recommended Phase 2 Dose or RP2D. 
 
 Recent Business Developments 
 
 Below are recent business developments. 
 
 Annamycin 
 
 Phase 3 MIRACLE Trial 
 
 We are in the process of evaluating and visiting potential sites for our Phase 3 pivotal trial for the treatment of AML patients who are refractory to or relapsed after induction therapy (R/R AML) with Annamycin in combination with Cytarabine (also known as Ara-C and for which the combination of Annamycin and Ara-C is referred to as AnnAraC ). This Phase 3 MIRACLE trial (derived from (M)olecul(i)n (R)/(r) AML (A)nnAraC (Cl)inical (E)valuation) will be a global trial. 
 
 We plan to focus on sites in the North America, Europe, Eastern Europe, Western Asia, and MENA (Middle East and Africa) for the initial Part A of MIRACLE. Our initial target will be approximate ly 45 sit es. We expect that this will enable the enrollment of approximately 45 subjects by the third quarter of 2025 and approximately 90 subjects by the second half of 2026. The data may also be unblinded after the initial 45 subjects and, as currently planned, the data will be unblinded after approximately 90 subjects complete their efficacy analyses. We believe that we will have the data for approximately the first 90 subjects by the second half of 2026. The trial is designed to enable the review of interim analyses for safety and efficacy upon reaching these enrollment milestones. 
 
 We held a conference call on August 6, 2024, along with Dr. Michael Andreeff, a member of our Science Advisory Board, to discuss the results of our most recent meeting with the FDA and the plans for the MIRACLE trial. That meeting, the MIRACLE trial and the current data from the MB-106 trial are discussed further below. 
 
 On August 1, 2024, we announced the discussion in and our resulting plans from our End of Phase 1B/2 (EOP1B/2) meeting held in late June with the FDA supporting the advancement of Annamycin in combination with Cytarabine (AnnAraC to a Phase 3 pivotal trial for the treatment of AML patients who are refractory to or relapsed after induction therapy (R/R AML). This Phase 3 MIRACLE trial will be a global study, including sites in the US and consistent with the FDA s recommendations, the adaptive Phase 3 trial is expected to rely solely on CR (complete remission) at day 35 (+/- 14 days) as the primary endpoint versus the control arm. We plan to utilize a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, where the control arm is high dose cytarabine (HiDAC) plus placebo. The MIRACLE trial will focus on AnnAraC as a 2 nd line treatment for R/R AML subjects, with a subsequent trial to be focused on AnnAraC as a 3 rd line treatment for R/R AML. 
 
 Based on our discussions with the FDA, we intend to amend our current investigational new drug application or IND to allow dosing above the lifetime maximum allowable dose (LTMAD) for currently prescribed anthracyclines in this trial in the US. The MIRACLE study, subject to appropriate future filings with and potential additional feedback from the FDA, their foreign equivalents and/or institutional review boards (IRBs), is expected to initially utilize an adaptive design whereby the first 90 subjects will be randomized to receive HiDAC combined with either placebo, 190 mg/m 2 of Annamycin, or 230 mg/m 2 of Annamycin with such doses recommended by the FDA based on their review of our safety and efficacy data. At that point, the trial data will be unblinded to select the optimum dose for Annamycin. For the second half of the trial, approximately 240 subjects will be randomized to receive either HiDAC plus placebo or HiDAC plus the optimum dose of Annamycin. The selection of the optimum dose by the independent Data Monitoring Committee will be based on the overall balance of efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics, consistent with the FDA s new Project Optimus initiative.

We believe the FDA wants to see the durability of response (DoR) and overall survival (OS) as secondary endpoints. In addition, we believe the FDA wants to see data for subjects beyond 2 nd line and, accordingly, our plan includes a follow-on MIRACLE2 trial in 3 rd line subjects starting once the optimum dose is established in the MIRACLE trial. 
 
 We have established plans for the following milestones with regard to the MIRACLE trial: 

2024 2H Begin contracting with MIRACLE trial sites 

2025 Q1 First subject treated in MIRACLE trial 

2025 Q4 Recruitment and interim data (n=~45) 

2H 2026 Interim efficacy and safety data (n=~90) unblinded and Optimum Dose set for MIRACLE trial 

2027 Begin enrollment of 3 rd line subjects in MIRACLE2 

2027 Enrollment ends in 2 nd line subjects 

2028 Primary endpoint efficacy data for 2 nd line subjects in MIRACLE 

2028 2H Begin submission of a new drug application (NDA) the treatment of R/R AML for accelerated approval on primary endpoint of CR from MIRACLE

See Note 1 below 

Note 1 for Table 1: Data from MB-106 is for Intent To Treat (ITT) subjects; is as of October 24, 2024; and, is preliminary and subject to change. Median Durability of all CRc's is ~8 months and climbing. 
 
 On May 7, 2024, our management held a Key Opinion Leader conference call with Dr. Martin Tallman and Dr. Michael Andreeff. Management made a presentation of the data above and discussion ensued with Drs Tallman and Andreeff on the significance of this data. Both Drs. Tallman and Andreeff are members of our Science Advisory Board. 
 
 The call included a discussion of the results to date for MB-106. We believe that the Phase 1B/2 trial has been successful in establishing safety and efficacy of Annamycin in combination with Cytarabine (AnnAraC) for the treatment of AML, and in providing sufficient data to support a Phase 3 registration-directed clinical trial (MB-108) to further provide data for efficacy which we intend to use to support an eventual application for New Drug Approval (NDA). 
 
 Preliminary Safety, Efficacy and Durability Data 
 
 The preliminary data for MB-106 demonstrate a CR rate of 36 and a CRc rate of 41 for all subjects (N=22), regardless of the number of prior treatments, up to 6 prior treatments. Segmenting the MB-106 subject population for 2 nd line subjects (N=10) yields a CR rate of 50 and CRc rate of 60 . Further segmenting for 2 nd and 3 rd line subjects (N=14) yields a CR rate of 43 and a CRc rate of 50 . We believe the results demonstrated by AnnAraC in 2 nd line subjects substantially exceeds the performance reported by any drug currently approved for use in 2 nd line AML. 
 
 Median durability of remission (DoR) for the 9 CRcs is approximately 8 months and developing. The DoR is being measured from the initiation of treatment to relapse or death. 
 
 Cardiovascular safety of Annamycin is thoroughly monitored as independent assessments are made by an independent expert cardio-oncologist from Cleveland Clinic. As of April 1, 2024, data from 84 subjects across five trials (AML STS, internal and externally funded trials) have been reviewed. Of note, most of these subjects have received greater than the lifetime cumulative anthracycline dose above 550 mg/m2 associated with increased risk of cardiomyopathy. Some subjects have received four times this amount following Annamycin administration(s). No signal of cardiotoxicity has been identified. 
 
 Annamycin as Monotherapy for the Treatment of Soft Tissue Sarcoma Lung Metastases 
 
 Additionally, we expect to release in the near future the topline data from the MB-107 trial with Annamycin for the monotherapy treatment of soft tissue sarcoma lung metastases. This Phase 1B/2 clinical trial in the US is for subjects with STS lung metastases after first-line therapy for their disease. The trial began in the first half of 2021. The Phase 1B was concluded in July 2022. On September 21, 2023, we announced the completion of enrollment in the Phase 2 portion of our U.S. Phase 1B/2 clinical trial evaluating Annamycin as monotherapy for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma lung metastases. Subjects who had stable disease at the time of study discontinuation will continue to be followed for progression free response and overall survival. The study database is locked and the clinical study report is being written and should be completed in early 2025 and will be released in detail at that time. The total number of intent to treat subjects in the trial is 36.

U.S Patents for Annamycin 
 
 On April 9, 2024, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) issued U.S. Patent number 11,951,118 titled, Preparation of Preliposomal Annamycin Lyophilizate (the 118 patent to Moleculin and The University of Texas System Board of Regents. Additionally on May 14, 2024, the USPTO issued an additional patent (U.S. Patent number 11,980,634) titled Method of Reconstituting Liposomal Annamycin (the 634 patent ). We have global, exclusive licenses to both patents. 
 
 The 118 patent provides claims to compositions that contain Annamycin, and the 634 patent, as issued, provides claims to liposomal Annamycin suspension compositions, both with a base patent term extending until June 2040, subject to extension to account for time required to fulfill regulatory requirements for FDA approval. Moleculin s novel candidate for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and soft tissue sarcoma lung metastases (STS lung mets) uses a unique lipid-based delivery technology. In addition to the issued 118 and expected 634 U.S. patents, we have additional patent applications pending in major jurisdictions worldwide. 
 
 EMA issues ODD to Annamycin for the treatment of AML 
 
 We announced that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) to Annamycin for the treatment of AML. Combined with the Orphan Drug Designation we have in the US and with the new composition of matter and formulation patents just awarded by the US Patent and Trademark Office with coverage through 2040, we believe the commercial exclusivity of Annamycin is now well protected. 
 
 The EMA grants orphan drug designation to drugs and biologics intended for the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare, life-threatening or chronically debilitating diseases or conditions that affect fewer than five in 10,000 people in the European Union. Orphan designation potentially allows companies certain benefits, including reduced regulatory fees, clinical protocol assistance, research grants and up to 10 years of potential market exclusivity in the European Union if approved. 
 
 Presentation at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer 2024 World Conference on Lung Cancer 
 
 On September 23, 2024, we announced positive in vivo efficacy data of Annamycin in orthotopic and experimental lung metastatic models of sarcoma at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) 2024 World Conference on Lung Cancer. Treatment with Annamycin resulted in statistically significant inhibition of tumor growth and extension of survival in orthotopic lung cancer models and continues to be 100 non-cardiotoxic. The poster titled Annamycin: Opening New Doors for Organotropic Targeting of Primary and Metastatic Lung Cancer , authored by Waldemar Priebe, PhD (Founder, Founding Scientist, and Chair of Scientific Advisory Board for Moleculin) and coworkers was presented at the IASLC 2024 World Conference on Lung Cancer. The presented poster outlined results from the efficacy assessment studies of Annamycin, Moleculin s next-generation anthracycline in orthotopic models of lung cancer and sarcoma lung metastasis models in comparison with doxorubicin (a commonly prescribed anthracycline. 
 
 Key Highlights of the Data Presented: 

Annamycin demonstrated high uptake and retention in lung parenchyma of mice and rats. 

The therapeutic effects of doxorubicin (DOX) are diminished due to low lung DOX uptake as demonstrated in the tested in vivo models. In contrast, Annamycin exhibits consistent efficacy in vivo in orthotopic and experimental lung metastatic models of sarcoma, breast, and colon cancer. This correlated with high Annamycin concentration in lungs, which exceeded DOX levels by 10- to 30-fold. 

Preclinical tests clearly demonstrate a better cardiac safety profile of Annamycin when compared to DOX and no cardiotoxicity of Annamycin in the in vivo models. No cardiotoxicity of Annamycin has been noted in ongoing clinical studies. 

The observed organotropic properties of Annamycin, its efficacy in vivo , and its promising safety profile warrant further translational studies to evaluate Annamycin in patients with primary or metastatic lung cancers, as a single agent and in combination with currently used therapeutics. 

AACR Presentation of Data Demonstrating High Anti-Cancer Activity of Annamycin and Non-Cardiotoxic Properties 
 
 Preclinical data regarding the Company s next-generation anthracycline, Annamycin, was presented at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting, which took place April 5-10, 2024 in San Diego, CA. The poster titled, Non-cardiotoxic Properties of Annamycin, a Clinically Evaluated Anthracycline and Potent Topoisomerase 2 Poison, was presented in the Late-Breaking Research: Experimental and Molecular Therapeutics 2 session held on Monday, April 8 th . The presented poster outlined results from the assessment and comparison of the potency of doxorubicin (a commonly prescribed anthracycline) and Annamycin, Moleculin s next-generation anthracycline, against topoisomerase II-alpha and II-beta and determine their impact on physiology of human cardiomyocytes demonstrating no pathologic changes in mice hearts following chronic in vivo exposure. 
 
 WP1066 
 
 We announced on September 9, 2024, the beginning of enrollment and treatment of patients in an investigator-initiated Phase 2 study evaluating WP1066 in combination with radiation therapy for the treatment of adults with glioblastoma (NU 21C06). The study is being conducted under Northwestern University s investigative New Drug application (IND) which cross references our own IND, which received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April 2022. This trial is funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and BrainUp , a non-profit organization dedicated to bringing awareness to brain cancer. The NU 21C06 trial is a Phase 2, open-label, multi-arm trial of radiation therapy in combination with WP1066 in newly diagnosed IDH (isocitrate dehydrogenase) wild-type, MGMT-unmethylated glioblastoma patients. The primary outcome measure for the study is progression-free survival and secondary outcome measures include tumor microenvironment analysis. Four subjects have been treated as of November 1, 2024. 
 
 Regarding an intravenous formula for WP1066, we are pursuing a new patent that is co-owned by us and MD Anderson. We are in discussions regarding licensing or an option to license the MD Anderson rights to the new formulation.

 We announced on November 4, 2024, the appointment of Daniel D. Von Hoff, M.D., F.A.C.P., FASCO, FAACR to our Annamycin Scientific Advisory Board. Dr. Von Hoff currently serves as the Distinguished Professor at the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen) in Phoenix, Arizona and City of Hope. 
 
 August Issuance of Equity 
 
 On August 19, 2024, we announced the closing of our previously announced public offering of 283,000 shares of common stock and 2,183,368 pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of common stock, Series A warrants to purchase up to 2,466,368 shares of common stock and Series B warrants to purchase up to 2,466,368 shares of common stock, at a combined public offering price of 2.23 per share (or per common stock equivalent in lieu thereof) and accompanying warrants. The Series A warrants have an exercise price of 2.23, are exercisable immediately upon shareholder approval (which was received in October 2024) and will expire upon the earlier of (i) the 2 year anniversary of the date of stockholder approval or (ii) the 60 th day following the date we release interim data for the first subject group from the MIRACLE trial whereby the complete remission rate for either doses of the Company s study drug is greater than placebo. The Series B warrants have an exercise price of 2.23, are exercisable immediately upon shareholder approval (which was received in October 2024) and will expire upon the earlier of (i) the 5 year anniversary of the date of stockholder approval or (ii) the 6 month anniversary following the date we release final topline data from the MIRACLE trial and documented a statistically significant improvement in the primary efficacy endpoint. Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d), the exercise of the Series A warrants and Series B warrants were subject to shareholder approval, which was received. 
 
 The gross proceeds from the offering, before deducting the placement agent s fees and other offering expenses payable by us, were approximately 5.5 million and we would receive up to an additional approximately 11.0 million in gross proceeds if the warrants are fully exercised for cash. We are using the net proceeds from this offering to advance Annamycin and our other two drug portfolios through clinical development, advance the remainder of our existing portfolio through preclinical studies and into INDs or their equivalent, sponsor research at MD Anderson and HPI, and for working capital.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Research and Development Expense. Research and development (R D) expense was 4.9 million and 3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. The increase of 1.6 million is mainly related t o costs incurred for clinical trials (clinical research organization and drug production) and sponsored research costs. 
 
 General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative e xpense was 2.2 million and 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. The decrease of 0.4 million is mainly related to a decrease in regulatory and legal fees. 
 
 (Loss) Gain from Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability. We recorded a net loss of 1.7 million in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to a net gain of 0.001 million in the third quarter of 2023, for the change in fair value on revaluation of our warrant liability associated with our warrants issued in conjunction with certain of our previous stock offerings. We are required to revalue our liability-classified warrants at the time of each warrant exercise, if applicable, and at the end of each reporting period and reflect in the statement of operations a gain or loss from the change in fair value of the warrant in the period in which the change occurred. We calculated the fair value of the warrants outstanding using the Black-Scholes model. A gain results principally from a decline in our share price during the period and a loss results principally from an increase in our share price. 
 
 Transaction costs allocated to warrant liabilities and Loss on issuance of warrant liabilities. Proceeds of offerings are allocated between common shares and warrants first by allocating to the warrants classified as a liability based on their fair value and then allocating the residual to the equity instruments, which would include pre-funded warrants. As the fair value of the liability classified warrants in the August 2024 offering exceeded the total proceeds, no consideration was allocated to the Common Shares or Pre-Funded Warrants. The full proceeds of the August 2024 offering were recorded to warrant liabilities, with an initial liability of 6.1 million, and a loss on initial recognition of 0.8 million. The loss on modification of certain warrants of 0.4 million was also recorded as a loss on issuance of warrant liabilities in the three months ended September 30, 2024. Transaction costs related to the offering were correspondingly fully allocated to warrant liabilities, and 1.0 million in related transaction costs were expensed during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Interest income, net. Interest income, ne t decreased by approximately 0.2 million f or the comparable quarterly periods due to a decreasing cash balance and decreasing interest rates during the past year. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Research and Development Expense. Research and development (R D) expense was 13.3 million and 12.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. The increase of 0.4 million is mainly related to costs incurred for clinical trials (clinical research organization and drug production) and sponsored research costs. These increases were offset by a 1.5 million decrease mainly related to the WPD sublicense termination in 2023, which enabled the reacquisition of our intellectual property rights in certain territories including parts of the European Union. 
 
 General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative e xpense was 6.6 million and 7.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. The decrease of 1.2 million is mainly related to a decrease in regulatory and legal fees. 
 
 Gain from Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability. We recorded a net gain of 1.4 million in the nine months ended 2024 as compared to a net gain of 0.1 million in the nine months ended 2023, for the change in fair value on revaluation of our warrant liability associated with our warrants issued in conjunction with certain of our previous stock offerings. We are required to revalue our liability-classified warrants at the time of each warrant exercise, if applicable, and at the end of each reporting period and reflect in the statement of operations a gain or loss from the change in fair value of the warrant in the period in which the change occurred. We calculated the fair value of the warrants outstanding using the Black-Scholes model. A gain results principally from a decline in our share price during the period and a loss results principally from an increase in our share price.

Transaction costs allocated to warrant liabilities and Loss on issuance of warrant liabilities. Proceeds of offerings are allocated between common shares and warrants first by allocating to the warrants classified as a liability based on their fair value and then allocating the residual to the equity instruments, which would include pre-funded warrants. As the fair value of the liability classified warrants in the August 2024 offering exceeded the total proceeds, no consideration was allocated to the Common Shares or Pre-Funded Warrants. The full proceeds of the August 2024 offering were recorded to warrant liabilities, with an initial liability of 6.1 million, and a loss on initial recognition of 0.8 million. The loss on modification of certain warrants of 0.4 million was also recorded as a loss on issuance of warrant liabilities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Transaction costs related to the offering were correspondingly fully allocated to warrant liabilities, and 1.0 million in related transaction costs were expensed during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Interest income, net. Interest income, ne t decreased by approximately 0.6 million f or the comparable quarterly periods due to a decreasing cash balance and decreasing interest rates during the past year.

(18,566) 

As of September 30, 2024, there w as 0.4 million of cash on hand in a bank account in Australia and we know of no related limitations impacting our liquidity in Australia. 
 
 Cash used in operating activities 
 
 Cash used in operations was 18.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . This 0.1 million increase over the prior year period of 18.7 million was primarily due to the timing of costs incurred and associated payments for drug production and clinical trial expenses. 
 
 Cash provided by fin ancing activities 
 
 On August 19, 2024, we announced the closing of our previously announced public offering of 283,000 shares of common stock and 2,183,368 pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of common stock, Series A warrants to purchase up to 2,466,368 shares of common stock and Series B warrants to purchase up to 2,466,368 shares of common stock, at a combined public offering price of 2.23 per share (or per pre-funded warrant in lieu thereof) and accompanying warrants. We received gross proceeds of 5.5 million, before deducting the placement agent's fees and other offering expenses. 
 
 We believe that our cash on hand and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, is sufficient to fund our planned operations into the first quarter of 2025. This takes into account cash outlays for preparations for clinical trials beyond the current active trials. The continuation of our Company as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain necessary financing to continue operations and the attainment of profitable operations. We must seek additional funding of approximately 15 million to support MIRACLE and our operations into the third quarter of 2025 through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, government or other third-party funding, commercialization, marketing and distribution arrangements, other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements and delay planned cash outlays or a combination thereof to continue our operations in the near term. We cannot provide assurance that such events or a combination thereof can be achieved. 

In March 2022, we received a subpoena from the SEC requesting information and documents, including materials related to certain individuals (none of which are our officers or directors) and entities, and materials related to the development of and statements regarding our drug candidate for the treatment of COVID-19. We have received, and expect to continue to receive, periodic further requests from the SEC staff with respect to this matter. We are not aware of the specific nature of the underlying investigation by the SEC, and to the extent that this investigation relates to prior public disclosures that we have made, we believe in the accuracy and adequacy of such prior disclosures. The correspondence from the SEC transmitting the subpoena to us states that the SEC is trying to determine whether there have been any violations of federal securities laws, but that its investigation does not mean that the SEC has concluded that anyone has violated the law or that the SEC has a negative opinion of any person, entity, or security. We cannot predict when this matter will be resolved or what, if any, action the SEC may take following the conclusion of the investigation. We expensed approximate
 ly 0.1 million and 0.4 million in related general and administrative fees and expenses for the three months ended 
 September 30, 2024 and 2023
 , respectively, and approximate
 ly 0.2 million and 1.4 million for the nine months ended 
 September 30, 2024 and 2023
 , respectively . 

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 
 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and use of estimates from those disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS 
 
 Not applicable as we are a smaller reporting company. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that material information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), who is our principal executive officer, and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), who is our principal financial and accounting officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Our CEO and CFO have evaluated these disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q and have determined that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15-d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 None. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 For information regarding factors that could affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, refer to the section entitled Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Except as updated below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in Item II, Item 1A in our prior quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed during this fiscal year, as filed with the SEC. 
 
 We will require significant additional funding to complete the MIRACLE trial, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, and, if not so available, may require us to delay, limit, reduce or cease our operations. 
 
 We have used and we intend to use our current cash resources and the proceeds from any possible future offerings, to, among other uses, advance our portfolio through preclinical studies and into INDs or their equivalent, and sponsoring research at MD Anderson and HPI. Developing pharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is expensive. We estimate supporting of MIRACLE and our operations into the third quarter of 2025 will require additional funds beyond our current cash as of September 30, 2024, of approximately 15 million. As such, based on our current cash, in order to fund our operations, including MIRACLE, we will need to raise significant financing for which we have no commitments. If the FDA or its EU equivalent requires that we perform additional nonclinical studies or clinical trials, our expenses would further increase beyond what we currently expect and the anticipated timing of any potential approval of Annamycin would likely be delayed. Further, there can be no assurance that the costs we will need to incur to obtain regulatory approval of Annamycin will not increase. 
 
 Recently enacted legislation, future legislation and healthcare reform measures may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval for and commercialize Annamycin and any future product candidates and may affect the prices we may set . 
 
 At the federal level, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, Promoting Competition in the American Economy, with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. In addition, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), among other things, (1) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain high-cost, single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and (2) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. The IRA permits HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although the Medicare drug price negotiation program is currently subject to legal challenges. HHS has and will continue to issue and update guidance as these programs are implemented. It is currently unclear how the IRA will be implemented but is likely to have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. Under the IRA, certain categories of drugs are excluded from price negotiations, including drugs that receive orphan drug designation as the only FDA-approved indication. While we have obtained orphan drug designation for Annamycin, if we seek additional indications, or fail to maintain our orphan drug status, we may become subject to the price negotiation process. This could reduce the ultimate price that we receive for Annamycin, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial conditions, and prospects. Further, in response to the Biden administration s October 2022 executive order, on February 14, 2023, HHS released a report outlining three new models for testing by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation which will be evaluated on their ability to lower the cost of drugs, promote accessibility, and improve quality of care. It is unclear whether the models will be utilized in any health reform measures in the future.

At the state level, individual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. 
 
 In June 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed its longstanding approach under the Chevron doctrine, which provided for judicial deference to regulatory agencies, including the FDA. As a result of this decision, we cannot be sure whether there will be increased challenges to existing agency regulations or how lower courts will apply the decision in the context of other regulatory schemes without more specific guidance from the U.S. Supreme Court. For example, this decision may result in more companies bringing lawsuits against the FDA to challenge longstanding decisions and policies of the FDA, which could undermine the FDA s authority, lead to uncertainties in the industry, and disrupt the FDA s normal operations, which could impact the timely review of any regulatory filings or applications we submit to the FDA. 
 
 We cannot predict the likelihood, nature, or extent of health reform initiatives that may arise from future legislation or administrative action. We expect that the Affordable Care Act and other healthcare reform measures, including those that may be adopted in the future may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from third-party payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize Annamycin, if approved.
