SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Quarterly Report) contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. We make such forward-looking statements pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other federal securities laws. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report are forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made and are not guarantees of future performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by words such as anticipate, believe, contemplate, continue, consider, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, potential, predict, project, seek, should, target, will, would or the negative or plural of these words or other comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating results and may include, but are not limited to, statements about: 
 the pending transaction with H. Lundbeck A/S, announced on October 14, 2024; 

our plans to research, develop and commercialize our product candidates; 

the initiation, progress, success, cost and timing of our clinical trials and product development activities; 

the therapeutic potential of our product candidates, and the disease indications for which we intend to develop our product candidates; 

our ability and timing to advance our product candidates into, and to successfully initiate, conduct, enroll and complete, clinical trials; 

our ability to obtain approval by any regulatory authority for marketing of our product candidates; 

our ability to manufacture our product candidates for clinical development and, if approved, for commercialization, and the timing and costs of such manufacture; 

the performance of third parties in connection with the development and manufacture of our product candidates, including third parties conducting our clinical trials as well as third-party suppliers and manufacturers; 

our ability to obtain funding for our operations, including funding necessary to initiate and complete clinical trials of our product candidates; 

the size and growth of the potential markets for our product candidates and our ability to serve those markets; 

the potential scope, duration and value of our intellectual property rights; 

our ability, and the ability of our licensors, to obtain, maintain, defend and enforce intellectual property rights protecting our product candidates, and our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties; 

our ability to recruit and retain key personnel; and 

other risks and uncertainties, including those described under Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Quarterly Report. 

Any forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report reflect our current views with respect to future events or to our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. In addition, statements that we believe and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based upon information available to us as of the date of this report, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain and you are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements. 
 Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, among other things, those listed under Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Quarterly Report. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements or rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Except as required by law, we 
 1 

assume no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements for any reason, even if new information becomes available in the future. 
 Unless the context otherwise indicates, references in this Quarterly Report to the terms, Longboard, the Company, we, our and us refer to Longboard Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and references to our common stock refer to our voting common stock.

SUMMARY OF RISKS AS SOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS 
 An investment in shares of our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Below is a list of the more significant risks associated with our business. This summary does not address all of the risks that we face. Additional discussion of the risks listed in this summary, as well as other risks that we face, are set forth under Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report. Some of the material risks associated with our business include the following: 
 We may not complete the pending transaction with Lundbeck within the timeframe we anticipate, or at all, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results, and/or operations; 

We have a limited operating history, and we have incurred losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. We may never generate any revenue or become profitable or, if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain it. 

We will need substantial additional capital to finance our operations, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. The effects of macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical events, including political elections, economic slowdowns, recessions, inflation, high interest rates, bank failures and tightening of credit markets, the conflicts in Ukraine, the Middle East or elsewhere, or otherwise, may limit our access to capital. Failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate certain of our product development efforts or other operations. 

All of our product candidates are in the research and development stage; our product candidates may not be approved by any regulatory authority for marketing. All of our other development efforts are in the earlier research stage. If we are unable to advance our product candidates in clinical development, obtain regulatory approval and ultimately commercialize our product candidates, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed. 

Clinical and preclinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome. Topline data from a clinical trial may not accurately reflect the complete study results and remain subject to audit, and final data may differ materially from topline data. In addition, the results of prior clinical trials and preclinical studies of our product candidates are not necessarily predictive of future results. 

Because we have multiple product candidates in our pipeline and are considering a variety of target indications, we may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success. 

The regulatory approval processes of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and comparable foreign authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, our business will be substantially harmed. 

Receiving FDA designations, including Breakthrough Therapy designation for bexicaserin for the treatment of seizures associated with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) and Rare Pediatric Disease and Orphan Drug designations for bexicaserin for the treatment of Dravet syndrome, may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval processes, and does not mean bexicaserin will receive marketing approval for any particular indication or at all. 

If the market opportunities for our product candidates are smaller than we estimate, even assuming approval of a product candidate, our business may suffer. Because the patient populations in the market for our product candidates may be small, we must be able to successfully identify patients and acquire a significant market share to achieve profitability and growth. 

We currently have a limited number of personnel with marketing and sales experience and have no experience as a company in commercializing products, and we may have to invest significant resources to develop these capabilities. If we are unable to establish adequate marketing and sales capabilities or agreements with third parties to market and sell our products, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products. 

We intend to rely on third parties to conduct, supervise and monitor our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and if those third parties perform in an unsatisfactory manner, it may harm our business. 

The trading price of our common stock may be volatile and impacted by sales of shares by existing stockholders or the issuances of shares by us. 

3 

We depend on intellectual property licensed from third parties, including Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Arena), which is now a subsidiary of Pfizer, Inc. (Pfizer), and the failure by us or our licensors to protect the licensed intellectual property or the termination of our license could result in the loss of significant rights, which would harm our business. 

If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our current or any future product candidates, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets.

additional awards may be granted under the 2020 Plan and all outstanding awards under the 2020 Plan remain subject to the terms of the 2020 Plan. In October 2023, the compensation committee of the Company s board of directors amended the 2021 Plan to incorporate an additional pool of shares that the Company is authorized to issue to individuals who satisfy the standards for inducement grants under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5635(c)(4) and the related guidance under Nasdaq IM 5635-1, including individuals who were not previously an employee or director of the Company or are following a bona fide period of non-employment, in each case as an inducement material to such individual entering into employment with the Company. In May 2024, the compensation committee of the Company s board of directors further amended the 2021 Plan to increase the inducement grant pool to shares. As of September 30, 2024, the 2021 Plan authorizes and provides for the issuance of up to shares of comm on stock, which consists of shares of common stock subject to outstanding options, shares of common stock subject to outstanding restricted stock units and shares of common stock available for grant. The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2021 Plan automatically increases on January 1 of each calendar year, through January 1, 2031, in an amount equal to (i) 5 of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on December 31 of the fiscal year before the date of each automatic increase (determined on an as-converted to voting common stock basis, without regard to any limitations on the conversion of the non-voting common stock), or (ii) a lesser number of shares determined by the Company s board of directors prior to the applicable January 1. Recipients of stock options are eligible to purchase shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price equal to no less than the estimated fair market value of such stock on the date of grant. The maximum term of options granted under the 2020 and 2021 Plans (or collectively, the Equity Plans) is and, in general, the options issued under the Equity Plans vest over a one to period from the vesting commencement date.

Determination of Fair Value of Common Stock. The Company utilizes the closing stock price of the common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market as both the exercise price and an input to the Black Scholes option pricing model to determine stock-based compensation expense. Risk-free interest rate . The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities similar to the expected term of the awards. Expected dividend yield . The Company bases the expected dividend yield assumption on the fact that it has never paid cash dividends and has no present intention to pay cash dividends and, therefore, used an expected dividend yield of zero. Expected volatility . Since the Company is a newly public company and does not have a trading history for its common stock, the expected volatility assumption is based on volatilities of a peer group of similar companies whose share prices are publicly available. The peer group was developed based on companies in the biotechnology industry. The Company will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of its own stock price becomes available. Expected life . The expected life represents the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding. Because the Company does not have historical exercise behavior, it determines the expected life assumption using the simplified method, for employees, which is an average of the contractual term of the option and its vesting period. The expected term for nonemployee options is equal to the contractual term.

Total stock-based compensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included million and million of expense related to the vesting of RSUs. There was such expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to outstanding unvested stock option awards and outstanding unvested RSUs was million and million, respectively, which is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average period of approximatel y y ears and years, respectively. Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Company's board of directors adopted the 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) in February 2021, the Company's stockholders approved the ESPP in March 2021 and it became effective on March 11, 2021. As of September 30, 2024 , the ESPP authorizes the issuance of shares of common stock under purchase rights granted to our employees. The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance automatically increases on January 1 of each calendar year, through January 1, 2031, by the lesser of (i) of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on the last day of the fiscal year before the date of the automatic increase (determining on an as-converted to voting common stock basis, without regard to any limitations on the conversion of the non-voting common stock); and (ii) such number of shares of common stock that would cause the aggregate number of shares of common stock then reserved for issuance under the ESPP to equal shares; provided that before the date of any such increase, the Company s board of directors may determine that such increase will be for a lesser amount of shares. The ESPP permits eligible employees, who elect to participate in an offering under the ESPP, to contribute up to of their eligible earnings (as defined in the ESPP) towards the purchase of shares of common stock. Unless otherwise determined by the Company's board of directors, the price at which stock is purchased under the ESPP is equal to of the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the commencement date of each offering period or the relevant purchase date, whichever is lower. There are certain service requirements for an employee to be eligible to participate in the ESPP, and no employee may purchase shares under the ESPP at a rate in excess of worth of common stock (as determined in accordance with the ESPP). Offering durations under the ESPP may not be longer than , and the Company may specify shorter purchase periods within each offering. The ESPP is considered a compensatory plan as defined by the authoritative guidance for stock-based compensation. As of September 30, 2024 , the ESPP had not yet been implemented.

 . At the effective time of the Merger (Effective Time), each Share then outstanding (other than Shares (a) held by the Company (or in the Company s treasury), Parent, Purchaser, any other direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, or by stockholders of the Company who have properly exercised and perfected their statutory rights of appraisal under Delaware law, or (b) irrevocably accepted for purchase in the Offer) will be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price (Merger Consideration), without interest and subject to any applicable withholding of taxes. Each of the Company s stock options (Options), to the extent unvested, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will accelerate and become fully vested and exercisable effective immediately prior to, and contingent upon the occurrence of, the Effective Time. As of the Effective Time, each Option that is then outstanding and unexercised will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive cash, without interest, equal to the product of (a) the total number of Shares subject to such Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (b) the excess of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price payable per Share under such Option. Generally, each restricted stock unit award (RSU) outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (a) the total number of Shares issuable in settlement of such RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (b) the Merger Consideration. The Merger Agreement includes representations, warranties and covenants of the parties customary for a transaction of this nature. From the date of the Merger Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of the Merger Agreement, the Company has agreed, subject to certain exceptions, to operate its business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice and has agreed to certain other operating covenants, as set forth more fully in the Merger Agreement. The Company has also agreed to customary no shop restrictions on its ability to solicit discussions or negotiations with third parties regarding alternative acquisition proposals. Notwithstanding these restrictions, the Company may under certain circumstances provide, pursuant to an acceptable confidentiality agreement, information to and engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with third parties with respect to an unsolicited bona fide alternative acquisition proposal that the board of directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a superior acquisition proposal. The Merger Agreement also requires that the Company s board of directors recommend that the stockholders of the Company accept the Offer and tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer (the

The Merger Agreement further provides that Parent will be required to pay the Company a reverse termination fee of million in cash in the event the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances related to antitrust laws. Specifically, this reverse termination fee is payable by Parent to the Company if the Merger Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company either (i) due to the existence of a permanent legal restraint on the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement under antitrust laws or (ii) due to the Offer not being consummated by July 14, 2025 (or such later date as may be extended pursuant to the Merger Agreement) and certain conditions related to antitrust laws having not been satisfied. RSU Grant On October 25, 2024, the Company granted a total of RSUs to employees. The RSUs will vest on the earlier of the one-year anniversary of the grant date or the date the employee is involuntarily terminated. At the Effective Time, the RSUs will convert into a right to receive a cash payment on the vesting date in an amount equal to the number of RSUs granted, multiplied by per share.

Item 2 . Management s Discuss ion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our unaudited condensed financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 12, 2024 (our 2023 Annual Report). 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors section of this Quarterly Report, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. You should carefully read Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Quarterly Report to gain an understanding of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. 
 
 Overview and Recent Developments 
 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel, transformative medicines for neurological diseases. We were formed in January 2020 by Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Arena) to advance a portfolio of centrally acting product candidates designed to be highly selective for specific G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Our small molecule product candidates were discovered out of the same platform at Arena that represents a culmination of more than 20 years of world-class GPCR research. Arena was purchased by Pfizer, Inc. (Pfizer) on March 11, 2022, and is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer. 
 
 We are currently focused on developing the following product candidates in our pipeline, both of which are licensed from Arena: 
 Bexicaserin (LP352) is an oral, centrally acting, 5-hydroxytryptamine 2C receptor subtype (5-HT2C) superagonist. In the first quarter of 2024, we announced topline data from a Phase 1b/2a clinical trial, the PACIFIC Study, evaluating participants ages 12 to 65 years old with a broad range of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs), including Dravet syndrome (DS), Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), and other DEEs. The FDA has granted us Breakthrough Therapy designation for bexicaserin for the treatment of seizures associated with DEEs for patients two years of age or older and Rare Pediatric Disease and Orphan Drug designations for bexicaserin for the treatment of Dravet syndrome. In the third quarter of 2024, we announced the initiation of our global Phase 3 program for bexicaserin, the DEEp Program. 

LP659 is a centrally acting, sphingosine-1-phosphate, or S1P, receptor subtypes 1 and 5 modulator. W e initiated a Phase 1 single-ascending dose (SAD) clinical trial for LP659 in healthy volunteers in November 2023 and completed the study in June 2024 . The FDA has placed the proposed Phase 1 multiple-ascending dose (MAD) study for LP659 on full clinical hold, and we are evaluating options for LP659 pending additional discussion with the FDA. 

Since our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development activities, organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, in-licensing intellectual property rights and establishing our intellectual property portfolio, and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We have principally financed our operations to date through the private placement of convertible preferred stock and the completion of our initial public offering (IPO) of our common stock in March 2021. To date, we have raised gross proceeds of approximately 56.0 million from the issuance of our convertible preferred stock, 84.8 million from our IPO, 23.0 million and 241.5 million from our February 2023 and January 2024 follow-on public offerings, respectively, 59.9 million from our March 2024 private placement of non-voting common stock, and 8.8 million from our at-the-market offering. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of 288.4 million. 
 We have incurred net losses since our inception. Our net losses were 24.5 million, 61.3 million, 12.9 million and 39.4 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 201.9 million. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our clinical trials and preclinical studies and our expenditures on other research and development activities. We expect that our expenses and operating losses will increase substantially as product candidates advance through preclinical studies and clinical trials, and as we expand our clinical, regulatory, quality and manufacturing capabilities, incur more significant commercialization expenses for marketing, sales, manufacturing and distribution leading up to and, if ever, after we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, and incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. We expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. However, our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a 
 21 

forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially. We base our estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could deplete our capital resources sooner than we expect. 
 We do not expect to generate any revenues from product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more product candidates, which will not be for many years, if ever. Accordingly, until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of our product candidates, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our research and development programs, future commercialization efforts or other operations, or grant rights to develop and market our product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves, which would have a negative impact on our financial condition. 
 
 Agreement and Plan of Merger 
 
 On October 14, 2024, we entered into the Merger Agreement. See Note 11 to the condensed financial statements included in this report for additional information. 
 
 Components of Our Results of Operations 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Our operating expenses consist of (i) research and development expenses and (ii) general and administrative expenses. 
 
 Research and Development 
 
 Our research and development expenses consist primarily of direct and indirect costs incurred in connection with the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates. 
 
 Direct costs include: 
 external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with CROs, investigative sites, consultants and other third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials; and 

costs related to manufacturing our product candidates for preclinical studies and clinical trials, including fees paid to third-party manufacturers. 

Indirect costs include: 
 personnel-related costs, which include salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits and other employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel engaged in research and development functions; and 

other various expenses. 

Research and development expenses are recognized as incurred and payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are capitalized until the goods or services are received. We track direct costs by stage of program, clinical or preclinical and other early stage research. However, we do not track indirect costs on a program specific or stage of program basis because these costs are deployed across multiple programs and, as such, are not separately classified. 
 
 We expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of our product candidates, particularly as product candidates in later stages of development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of development. We cannot determine with certainty the timing of the initiation, duration or completion costs of future clinical trials and preclinical studies of our product candidates due to the inherently unpredictable nature of clinical and preclinical development. Clinical and preclinical development timelines, the probability of success and development costs can differ materially from expectations. 
 
 22 

We anticipate that we will make determinations as to which product candidates and development programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each product candidate or program on an ongoing basis in response to the results of ongoing and future preclinical studies and clinical trials, regulatory developments and our ongoing assessments as to each product candidate s commercial potential. We will need to raise substantial additional capital in the future. In addition, we cannot forecast which product candidates may be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements may occur, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements. 
 
 Our research and development expenses may vary significantly based on a variety of factors, such as: 
 the scope, rate of progress, expense and results of our preclinical development activities; 

the phase of development of our product candidates; 

per participant clinical trial costs; 

the number of clinical trials required for approval; 

the number of sites included in our ongoing and planned clinical trials; 

the number of patients that participate in our ongoing and planned clinical trials; 

the countries in which our clinical trials are conducted; 

uncertainties in clinical trial design and participant enrollment or drop out or discontinuation rates; 

potential additional safety monitoring requested by regulatory agencies; 

the duration of patient participation in our ongoing and planned clinical trials and follow-up; 

the efficacy and safety profile of our product candidates; 

the timing, receipt and terms of any approvals from applicable regulatory authorities, including the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities; 

significant and changing government regulation and regulatory guidance; 

potential additional trials requested by regulatory agencies; 

the cost and timing of manufacturing our product candidates; 

establishing clinical and commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers in order to ensure that we or our third-party manufacturers are able to make product successfully; 

the extent to which we establish additional strategic collaborations or other arrangements; 

the impact of any business interruptions to our operations or to those of the third parties with whom we work; and 

maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of our product candidates following approval, if any, of our product candidates. 

A change in the outcome of any of these or other variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. 
 
 General and Administrative 
 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, which include salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits and other employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance and other administrative functions. Other significant costs include legal fees relating to corporate matters, professional fees for accounting and consulting services and facility-related costs. 
 
 23 

With the exception of our expenses in the third and fourth quarters of 2024 which include or are expected to include significant merger related expenses, we expect that our ongoing general and administrative expenses will increase modestly for the foreseeable future to support our increased research and development activities and increased costs of operating as a public company and in building our internal resources. These increased costs will include increased expenses related to audit and legal services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements, prosecuting and maintaining our patent portfolio, and investor and public relations activities associated with operating as a public company.

Research and development expenses were 21.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 11.0 million, or 105 , compared to 10.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The net increase of 11.0 million is primarily related to increases of 5.9 million in clinical trial and preclinical expenses related to bexicaserin, 0.6 million in preclinical programs and other early stage research, 4.1 million in personnel-related expenses and 0.4 million in other miscellaneous research and development related expenses. 
 
 Research and development expenses were 55.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 23.5 million, or 75 , compared to 31.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net increase of 23.5 million is primarily related to increases of 12.4 million in clinical trial and preclinical expenses related to bexicaserin, 1.4 million in clinical trial and preclinical expenses related to LP659, 1.0 million in preclinical programs and other early stage research, 7.9 million in personnel-related expenses and 0.8 million in other miscellaneous research and development related expenses. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses were 6.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 3.6 million, or 116 , compared to 3.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The net increase of 3.6 million is primarily related to increases of 2.1 million in personnel-related expenses, 1.2 million in consulting and professional fees (which includes 0.7 of merger related expenses), and 0.3 million of miscellaneous expenses. 
 24 

General and administrative expenses were 16.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 7.2 million, or 75 , compared to 9.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net increase of 7.2 million is primarily related to increases of 4.8 million in personnel-related expenses, 2.1 million in consulting and professional fees (which includes 0.7 million of merger related expenses) and 0.3 million of miscellaneous expenses. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of 288.4 million and working capital of 274.7 million to fund future operations. As of December 31, 2023, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of 48.5 million and working capital of 40.4 million to fund future operations. 
 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 
 We have funded our operations primarily through available cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and the sale and issuance of common stock and convertible preferred stock. 
 
 In October 2020, we completed a 56.0 million private placement of our Series A convertible preferred stock. 
 
 In connection with our IPO in March 2021, we issued and sold 5,298,360 shares of common stock, which included 298,360 shares of our common stock issued pursuant to the over-allotment option granted to the underwriters to purchase additional shares of common stock, at a public offering price of 16.00 per share. We raised 76.2 million in net proceeds from the IPO after deducting underwriters discounts and commissions of 5.9 million and issuance costs of 2.6 million. 
 
 In February 2023, we raised 23.0 million in a follow-on public offering. We issued and sold 5,750,000 shares of common stock which included 750,000 shares of our common stock issued pursuant to the over-allotment option granted to the underwriters to purchase additional shares of common stock, at a public offering price of 4.00 per share. We raised 21.2 million in net proceeds from the follow-on public offering after deducting underwriters' commissions of 1.4 million and issuance costs of 0.4 million. 
 In January 2024, we raised 241.5 million in a follow-on public offering. We issued and sold 11,500,000 shares of common stock which included 1,500,000 shares of common stock sold pursuant to the full exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares, at a public offering price of 21.00 per share. We raised 226.5 million in net proceeds from the follow-on public offering after deducting underwriters' commissions of 14.5 million and other expenses of 0.5 million. 
 In March 2024, we completed a 59.9 million private placement of our non-voting common stock. 
 
 Sales Agreement 
 In September 2022, we entered into a Controlled Equity Offering SM Sales Agreement (the Sales Agreement) with Cantor Fitzgerald Co., as sales agent (Cantor Fitzgerald), pursuant to which we may issue and sell our common stock from time to time through an at the market offering (ATM) program under the Sales Agreement. We have no obligation to sell any shares of common stock under the Sales Agreement and may at any time suspend sales under the Sales Agreement. Cantor Fitzgerald will be entitled to compensation in an amount of 3 of the gross proceeds of any shares of common stock sold under the Sales Agreement. In August 2023, we filed a prospectus supplement to offer up to 75.0 million of shares of common stock under the Sales Agreement. During 2023 we sold 1,422,250 shares of our common stock under the Sales Agreement for gross proceeds of 8.8 million. In March 2024, we filed a sales agreement prospectus to offer up to 150.0 million of shares of common stock under the Sales Agreement (exclusive of shares sold previously). As of September 30, 2024, we had not sold any shares of common stock pursuant to the most recent sales agreement prospectus. 
 During the pendency of the Merger, we are prohibited from selling shares pursuant to the Sales Agreement. 
 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 
 The following discussion assumes that the Merger with Lundbeck is not consummated and we continue to operate as an independent company. During the pendency of the Merger, we are prohibited from raising capital through equity or debt financing and are subject to other restrictions that generally prohibit transactions and operations outside the ordinary course. 
 
 We have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception and anticipate we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. 
 25 

We expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. We believe we will meet longer-term expected future cash requirements and obligations beyond the next 12 months by utilizing our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements. However, our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially. We have based our estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could deplete our capital resources sooner than we expect. Additionally, the process of testing product candidates in clinical trials is costly, and the timing of progress and expenses in these trials is uncertain. Our ability to fund longer-term operating needs will depend on our ability to commercialize product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval, our ability to access the capital markets and other factors, including those discussed in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Quarterly Report. 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 
 the type, number, scope, progress, expansions, results, costs and timing of our research programs, preclinical studies and clinical trials for our current and any future product candidates and the potential indications which we are pursuing or may choose to pursue in the future; 

the outcome, timing and costs of regulatory review of our product candidates; 

the costs and timing of manufacturing for our product candidates, including commercial manufacturing; 

our efforts to enhance operational systems and hire additional personnel to satisfy our obligations as a public company, including enhanced internal controls over financial reporting; 

the costs associated with hiring additional personnel and consultants as our preclinical and clinical activities increase; 

the terms and timing of establishing and maintaining collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements; 

the costs of obtaining, expanding, maintaining and enforcing our patent and other intellectual property rights; 

the costs and timing of establishing or securing sales and marketing and distribution capabilities, whether alone or with third parties, to commercialize product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval, if any; 

the timing and amount of the payments we are obligated to make under the Arena License Agreement; 

our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors and adequate market share and revenue for any approved products; 

patients willingness to pay out-of-pocket for any approved products in the absence of coverage and/or adequate reimbursement from third-party payors; 

costs associated with any product candidates, products or technologies that we may in-license or acquire; and 

if we experience any delays or encounter any issues with any of the above. 

Developing pharmaceutical products, including conducting research, preclinical studies and clinical trials, is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval for any product candidates or generate revenue from the sale of any product candidate for which we may obtain marketing approval. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for at least several years, if ever. As a result, we will need substantial additional financing to support our continuing operations and further the development of and commercialize our product candidates. 
 
 26 

Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of our product candidates, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our ability to raise additional funds may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be or could be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing and equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaborations, or other similar arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, future revenue streams or research programs or may have to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us and/or may reduce the value of our common stock. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our research and development programs, future commercialization efforts or other operations, or grant rights to develop and market our product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves, which would have a negative impact on our financial condition.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a periodic basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 
 While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing in our 2023 Annual Report, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as the policies relate to the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates during the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in Part II, Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Accrued Research and Development Expenses 
 
 As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses as of each balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, based on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met, but some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. If timelines or contracts are modified based upon changes in the protocol or scope of work to be performed, we modify our estimates and accruals accordingly on a prospective basis. 
 
 We base our expenses related to external research and development services on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with vendors that conduct research and development on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or the amount of prepaid expenses accordingly. 
 
 Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have not been any material differences between our estimates of such expenses and the amounts actually incurred. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 10.0 percent increase in our liability for accrued research and development expenses would have resulted in an increase to our net loss of approximately 1.1 million. 
 
 Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status 
 We are an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (JOBS Act), and as such, we can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This provision allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards, and therefore we will not be subject to the same requirements to adopt new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. 
 We are also a smaller reporting company as defined in the Exchange Act. We may take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies and will be able to take advantage of these scaled disclosures for so long as our voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter, or our annual revenue is less than 100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and our voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter. 
 28 

As of June 30, 2024, the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded 700.0 million. As a result, we will be a large accelerated filer and thus will cease to be an emerging growth company effective December 31, 2024. Additionally, we will no longer qualify as a smaller reporting company beginning with our first Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ending March 31, 2025. 
 29 

Item 3 . Quantitative and Qua litative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 Under SEC rules and regulations, as a smaller reporting company we are not required to provide the information required by this item. 
 Item 4 . Con trols and Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based upon such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of such date. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 30 

PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Item 1 . Legal Proc eedings. 
 
 From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business activities. There are no material legal proceedings to which we are a party or of which any of our property is the subject. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, reputational harm and other factors. 
 
 Item 1A . Risk Factors. 
 
 An investment in shares of our common stock is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information in this Quarterly Report, including our unaudited condensed financial statements and the related notes and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations before deciding whether to purchase, hold or sell shares in our common stock. The occurrence of any of the risks described below could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, growth prospects and/or stock price, or cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements we have made in this Quarterly Report and those we may make from time to time. You should consider all of the risk factors described when evaluating our business. We have marked with an asterisk ) those risk factors that are new risk factors or ones containing substantive changes from the similarly titled risk factors included in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Pending Acquisition by Lundbeck 
 
 We may not complete the pending transaction with Lundbeck within the timeframe we anticipate, or at all, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results, and/or operations. 
 
 On October 14, 2024, the Company announced it entered into the Merger Agreement with Lundbeck, providing for the merger of the Company with Payor, with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Payor. 
 
 Consummation of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including, without limitation, the absence of certain legal restraints preventing or otherwise making illegal the consummation of the Merger, no material adverse effect with respect to the Company having occurred since the signing of the Merger Agreement, the expiration or termination of any waiting periods under the HSR Act applicable to the Merger, the obtainment of any clearance or affirmative approvals applicable to the Merger under the antitrust and foreign direct investment laws of other applicable jurisdictions, and the tender of sufficient shares of the Company s voting common stock by stockholders. In addition, the Merger Agreement may be terminated under certain specified circumstances, including, but not limited to, a change in the recommendation of our Board of Directors or a termination of the Merger Agreement by us to enter into an agreement for a Superior Proposal, as defined in the Merger Agreement. As a result, we cannot assure you that the transaction with Lundbeck will be completed, or that, if completed, it will be exactly on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement or within the expected timeframe. 
 
 If the transaction is not completed within the expected timeframe or at all, we may be subject to a number of material risks. The price of our common stock may decline to the extent that current market prices of our common stock reflect a market assumption that the transaction will be completed. We could be required to pay Lundbeck a termination fee of 86.1 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated under specific circumstances described in the Merger Agreement. The failure to complete the transaction also may result in negative publicity and negatively affect our relationship with our stockholders, employees, regulators, and other business partners. We may also be required to devote significant time and resources to litigation related to any failure to complete the Merger or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the Merger Agreement. 
 
 The pendency of the transaction with Lundbeck could adversely affect our business, financial results and/or operations. 
 
 Our efforts to complete the transaction could cause substantial disruptions in, and create uncertainty surrounding, our business, which may materially adversely affect our results of operation and our business. Uncertainty as to whether the transaction will be completed may affect our ability to recruit prospective employees or to retain and motivate existing employees. Employee retention or focus may be particularly challenging while the transaction is pending because employees may experience uncertainty about their roles following consummation of the transaction. A substantial amount of our management s and certain employees attention is being directed toward the completion of the transaction and thus is being diverted from our day-to-day operations. Uncertainty as to our future could adversely affect our business and our relationship with collaborators, vendors, customers, regulators, and other business partners. For example, vendors, collaborators, and other counterparties may defer decisions concerning working with us, or seek to change existing business relationships with us. Changes to or termination of existing business relationships could adversely affect our 
 31 

results of operations and financial condition, as well as the market price of our common stock. The adverse effects of the pendency of the transaction could be exacerbated by any delays in completion of the transaction or termination of the Merger Agreement. 
 
 While the Merger Agreement is in effect, we are subject to restrictions on our business activities. 
 
 While the Merger Agreement is in effect, we are subject to restrictions on our business activities, generally requiring us to conduct our business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice in all material respects, and subjecting us to a variety of specified restrictions absent Lundbeck s prior consent. These limitations include, among other things, restrictions on our ability to acquire other businesses and assets, dispose of our assets, make investments, enter into certain contracts, repurchase or issue securities, pay dividends, make capital expenditures, take certain actions relating to intellectual property, amend our organizational documents, and incur indebtedness. These restrictions could prevent us from pursuing strategic business opportunities, taking actions with respect to our business that we may consider advantageous and responding effectively and/or timely to competitive pressures and industry developments, and may, as a result, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 In certain instances, the Merger Agreement requires us to pay a termination fee to Lundbeck, which could require us to use available cash that would have otherwise been available for general corporate purposes. 
 
 Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, we may be required to pay Lundbeck a termination fee of 86.1 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated under specific circumstances described in the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, in connection with a change in the recommendation of our Board of Directors or a termination of the Merger Agreement by us to enter into an agreement for a Superior Proposal, as defined in the Merger Agreement. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under such circumstances, the termination fee we may be required to pay under the Merger Agreement may require us to use available cash that would have otherwise been available for general corporate purposes and other uses. For these and other reasons, termination of the Merger Agreement could materially and adversely affect our business operations and financial condition, which in turn would materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock. 
 
 We have incurred, and will continue to incur, direct and indirect costs as a result of the pending transaction with Lundbeck. 
 
 We have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs and expenses, including fees for professional services and other transaction costs, in connection with the pending transaction. We must pay substantially all of these costs and expenses whether or not the transaction is completed. 
 
 There are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of these costs and expenses. 
 
 Litigation may arise in connection with the Merger, which could be costly and divert management s attention and otherwise materially harm our business. 
 
 Lawsuits may be filed challenging the disclosures contained in the proxy statement and/or challenging other aspects of the proposed Merger. Regardless of the outcome of any future litigation related to the proposed Merger, such litigation may be time-consuming and expensive and may distract our management from running the day-to-day operations of our business. The litigation costs and diversion of management s attention and resources to address the claims and counterclaims in any litigation related to the proposed Merger may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. If the acquisition is not consummated for any reason, litigation could be filed in connection with the failure to consummate the acquisition. Any litigation related to the proposed Merger may result in negative publicity or an unfavorable impression of us, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock, impair our ability to recruit or retain employees, damage our relationships with our partners, or otherwise materially harm our operations and financial performance. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Limited Operating History, Financial Position and Need For Additional Capital 
 
 We have a limited operating history, and we have incurred losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. We may never generate any revenue or become profitable or, if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain it. 
 
 We were incorporated in January 2020, and we have a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects. Our operations to date have been primarily focused on organizing and staffing our company, research and development activities, business planning, raising capital, in-licensing intellectual property rights and establishing our intellectual property portfolio, and providing general and administrative support for these operations. In the first quarter of 2024 we announced topline results from a Phase 1b/2a clinical trial for our most advanced product candidate, bexicaserin (LP352). In the third quarter of 2024 we announced the initiation of our global Phase 3 program for bexicaserin, the DEEp Program. We have also completed a Phase 1 SAD 
 32 

clinical trial in healthy volunteers for our next most advanced product candidate, LP659. The FDA has placed a full clinical hold on our proposed MAD study for LP659, and we are evaluating our options for LP659 pending additional discussion with the FDA. of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in the biopharmaceutical industry, including an ability to obtain regulatory approval of a product candidate, manufacture any product candidate at commercial scale, or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization. In addition, we have limited experience completing clinical trials as a company. Consequently, any predictions about our future performance may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a history of successfully developing and commercializing biopharmaceutical products. 
 
 Investment in biopharmaceutical product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that any potential product candidate will fail to demonstrate adequate effectiveness in the targeted indication or an acceptable safety profile, gain regulatory approval and become commercially viable. We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue to date, and we continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. As a result, we are not profitable and have incurred net losses since our inception in January 2020. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we reported net losses of 24.5 million, 61.3 million, 12.9 million and 39.4 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 201.9 million. 
 
 We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect these losses to increase as we: 
 continue to invest in our research and development activities, including conducting preclinical and clinical studies and hiring additional personnel to support the conduct of those studies; 

submit Investigational New Drug applications (INDs) and conduct clinical trials for our current and future product candidates; 

operate as a public company and hire additional personnel and build our internal resources in related areas, including those related to audit, patent, other legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirements, and incur costs related to director and officer insurance premiums and investor and public relations; 

obtain, expand, maintain, enforce and protect our intellectual property portfolio; 

seek marketing approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete the clinical trial process; and 

establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure and establish manufacturing capabilities, whether alone or with third parties, to commercialize product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval, if any. 

To become and remain profitable, we must succeed in developing and eventually commercializing products that generate significant revenue. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing clinical trials and preclinical studies of our product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval for these product candidates and manufacturing, marketing and selling any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. We are only in the preliminary stages for many of these activities. We may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, may never generate revenues that are significant enough to achieve profitability. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenue. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with biopharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts, diversify our product candidates or even continue our operations. Our prior net losses and expected future net losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders equity and working capital. A decline in the value of our company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment. 
 
 We will need substantial additional capital to finance our operations, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. The effects of macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical events, including political elections, economic slowdowns, recessions, inflation, high interest rates, bank failures and tightening of credit markets, the conflicts in Ukraine, the Middle East or elsewhere, or otherwise, may limit our access to capital. Failure to obtain or have access to this necessary capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate certain of our product development efforts or other operations. 
 
 We expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing and planned activities, particularly as we continue to develop our product candidates in preclinical studies and clinical trials and expand our organization by hiring additional personnel. Our expenses will increase substantially if, as is the case with bexicaserin, our product candidates successfully complete early clinical and other studies. Our expenses also could increase beyond expectations if the FDA or other regulatory authorities require us to perform clinical and other studies in addition to those that we currently anticipate. In addition, we have incurred and 
 33 

expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. Furthermore, in connection with planning for the possibility that we may receive marketing approval in the future for our product candidates that are in later stages of clinical development, and thereafter if we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates, we expect to incur significant and increasing expenses related to manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were 288.4 million. In January 2024, we completed a public offering of common stock and received gross proceeds of 241.5 million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. In March 2024, we completed a private placement of non-voting common stock and received net proceeds of 59.8 million. We believe, based on our current operating plan, that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. However, our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity or debt financings, third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements, as well as other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements, or any combination of these approaches. 
 
 In any event, we will require substantial additional capital to support our business operations as we pursue additional preclinical and clinical activities and regulatory approval of our current or any future product candidates, and otherwise to support our continuing operations. Even if we believe we have sufficient capital for our current or future operating plans, we may seek additional capital if market conditions are favorable or if we have specific strategic considerations. Any additional capital raising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and, if approved, commercialize our current and any future product candidates. 
 
 Additional funding may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Adverse geopolitical and macroeconomic developments, such as political elections, a health epidemic or pandemic, geopolitical conflicts (including in Ukraine and the Middle East) and related sanctions, global supply chain challenges, high inflation and the responses by central banking authorities to control inflation, have previously caused, and may in the future cause, the global credit and financial markets to experience extreme volatility and disruptions, diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, bank failures, increases in unemployment rates, and uncertainty regarding economic stability. If the equity and credit markets deteriorate or are otherwise not favorable, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult, more costly or more dilutive. If we do not raise additional capital in sufficient amounts, we may be prevented from pursuing development and commercialization efforts, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 
 
 In March 2023, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the FDIC as receiver. Subsequently, the U.S. Treasury, Federal Reserve and FDIC announced that SVB depositors would have access to all of their money, and SVB was then acquired by First Citizens Bank. We have a banking relationship with SVB and hold a small amount of cash in SVB depository accounts to cover short-term operational payments. While we have not experienced any losses in such accounts, the failure of SVB caused us to utilize and establish additional accounts at other financial institutions in order to mitigate potential operational risks stemming from the temporary inability to access funds in our SVB operating accounts. Bank failures such as SVB s could significantly impair our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our current and projected future business operations and could negatively impact the financial institutions with which we have direct arrangements, or the financial services industry or economy in general. 
 
 Raising additional capital or acquiring or licensing assets by issuing equity or debt securities may cause dilution to our stockholders and raising funds through lending and licensing arrangements may restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights. 
 
 We may seek additional capital through a combination of public and private equity offerings, debt financings, strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could involve certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. If we raise additional capital through future collaborations, strategic alliances or third-party licensing arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our intellectual property, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. 
 
 If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise develop and market ourselves. 
 
 34 

Unfavorable geopolitical and macroeconomic developments could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 From time to time we may maintain a portfolio of investments in marketable debt securities, which are recorded at fair value. Although we have established investment guidelines relative to diversification and maturity with the objectives of maintaining safety of principal and liquidity, we rely on credit rating agencies to help evaluate the riskiness of investments, and such agencies may not accurately predict such risk. In addition, such agencies may reduce the credit quality of our individual holdings, which could adversely affect their value. Lower credit quality and other market events, such as changes in interest rates and deterioration in credit markets, may have an adverse effect on the fair value of our investment holdings and cash position. 
 
 Our business could be adversely affected by conditions in the U.S. and global economies, the United States and global financial markets and adverse geopolitical and macroeconomic developments, including political elections, high inflation, the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East and related sanctions, bank failures, and economic uncertainties related to these conditions. 
 
 Risks Related to the Development and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates 
 
 All of our product candidates are in the research and development stage; our product candidates may not be approved by any regulatory authority for marketing. If we are unable to advance our product candidates in clinical development, obtain regulatory approval and ultimately commercialize our product candidates, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed. 
 
 All of our product candidates are in the research and development stage. Our ability to generate product revenues, which we do not expect will occur for many years, if ever, will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of our product candidates. 
 
 Our most advanced product candidates, bexicaserin and LP659, are in the clinical testing phase of development. In the first quarter of 2024, we announced topline results from the PACIFIC Study, a Phase 1b/2a clinical trial for bexicaserin, and in the third quarter of 2024 we initiated our global Phase 3 DEEp Program for bexicaserin. We have also conducted a Phase 1 single-ascending dose (SAD) clinical trial for our next most advanced product candidate, LP659. The FDA has placed the proposed Phase 1 multiple-ascending dose (MAD) study for LP659 on full clinical hold, and we are evaluating options for LP659 pending additional discussion with the FDA . All of our other development efforts are in the earlier research stage and we will need to progress them through IND-enabling studies and submit INDs to the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory agencies prior to initiating their clinical development. 
 
 The success of our product candidates will depend on several factors, including the following: 
 successful enrollment in clinical trials and completion of clinical trials and preclinical studies with favorable results; 

clearance of INDs by the FDA or similar regulatory filings by comparable foreign regulatory authorities for the conduct of clinical trials of our product candidates and our proposed design of future clinical trials, including dosing levels; 

demonstrating the safety and efficacy of our product candidates to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities; 

the effect of recent or potential health care legislation in the United States and European Union; 

receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities, including NDAs from the FDA and other regulatory authorities and maintaining such approvals; 

making arrangements with third-party manufacturers for, or establishing, clinical and commercial manufacturing capabilities; 

establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities and launching commercial sales of our products, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; 

establishing and maintaining of patent and trade secret protection or regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates; 

our ongoing relationship with Pfizer, the parent company of Arena, from whom we license product candidates including bexicaserin and LP659; 

maintaining an acceptable safety profile of our products following approval; 

the availability of adequate reimbursement for our products following approval; 

acceptance by physicians, payors and patients of the benefits, safety and efficacy of our products following approval; and 

35 

building and maintaining an organization of people who can successfully develop, sell and distribute our product candidates. 

The success of our business, including our ability to finance our company and generate any revenue in the future, will primarily depend on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our most advanced product candidate, bexicaserin, as well as our other product candidates, which may never occur. While we have announced topline safety and efficacy data from a Phase 1b/2a clinical trial, the PACIFIC Study, and subsequently received Breakthrough Therapy designation for bexicaserin, we have not yet demonstrated efficacy and safety sufficient for obtaining marketing approval for bexicaserin or for any other product candidate. Given our product candidates stage of development, it could take several years before we can demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a treatment sufficient to warrant approval for commercialization, if we can do so at all. If we are unable to develop, or obtain regulatory approval for, or, if approved, successfully commercialize our product candidates, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to continue our business. 
 
 Risks associated with the in-licensing or acquisition of product candidates could cause substantial delays in the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates. 
 
 Prior to October 2020, we had no involvement with or control over the preclinical and early clinical research and development of our product candidates. We have relied on third parties, including Arena, to have conducted such research and development in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards prior to the in-licensing of our product candidates. If the research and development processes or the results of the development programs prior to the in-licensing of our product candidates prove to be unreliable, this could result in increased costs and delays in the development of our product candidates, which could adversely affect any future revenue from these product candidates. 
 
 We have licensed product candidates, including bexicaserin and LP659, from Arena, which has been acquired by Pfizer. The fields of the licenses for certain of these product candidates contain restrictions. For example, the field of license for LP659 is for developmental, degenerative and autoimmune disease, disorders or conditions of the CNS or peripheral nervous system. We also rely on Arena to help protect the intellectual property rights relating to our licensed product candidates. The scope of our license or Arena s failure to cooperate with us to protect our intellectual property could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop our product candidates and could limit our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates. 
 
 We may also acquire or in-license additional product candidates for preclinical or clinical development in the future as we continue to build our pipeline. The risks associated with acquiring or in-licensing current or future product candidates could result in delays in the commencement or completion of our research and development, prevent or impede our commercialization, and adversely affect or delay our ability to generate revenues from our product candidates. 
 
 Clinical and preclinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome. The results of prior clinical trials and preclinical studies of our product candidates are not necessarily predictive of future results. 
 
 Before we can initiate clinical trials for our product candidates, we must submit the results of preclinical studies to the FDA, European Medicines Agency (EMA) or comparable regulatory authorities along with other information, including information about product candidate chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and our proposed clinical trial protocol, as part of an IND or similar regulatory filing. Before obtaining marketing approval from the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities for the sale of our product candidates, we must complete preclinical development and extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates. Clinical and preclinical drug development is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Our clinical trials may not be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all, and failure can occur at any time during the preclinical study or clinical trial process. Despite promising preclinical or clinical results, any product candidate can unexpectedly fail at any stage of preclinical or clinical development. The historical failure rate for product candidates in our industry is high. The results from preclinical studies or early clinical trials of a product candidate may not predict the results of later clinical trials of the product candidate, and interim results of a clinical trial are not necessarily indicative of final results. Furthermore, product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy characteristics despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. 
 
 In particular, while we announced positive topline results from the Phase 1b/2a PACIFIC Study for bexicaserin in the first quarter of 2024, we do not know how bexicaserin will perform in any current or future clinical trials, including our Phase 3 program. It is not uncommon to observe results in clinical trials that are unexpected based on preclinical studies and earlier clinical trials, and many product candidates fail in clinical trials despite very promising early results. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data may be susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in clinical development even after achieving promising results in earlier studies, or after others, including regulatory authorities, disagreed with such companies views and interpretations of the data and results from earlier preclinical studies 
 36 

or clinical trials. As we investigate our product candidates, we may encounter difficulties that we have not yet encountered. For example, bexicaserin has to date been studied in a population of ages 12 to 65, and for our global Phase 3 program, we utilized PK modeling to determine appropriate dosing for participants ages 2 to 11. This work is ongoing and we may encounter unforeseen difficulties. Furthermore, we have conducted a Phase 1 SAD clinical trial for LP659 in healthy volunteers and we submitted safety data from the SAD study and other related information to the FDA, along with a proposed protocol for a MAD study, to seek to address a partial clinical hold on MAD or other repeat dose studies of LP659. The FDA placed a full clinical hold on the proposed MAD study for LP659. We are evaluating our options for LP659 pending additional discussion with the FDA. For these and other reasons, we may not initiate or complete planned or ongoing clinical studies for our current or future product candidates in the time or manner we desire, or at all. 
 
 Events that may prevent successful or timely completion of clinical development include: 
 delays in reaching, or inability to reach, a consensus with regulatory authorities on trial design or implementation; 

delays in obtaining regulatory authorization to commence a trial as proposed or at all; 

the FDA s, EMA s or comparable regulatory authorities failure to accept our proposed manufacturing processes and suppliers and/or requirement to provide additional information regarding our manufacturing processes before providing marketing authorization; 

delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical research organizations (CROs) and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites; 

delays in obtaining approval from one or more institutional review boards (IRBs), or IRBs refusing to approve, suspending or terminating the trial at an investigational site, precluding enrollment of additional participants, or withdrawing their approval of the trial; 

delays in recruiting suitable participants to participate in our ongoing and planned clinical trials; 

changes to the clinical trial protocol; 

clinical sites deviating from trial protocol or dropping out of a trial; 

delays in manufacturing sufficient quantities of our product candidates or obtaining sufficient quantities of combination therapies for use in clinical trials; 

delays in having participants complete participation in a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up; 

participants choosing an alternative treatment for the indication for which we are developing our product candidates, or participating in competing clinical trials; 

lack of adequate funding to continue a trial; 

occurrence of adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs) associated with the product candidate that are viewed to outweigh its potential benefits; 

occurrence of SAEs in trials of the same class of agents conducted by other companies; 

selection of clinical end points that require prolonged periods of clinical observation or analysis of the resulting data; 

a facility manufacturing our product candidates or any of their components being ordered by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to temporarily or permanently shut down due to violations of current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) regulations or other applicable requirements, or infections or cross-contaminations of product candidates in the manufacturing process; 

third-party clinical investigators losing the licenses or permits necessary to perform our clinical trials, not performing our clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol or good clinical practices (GCP) or other regulatory requirements; 

the impact of geopolitical and macroeconomic developments, including legislation (such as the Biosecure Act), ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and related economic instability and uncertainty, on our ongoing and planned clinical trials; or 

changes in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols. 

37 

We could encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended, terminated or modified by us, by the IRBs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, by a Data Safety Monitoring Board for such trial or by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Such authorities may impose such a suspension or termination due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. In addition, changes in regulatory requirements and policies may occur, and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to comply with these changes. Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to IRBs for reexamination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial. 
 
 Further, conducting clinical trials in foreign countries, as we may do for our product candidates, presents additional risks that may delay completion of our clinical trials. These risks include the failure of enrolled participants in foreign countries to adhere to clinical protocol as a result of differences in healthcare services or cultural customs, managing additional administrative burdens associated with foreign regulatory schemes, as well as political, economic and legal risks relevant to such foreign countries. 
 
 In addition, adverse geopolitical and macroeconomic developments, including disruptions caused by a pandemic or the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, may increase the likelihood that we encounter difficulties or delays in initiating, screening, enrolling, conducting, or completing our ongoing and planned preclinical studies and clinical trials. Clinical site initiation and participant screening and enrollment may be delayed due to prioritization of hospital resources toward a pandemic, or to the extent the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East escalate to involve additional countries, further economic sanctions or wider military conflict impacting regions where we conduct clinical trials. Investigators and participants may not be able to comply with clinical trial protocols if quarantines impede participant movement or interrupt healthcare services. Similarly, our ability to recruit and retain participants and principal investigators and site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to pathogens, could be limited, which in turn could adversely impact our clinical trial operations. Additionally, we may experience interruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site monitoring, due to limitations on travel, quarantines or social distancing protocols imposed or recommended by federal or state governments, employers and others in connection with a health epidemic or pandemic. 
 
 Any inability to successfully complete preclinical and clinical development could result in additional costs to us or impair our ability to generate revenue from future product sales and regulatory and commercialization milestones. In addition, if we make manufacturing or formulation changes to our product candidates, we may need to conduct additional testing to bridge our modified product candidate to earlier versions. Clinical trial delays could also shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates, if approved, or allow our competitors to bring comparable products to market before we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 
 We have limited experience as a company in conducting clinical trials, have never conducted later-stage clinical trials or submitted an NDA or other marketing application, and may be unable to do so for any of our product candidates. 
 
 Our product candidates are still in the research and development stage, and we will need to successfully complete clinical trials, including lengthy later-stage and pivotal clinical trials in order to obtain FDA or comparable foreign regulatory approval to market bexicaserin, LP659, or any future product candidates. Carrying out clinical trials and the submission of marketing applications is complicated and time consuming. To date, we have only completed a limited number of Phase 1 and one Phase 1b/2a clinical trials for one of our product candidates, bexicaserin, and one Phase 1 SAD clinical trial for another of our product candidates, LP659. We have not completed any clinical trials of any other product candidates, have not completed any later-stage or pivotal clinical trials, have limited experience as a company in preparing, submitting and prosecuting regulatory filings and have not previously submitted an NDA or other comparable foreign regulatory submission for any product candidate. We also plan to conduct a number of clinical trials for multiple product candidates in parallel over the next several years. This may be a difficult process to manage with our limited resources and may divert the attention of management. In addition, we cannot be certain how many clinical trials of our product candidates will be required, how such trials will have to be designed, how the FDA and all other relevant regulatory health authorities will view any trial s design, or whether these regulators will view the data from such trial as favorable. Consequently, we may be unable to successfully and efficiently execute and complete necessary clinical trials in a way that leads to regulatory submission and approval of any of our product candidates. We may require more time and incur greater costs than our competitors and may not succeed in obtaining regulatory approvals of product candidates that we develop. Failure to commence or complete, or delays in, our planned clinical trials, could prevent us from or delay us in submitting marketing applications for and commercializing our product candidates. 
 
 38 

Because we have multiple product candidates in our pipeline and are considering a variety of target indications, we may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success. 
 
 Because we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on specific product candidates, indications and development programs. We may also conduct several clinical trials for our product candidates in parallel over the next several years, which may make our decision as to which product candidates to focus on more difficult. For example, we are currently conducting a global Phase 3 program for bexicaserin, and we may conduct a Phase 1 MAD clinical trial for LP659 subject to discussions with the FDA to address a full clinical hold. In addition, we have earlier-stage research efforts ongoing. As a result, we may forgo or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or other indications that could have had greater commercial potential or likelihood of success. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. In addition, if we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through future collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate. 
 
 Enrollment and retention of participants in clinical trials is an expensive and time-consuming process and could be made more difficult or rendered impossible by multiple factors outside our control. 
 
 Participant enrollment is a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, and the timing of our clinical trials depends, in part, on the speed at which we can recruit participants to participate in our trials, as well as completion of required follow-up periods. Participant enrollment and retention in clinical trials depends on many factors, including the size and nature of the patient population, the severity of the disease under investigation, the nature of the trial protocol, the existing body of safety and efficacy data for the product candidate, the number and nature of competing treatments and ongoing clinical trials of competing therapies for the same indication, the proximity of participants to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the ability to adequately monitor participants during a trial, clinicians and participants perceptions as to the potential advantages of the product candidate being studied, and the risk that participants will drop out of a trial before completing all site visits. There are limited patient pools from which to draw in order to complete our clinical trials in a timely and cost-effective manner, including due to the fact that the neurological diseases we target are rare. 
 
 We may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible participants to participate in these trials to such trial s conclusion as required by the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Additionally, certain clinical trials for our future product candidates may be focused on indications with relatively small patient populations, which may further limit enrollment of eligible participants or may result in slower enrollment than we anticipate. The eligibility criteria of our clinical trials, once established, may further limit the pool of available trial participants. For example, the number of patients suffering from DEEs, such as Dravet syndrome, LGS and TSC, is small and, in some cases, has not been established with precision. If the actual number of patients with these diseases is smaller than we anticipate, we may encounter difficulties in enrolling participants in our clinical trials or retaining them to complete our clinical trials, thereby delaying or preventing development and approval of our product candidates. 
 
 Furthermore, a number of factors could delay or prevent potential participants from participating in our clinical trials. For example, our efforts to build relationships with patient communities may not succeed, which could result in delays in participant enrollment in our clinical trials. Similarly, the escalation of the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East to involve additional countries, further economic sanctions or wider military conflict could delay participant enrollment in our clinical trials. In addition, any negative results we may report in clinical trials of a product candidate may make it difficult or impossible to recruit and retain participants in other clinical trials of that same product candidate. Delays or failures in planned participant enrollment or retention may result in increased costs, program delays or both, which could have a harmful effect on our ability to develop our product candidates, or could render further development impossible. In addition, natural disasters or public health epidemics may delay or prevent participants from enrolling or from receiving treatment in accordance with the protocol and the required timelines, which could delay our clinical trials, or prevent us or our partners from completing our clinical trials at all, and harm our ability to obtain approval for such product candidate. Further, if participants drop out of our clinical trials, miss scheduled doses or follow-up visits, or otherwise fail to follow clinical trial protocols, the integrity of data from our clinical trials may be compromised or not accepted by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, which would represent a significant setback for the applicable program. In addition, we may rely on CROs and clinical trial sites to ensure proper and timely conduct of our future clinical trials and, while we intend to enter into agreements governing their services, we will be limited in our ability to compel their actual performance. 
 
 39 

Preliminary, topline and interim data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more participant data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data. 
 
 From time to time, we may publicly disclose preliminary or topline data from our clinical trials, such as our announcement in the first quarter of 2024 of topline data from the Phase 1b/2a PACIFIC Study for bexicaserin for the treatment of seizures associated with DEEs. These disclosures are based on a preliminary analysis of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. As a result, the topline results that we report may differ from future results of the same studies, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results, once additional data have been received and fully evaluated. Topline data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, topline data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. As an example, in March 2024, following our review of the full data set for the Phase 1b/2a PACIFIC Study, we announced an update to the previously reported primary efficacy endpoint data. From time to time, we may also disclose interim data from our clinical studies. For example, in June 2024 we announced interim data from the open-label extension (OLE) of the PACIFIC Study. Interim data from clinical trials are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as participant enrollment continues or as more participant data become available. Adverse differences between preliminary or interim data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects. 
 
 Further, others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimates, calculations, conclusions or analyses or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could impact the value of the particular program, the approvability or commercialization of the particular product candidate or product and our company in general. In addition, the information we choose to publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is based on what is typically extensive information, and you or others may not agree with what we determine is the material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure, and any information we determine not to disclose may ultimately be deemed significant with respect to future decisions, conclusions, views, activities or otherwise regarding a particular product, product candidate or our business. If the topline data that we report differ from actual results, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions we reach, our ability to obtain approval for, and commercialize, our product candidates may be harmed, which could harm our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition. 
 
 Our product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial potential or result in significant negative consequences following any potential marketing approval. 
 
 During the conduct of clinical trials, participants report changes in their health, including illnesses, injuries and discomforts, to their doctor. These conditions may also be observed in preclinical animal studies. Often, it is not possible to determine whether or not the product candidate being studied caused these conditions. Regulatory authorities may draw different conclusions or require additional testing to confirm these determinations, if they occur. 
 
 In addition, it is possible that as we test our product candidates in larger, longer and more extensive clinical programs, or as use of these product candidates becomes more widespread if they receive regulatory approval, illnesses, injuries, discomforts and other AEs that were observed in earlier trials, as well as conditions that did not occur or went undetected in previous trials, will be reported by participants. Many times, side effects are only detectable after investigational product candidates are tested in large-scale, Phase 3 trials or, in some cases, after they are made available to participants on a commercial scale after approval. Participants in our ongoing or planned clinical trials may experience similar or other side effects after treatment with one or more of our product candidates. If additional clinical experience indicates that any of our current product candidates and any future product candidates has serious or life-threatening side effects or other side effects that outweigh the potential therapeutic benefit, the development of the product candidate may fail or be delayed, or, if the product candidate has received regulatory approval, such approval may be revoked, which would harm our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. 
 
 Moreover, if we elect, or are required, to delay, suspend or terminate any clinical trial of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate revenue through their sale may be delayed or eliminated. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. 
 
 Bexicaserin, our most advanced product candidate, is an oral, centrally acting, 5-HT2C receptor superagonist with no observed impact on 5-HT2B and 5-HT2A receptor subtypes in our preclinical studies to date. 5-HT2B and 5-HT2A receptor subtypes have been known to be associated with significant adverse side effects, including valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension in the case of the 5-HT2B receptor, and hallucinations and mild to severe anxiety in the case of the 5-HT2A receptor. Bexicaserin has the potential to be a clinically differentiated 5-HT2C superagonist for patients with DEEs. For example, fenfluramine, marketed as 
 40 

FINTEPLA, a non-specific 5-HT2 agonist, was approved for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome and LGS by the FDA in 2020 and 2022, respectively. Fenfluramine has been associated with significant side effects and FINTEPLA has a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program requirement and a boxed warning. Another 5-HT2C agonist, lorcaserin, is also under evaluation for its potential to reduce seizures in patients with Dravet syndrome and refractory epilepsies. Lorcaserin was discovered by Arena and approved by the FDA for chronic weight management, marketed as BELVIQ by Eisai Inc. Lorcaserin was withdrawn from the market at the request of the FDA following the FDA s analysis of the CAMELLIA-TIMI 61 clinical trial, for which participants in the lorcaserin group demonstrated a numerically higher but not a statistically significantly higher rate of total cancer diagnoses (7.7 vs 7.1 placebo). Based on the results of this clinical trial, the FDA concluded that the risks of lorcaserin outweigh the benefits for the approved indication of weight management and requested that lorcaserin be withdrawn from the market. However, the FDA authorized an expanded access program for patients with Dravet syndrome to continue to receive lorcaserin. Bexicaserin was designed and developed by Arena to be the next generation to lorcaserin, with the goal of being a safer and more effective 5-HT2C agonist. We believe bexicaserin s potential for high selectivity and novel chemistry gives it the potential to reduce seizures in DEE patients and overcome the known or perceived safety limitations of available drugs in the 5-HT2 class. However, we may not be correct, and the selectivity, specificity or other attributes of bexicaserin may result in similar or less desirable clinical profiles than less selective and specific available drugs or other product candidates. 
 
 In addition, if any of our product candidates receive marketing approval, the FDA could require us to include a black box or other warning, or contraindication, in our product labeling, or adopt REMS to ensure that the benefits outweigh its risks, which may include, among other things, a medication guide outlining the risks of the drug for distribution to patients and a communication plan to health care practitioners. Furthermore, if we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by our product candidates or other products with the same or related active ingredients, several other potentially significant negative consequences could result, including: 
 regulatory authorities may suspend or withdraw approvals of such product, if approved; 

regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label or issue safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; 

we may be required to change the way a product candidate is administered, conduct additional clinical trials or modify such product in some other way; 

regulatory authorities may require us to modify, suspend or terminate our clinical trials, conduct additional clinical trials or engage in costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of such product; 

we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; 

undesirable side effects may limit physicians or patients willingness to initiate or continue therapy with such product; 

sales may decrease significantly; 

we may need to conduct a recall; and 

our brand and reputation or the reputation of any then-approved product may suffer. 

Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of our product candidates and could significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 If the market opportunities for our product candidates are smaller than we estimate, even assuming approval of a product candidate, our business may suffer. Because the patient populations in the market for our product candidates may be small, we must be able to successfully identify patients and acquire a significant market share to achieve profitability and growth. 
 
 If the size of the market opportunities in each of our target indications is smaller than we anticipate, we may not be able to achieve profitability and growth. We focus on developing novel medicines for neurological diseases. Given the small number of patients who have the diseases that we are targeting, our eligible patient population and pricing estimates may differ significantly from the actual market addressable by our product candidates. Our projections of both the number of people who have these diseases, as well as the subset of people with these diseases who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our product candidates, are based on estimates that have been derived from a variety of sources, including scientific literature, patient foundations, or market research, and which may prove to be incorrect. Further, new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these diseases. The number of patients may turn out to be lower than expected. Likewise, the potentially addressable patient population for each of our product candidates may be limited or may not be amenable to treatment with our product candidates, and new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to, which would adversely affect our results of operations and our business. 
 
 41 

We face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than us. 
 
 The development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to our current product candidates and will face competition with respect to any other product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. There are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of product candidates for the treatment of the indications that we are pursuing. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. 
 
 DEEs are commonly treated with multiple combinations of ASMs though physician preference for administered therapies differs across different epilepsy types. Pharmaceutical companies such as Jazz, UCB, SK Life Sciences, Marinus Pharmaceuticals and Biocodex have approved ASMs for the treatment of epilepsies. There are also non-pharmaceutical therapies for epilepsy patients, such as a ketogenic diet, vagus nerve stimulation, and surgery for some patients. Several companies have obtained FDA approval for the treatment of seizures associated with DEEs. For example, ZTALMY (ganaxolone) was approved for the treatment of seizures associated with CDKL5 deficiency disorder in March 2022. Fenfluramine was approved for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in June 2020 and LGS in March 2022 and is available for patients through a REMS program. Epidiolex (cannabidiol) was approved for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome and LGS in 2018, and for the treatment of seizures associated with TSC in 2020, and DIACOMIT (stiripentol) was approved for seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in 2018. In addition, other companies are developing therapeutics for the treatment of DEEs, including alternative approaches such as gene therapy. 
 
 In the S1P receptor modulator space, there are four drugs that have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of certain indications in multiple sclerosis: fingolimod, ozanimod, ponesimod and siponimod. There are multiple additional S1P receptor modulators in development for additional therapeutic indications beyond multiple sclerosis, including in other neurological diseases. There are also numerous other drugs and product candidates in development for indications for which we might develop our product candidates. 
 
 There are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of product candidates for the treatment of the indications that we are pursuing. More established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their substantially greater size, financial, technical and other resources, and institutional experience. In particular, these companies have greater experience and expertise in securing reimbursement, government contracts, relationships with key opinion leaders, conducting testing and clinical trials, obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals and distribution relationships to market products, and marketing approved drugs. These companies also have significantly larger research and development staff and experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations and well-established sales forces. If we are not able to compete effectively against existing and potential competitors, our business and financial condition may be harmed. 
 
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of our product candidates are likely to be their efficacy and safety, the scope and limitations of marketing approval, success of regulatory approval, successful protection of our intellectual property, and the availability of funding and reimbursement. 
 
 As a result of these factors, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their drugs before we are able to, which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop therapies that are safer, more effective, more widely accepted and cheaper than ours, and may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their drugs. These appreciable advantages could render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of such product candidates development and commercialization. 
 
 Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller and other early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and subject registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries.

The regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, our business will be substantially harmed. 
 
 The time required to obtain approval by the FDA and comparable foreign authorities is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. We have not obtained regulatory approval for any product candidate and it is possible that any product candidates we may seek to develop in the future will never obtain regulatory approval. Neither we nor any future collaborator is permitted to market any of our product candidates in the United States until we receive regulatory approval of an NDA from the FDA. 
 
 Prior to obtaining approval to commercialize a product candidate in the United States or abroad, we or our collaborators must demonstrate with substantial evidence from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies, that such product candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses. To demonstrate the safety of our clinical products, we may also be required to conduct extensive clinical trials and nonclinical studies, some of which have not been initiated or completed, and may not be completed for several years. For example, we believe that we will need to conduct additional nonclinical studies in juvenile animals, as well as develop a liquid formulation, to support the evaluation of bexicaserin in pediatric populations. We also expect that we will need to conduct additional toxicology, long-term carcinogenicity and other nonclinical studies to support the safety evaluation of bexicaserin and any of our product candidates intended to be administered for an extended period of time. There is no assurance our development or these studies will be successful. In addition, results from nonclinical studies and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways. Even if we believe the nonclinical or clinical data for our product candidates are promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. The FDA may also require us to conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials for our product candidates either prior to or post-approval, or it may object to elements of our clinical development program. For example, we submitted an IND for LP659 in 2023 and conducted a Phase 1 SAD clinical trial for LP659 in healthy volunteers. The FDA placed a full clinical hold on MAD or other repeat dose studies, however, and we may not be able to obtain the FDA s permission to proceed with repeat dose studies for LP659 in the manner we propose or at all. 
 
 The FDA or any foreign regulatory bodies can delay, limit or deny approval of our product candidates or require us to conduct additional nonclinical or clinical testing or abandon a program for a variety of reasons, including the following: 
 the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our preclinical studies or clinical trials; 

we may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for any of its proposed indications; 

the population studied in the clinical trial may not be sufficiently broad or representative to assure safety or demonstrate efficacy in the full population for which we seek approval; 

the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval; 

serious and unexpected drug-related side effects experienced by participants in our clinical trials or by individuals using drugs similar to our product candidates; 

we may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks; 

the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials; 

the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be acceptable or sufficient to support the submission of an NDA or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere, and we may be required to conduct additional clinical studies; 

the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree regarding the formulation, labeling and/or specifications of our product candidates; 

the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; and 

the approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our data insufficient for approval. 

43 

Any of the above events could prevent us from achieving marketing approval or market acceptance of our product candidates. These could also substantially increase the costs of commercializing our product candidates if they are approved. 
 
 Further, the FDA s or other ex-U.S. regulators policies may change, and legal or regulatory changes could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. For example, the U.S. Supreme Court recently reversed the Chevron deference doctrine, which gave deference to regulatory agencies such as the FDA in litigation against these agencies, and as a result more companies may bring lawsuits against the FDA to challenge longstanding decisions and policies of the FDA, which could undermine the FDA s authority, lead to uncertainties in the industry, and disrupt the FDA s normal operations, which could delay the FDA s review of our marketing applications or other submissions. 
 
 Of the large number of products in development, only a small percentage successfully complete FDA or foreign regulatory approval processes and are commercialized. The lengthy approval process as well as the unpredictability of future clinical trial results may result in our failing to obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates, which would significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 
 Receiving FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation for bexicaserin for the treatment of seizures associated with DEEs may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process for bexicaserin, and it does not mean bexicaserin will receive marketing approval. 
 
 In July 2024, we announced that the FDA granted us Breakthrough Therapy designation for bexicaserin for the treatment of seizures associated with DEEs for patients two years of age or older. FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation is a process designed to expedite the development and regulatory review of drugs that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate a substantial improvement over available therapy on at least one clinically significant endpoint. A drug that has been designated as a Breakthrough Therapy is eligible for more intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program and organization commitment involving senior managers from the FDA. A drug designated as a Breakthrough Therapy by the FDA may also be eligible for priority review and accelerated approval. 
 
 Receipt of Breakthrough Therapy designation for bexicaserin may not result in a faster development process, review or approval than under conventional FDA procedures, and it does not assure ultimate marketing approval by the FDA for the treatment of seizures associated with DEEs or for any other indication. The clinical evidence supporting Breakthrough Therapy designation for a product candidate is preliminary, and the standard for Breakthrough Therapy designation is not the same as the standard for marketing approval. In addition, even if a product candidate qualifies as a Breakthrough Therapy, the FDA may later decide that such product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification. 
 
 Even if our current or future product candidates receive marketing approval, they may fail to achieve market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors or others in the medical community necessary for commercial success. 
 
 Even if our current or future product candidates receive marketing approval, they may fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. If they do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenue and may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of our current or future product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to: 
 patient demand; 

the clinical indications for which the product candidate is approved; 

the efficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments and therapies; 

the timing of market introduction of the product as well as competitive products; 

effectiveness of our sales, marketing and distribution efforts and those of the third parties with whom we may contract; 

the strength of our relationships with patient communities; 

the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments and therapies, including any similar generic treatments; 

our ability to offer such product for sale at competitive prices; 

the convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments and therapies; 

the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies; 

the strength of marketing and distribution support; 

44 

the availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement; 

the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors and government authorities; 

potential product liability claims; 

relative convenience and ease of administration, including as compared to alternative treatments and competitive therapies, and patient satisfaction with the overall treatment experience; 

the prevalence and severity of any side effects from the use or potential misuse of any then-approved product or any similar product candidate in development, whether ours or a competitor and 

any restrictions on the use of the product together with other medications. 

Our efforts to educate physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful. Such efforts may require more resources than are typically required due to the complexity and uniqueness of our product candidates. 
 
 In addition, if approved, bexicaserin may face challenges in gaining market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors or others in the medical community as a result of it being a 5-HT2C agonist, which is part of an agonist class associated with significant risks and side effects. For example, fenfluramine, marketed as FINTEPLA, is a non-specific 5-HT2 agonist, has been associated with significant side effects and FINTEPLA has a REMS program requirement and a boxed warning. Another 5-HT2C agonist, lorcaserin, is also under evaluation for its potential to reduce seizures in patients with Dravet syndrome and refractory epilepsies. Lorcaserin was discovered by Arena and approved by the FDA for chronic weight management, marketed as BELVIQ by Eisai Inc. and withdrawn from the market at the request of the FDA based on a change in the FDA s risk-benefit assessment for the approved indication. However, the FDA authorized an expanded access program for patients with Dravet syndrome to continue to receive lorcaserin. 
 
 Although we aim to improve upon current 5-HT2C agonist product profiles with bexicaserin, which was designed to be the next generation to lorcaserin with the goal of being a safer and more effective 5-HT2C agonist, and which we believe has the potential to overcome the limitations of the currently available 5-HT2 class, if we are unable to do so and to educate physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community about this product candidate and successfully distinguish the safety profile of this product candidate as compared to those of other products in the 5-HT2C agonist class, we may fail to gain market acceptance of bexicaserin. 
 
 Because we expect sales of our product candidates, if approved, to generate substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future, the failure of our product candidates, if approved, to find market acceptance would harm our business and could require us to seek additional financing. 
 
 Even if we obtain regulatory approval for our current or future product candidates, they will remain subject to ongoing regulatory oversight. 
 
 Even if we obtain any regulatory approval for our current or any future product candidates, such approvals will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements for manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, import, export, sampling, record-keeping and submission of safety and other post-market information. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as ongoing compliance with cGMPs and GCPs for any clinical trials that we may conduct post-approval. Any regulatory approvals that we receive for our current or future product candidates may also be subject to a REMS, limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the drug may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 trials, and surveillance to monitor the quality, safety and efficacy of the drug. 
 
 In addition, drug manufacturers and their facilities are subject to payment of user fees and continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP requirements and adherence to commitments made in the NDA or foreign marketing application. If we, or a regulatory authority, discover previously unknown problems with a drug, such as AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the drug is manufactured, or if a regulatory authority disagrees with the promotion, marketing or labeling of that drug, a regulatory authority may impose restrictions relative to that drug, the manufacturing facility or us, including requesting a recall or requiring withdrawal of the drug from the market or suspension of manufacturing. 
 
 45 

If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements following approval of our current or future product candidates, a regulatory authority may: 
 issue an untitled letter or warning letter asserting that we are in violation of the law; 

seek an injunction or impose administrative, civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines; 

suspend or withdraw regulatory approval; 

suspend any ongoing clinical trials; 

refuse to approve a pending NDA or NDA supplement, or comparable foreign marketing application (or any supplements thereto) submitted by us or our strategic partners; 

restrict or suspend the marketing or manufacturing of the drug; 

seize or detain the drug or otherwise require the withdrawal of the drug from the market; 

refuse to permit the import or export of the drug; or 

refuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. 

Any government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity. The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our current or future product candidates and harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 
 In addition, the FDA s policies, and those of equivalent foreign regulatory agencies, may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could cause changes to or delays in the drug review process, or suspend or restrict regulatory approval of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 
 We currently have a limited number of personnel with marketing and sales experience and have no experience as a company in commercializing products, and we may have to invest significant resources to develop these capabilities. If we are unable to establish adequate marketing and sales capabilities or agreements with third parties to market and sell our products, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products. 
 
 We have not as a company commercialized a product and have limited internal sales, marketing or distribution capabilities. If any of our product candidates ultimately receives regulatory approval, we must build a marketing and sales organization with technical expertise and supporting distribution capabilities to commercialize each such product in the markets that we target, which will be expensive and time consuming, or collaborate with third parties that have direct sales forces and established distribution systems, either to augment our own sales force and distribution systems or in lieu of our own sales force and distribution systems. We currently plan to independently commercialize our product candidates in the United States by establishing a focused sales force and marketing infrastructure. We may opportunistically seek additional strategic collaborations to maximize the commercial opportunities for our product candidates outside of the United States. There are significant risks involved in building and managing a sales organization, including our ability to hire, retain and incentivize qualified individuals, generate sufficient sales leads, provide adequate training to sales and marketing personnel and effectively manage a geographically dispersed sales and marketing team. Any failure or delay in the development of our internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities would adversely impact the commercialization of these products. We may not be able to enter into collaborations or hire consultants or external service providers to assist us in sales, marketing and distribution functions on acceptable financial terms, or at all. In addition, our product revenues and our profitability, if any, may be lower if we rely on third parties for these functions than if we were to market, sell and distribute any products that we develop ourselves. We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively. If we are not successful in commercializing our products, either on our own or through arrangements with one or more third parties, we may not be able to generate any future product revenue and we would incur significant additional losses. 
 
 Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in one jurisdiction does not mean that we will be successful in obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in other jurisdictions. 
 
 Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in one jurisdiction does not guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain regulatory approval in any other jurisdiction. For example, even if the FDA grants regulatory approval of a 
 46 

product candidate, comparable regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions must also approve the manufacturing, marketing and promotion and reimbursement of the product candidate in those countries. However, a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory approval process in others. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from, and greater than, those in the United States, including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials as clinical trials conducted in one jurisdiction may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions outside the United States, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that jurisdiction. In some cases, the price that we intend to charge for our products is also subject to approval. 
 
 Obtaining foreign regulatory approvals and establishing and maintaining compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in certain countries. If we or any future collaborator fail to comply with the regulatory requirements in international markets or fail to receive applicable marketing approvals, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our product candidates will be harmed. 
 
 Product liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and could limit commercialization of any product candidate that we may develop. 
 
 We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our current and any future product candidates in clinical trials and may face an even greater risk if we commercialize any product candidate that we may develop. Any side effects, manufacturing defects, failure to follow instructions, misuse or abuse associated with our product candidates could result in injury to a patient or even death. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that any such product candidates caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities and could incur reputational harm. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in: 
 decreased demand for any product candidate that we may develop; 

product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions; 

loss of revenue; 

substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients that may not be covered by insurance; 

significant time and costs to defend the related litigation; 

a diversion of management s time and our resources; 

withdrawal of clinical trial participants and termination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs; 

initiation of investigations by regulators; 

the inability to commercialize any product candidate that we may develop; 

injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention; and 

a decline in our share price. 

Large judgments have been awarded in class action and individual lawsuits based on drugs that had anticipated or unanticipated side effects. Any product liability insurance coverage that we obtain and maintain may not be adequate to cover any or all liabilities that we may incur. We anticipate that we will need to increase our insurance coverage each time we commence a clinical trial and if we successfully commercialize any product candidate. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to obtain or maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise. 
 
 Our product candidates may be regulated as controlled substances, the making, use, sale, importation, exportation, and distribution of which are subject to significant regulation by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and other regulatory agencies. 
 
 Our product candidates may be classified as controlled substances, which are subject to state, federal, and foreign laws and regulations regarding their manufacture, use, sale, importation, exportation, and distribution. Among other things, controlled substances are regulated under the federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970 and regulations of the DEA. 
 
 The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no established medicinal use and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest 
 47 

relative risk of abuse among such substances. Prior to commercialization, centrally acting drugs are generally subject to review and potential scheduling by the DEA. It is possible that bexicaserin or our other product candidates may be regulated by the DEA as a Schedule IV controlled substance, which would subject such product candidates to additional restrictions regarding their manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use, depending on the scheduling of the active ingredients, and may limit the commercial potential of any of our product candidates, if approved. For example, lorcaserin is a Schedule IV controlled substance, and FINTEPLA was previously a Schedule IV controlled substance. 
 
 Various states also independently regulate controlled substances. Though state-controlled substances laws often mirror federal law, because the states are separate jurisdictions, they may separately schedule drugs as well. While some states automatically schedule a drug when the DEA does so, in other states there must be rulemaking or a legislative action. State scheduling may delay commercial sale of any controlled substance drug product for which we obtain federal regulatory approval and adverse scheduling could impair the commercial attractiveness of such product. We or our collaborators must also obtain separate state registrations in order to be able to obtain, handle and distribute controlled substances for clinical trials or commercial sale, and failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements could lead to enforcement and sanctions from the states in addition to those from the DEA or otherwise arising under federal law. 
 
 For any of our product candidates classified as controlled substances, we and our suppliers, manufacturers, contractors, customers and distributors are required to obtain and maintain applicable registrations from state, federal and foreign law enforcement and regulatory agencies and comply with state, federal and foreign laws and regulations regarding the manufacture, use, sale, importation, exportation and distribution of controlled substances. There is a risk that DEA regulations may limit the supply of the compounds used in clinical trials for our product candidates, and, in the future, the ability to produce and distribute our products in the volume needed to meet commercial demand. Regulations associated with controlled substances govern manufacturing, labeling, packaging, testing, dispensing, production and procurement quotas, recordkeeping, reporting, handling, shipment and disposal. These regulations increase the personnel needs and the expense associated with development and commercialization of product candidates including controlled substances. The DEA, and some states, conduct periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Failure to obtain and maintain required registrations or comply with any applicable regulations could delay or preclude us from developing and commercializing our product candidates containing controlled substances and subject us to enforcement action. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In some circumstances, violations could lead to criminal proceedings. Because of their restrictive nature, these regulations could limit commercialization of any of our product candidates that are classified as controlled substances. 
 
 Our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may be limited. 
 
 We have incurred substantial losses during our history, do not expect to become profitable in the near future and may never achieve profitability. To the extent that we continue to generate taxable losses, unused losses will, subject to limitations, carry forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until such unused losses expire (if at all). As of December 31, 2023, we had federal and California net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of 58.7 million and 1.6 million, respectively. 
 
 Our federal NOL carryforwards may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of these federal NOL carryforwards is limited to 80 of current year taxable income. Our California NOL carryforwards will begin to expire in 2040. Our NOL carryforwards are also subject to review and possible adjustment by the United States Internal Revenue Service and state tax authorities. 
 
 As of December 31, 2023, we also had federal and California research and development tax credit carryforwards, net of reserves, of 3.5 million and 1.2 million, respectively. Federal credit carryforwards will begin to expire after 2040 unless previously utilized. The California research and development credit carries forward indefinitely. 
 
 Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (IRC), our federal NOL carryforwards may become subject to an annual limitation in the event of certain cumulative changes in the ownership of our company. An ownership change pursuant to Section 382 of the IRC generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5 of a company s stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We may have experienced such ownership changes in the past, and we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of shifts in our stock ownership, some of which are outside our control. We have not conducted any studies to determine annual limitations, if any, that could result from such changes in the ownership of our stock. Our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards and certain other tax attributes could be limited by an ownership change as described above and consequently, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of our NOL carryforwards and certain other tax attributes, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations.

Risks Related to Regulatory Compliance 
 
 Our relationships with customers, healthcare providers, and third-party payors and/or the data we process may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, other healthcare laws and regulations and data privacy and security laws and regulations, contractual obligations and self-regulatory schemes. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties. 
 
 Healthcare providers, including physicians, and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third-party payors may subject us to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws and other healthcare laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal civil and criminal false claims laws and the law commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act and regulations. These laws will impact, among other things, our clinical research, as well as our proposed sales, marketing and educational programs. In addition, we process personal data and other sensitive and confidential information, which subjects us to various obligations related to data privacy and security, including laws at both the federal and state level. The laws that will affect our operations include, but are not limited to: 
 the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in return for the purchase, recommendation, leasing or furnishing of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to, among other things, arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand, and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation; 

federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including, without limitation, the False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalty laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval from Medicare, Medicaid or other government payors that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act; 

HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, a person from knowingly and willfully executing a scheme or making false or fraudulent statements to defraud any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private). Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation; 

HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH and their implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization by entities subject to the rule, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, known as covered entities, and their respective business associates, individuals or entities that perform certain services on behalf of a covered entity that involves the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information and their subcontractors that use, disclose or otherwise process individually identifiable health information; 

The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services (CMS), information related to: (i) payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors), physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants and certified nurse midwives, and teaching hospitals during the previous year; and (ii) ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; 

state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, state laws that require manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and/or information regarding drug pricing, state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or to adopt compliance programs as prescribed by state laws and regulations, or that otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers, state laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to drug pricing and marketing information, and state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and 

49 

federal, state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. By way of example, California enacted the CCPA, which gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal data sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal data is used, among other rights. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, including administrative fines of up to 7,500 per violation, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Other states, such as Virginia and Colorado, have also passed comprehensive privacy laws that provide individuals with certain rights with respect to their personal data, and similar laws are being considered in several other states, as well as at the federal and local levels. While the CCPA and other state comprehensive privacy laws exempt data subject to HIPAA and some data processed in the context of clinical trials, they apply to other data we maintain and may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Additionally, we are, or may become, subject to various U.S. federal and state consumer protection laws which require us to publish statements that accurately and fairly describe how we handle personal data and choices individuals may have about the way we handle their personal data. Outside the United States, an increasing number of laws, regulations, and industry standards govern data privacy and security. For example, the GDPR imposes obligations and restrictions on the collection and use of personal data relating to individuals in the European Economic Area (EEA) (including health data). The GDPR increases obligations with respect to clinical trials conducted in the EEA, including through its expansive the definition of personal data and because it requires changes to informed consent practices and more detailed notices for clinical trial participants and investigators. 

Importantly, the GDPR materially expands the definition of what constitutes personal data including by clarifying that the GDPR applies to pseudonymized (i.e. key-coded) data, which is often processed by sponsors in the context of clinical trials. EU and EEA Member States are also able to legislate separately on health and genetic data, and we must comply with these local laws where we operate. Also, notwithstanding the UK s withdrawal from the EU, the data protection obligations of the GDPR continue to apply to UK-related processing of personal data under the so-called UK GDPR . These GDPR regulations have extra-territorial reach for example they apply (inter-alia) to any processing of personal data that concerns the offering of goods or services to individuals in the EEA or UK (as applicable) and/or the monitoring of their behavior, regardless of the existence of an establishment in the EEA or UK (as applicable). These GDPR regulations also apply to any clinical trials and other operations taking place in the EEA and UK. The GDPR provides for robust regulatory enforcement and substantial fines. While the GDPR affords some flexibility in determining how to comply with the various requirements, significant effort and expense has been, and will continue to be, invested to ensure continuing compliance. In Switzerland, the Federal Act on Data Protection (DPA), also applies to the collection and processing of personal data, including health-related information, by companies located in Switzerland, or in certain circumstances, by companies located outside of Switzerland. The applicability of the DPA will also result in an increase of costs of compliance, risks of noncompliance and penalties for noncompliance. 
 
 Additionally, our employees and personnel may use generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to perform their work, and the disclosure and use of personal data in such technologies is subject to various privacy laws and other privacy obligations. Additionally, we may use AI to assist us in making certain decisions, which use is regulated by certain privacy laws. Governments have passed and are likely to pass additional laws regulating generative AI. Our use of this technology could result in additional compliance costs, regulatory investigations and actions, and lawsuits. For example, due to inaccuracies or flaws in the inputs, outputs, or logic of the AI, the model could be biased and could lead us to make decisions that could adversely affect us. If we are unable to use generative AI, it could make our business less efficient and result in competitive disadvantages. 
 
 These data privacy and security laws impose strict obligations on the ability to process personal data, including health-related information, in particular in relation to their collection, use, disclosure and transfer. This includes several requirements relating to (i) obtaining, in some situations, the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, (ii) the information provided to the individuals about how their personal data is used, (iii) ensuring the security and confidentiality of the personal data, (iv) the obligation to notify regulatory authorities and affected individuals of personal data breaches, (v) extensive internal privacy governance obligations, and (vi) obligations to honor rights of individuals in relation to their personal data (for example, the right to access, correct and delete their personal data). 
 
 In addition, we may be unable to transfer personal data from Europe and other jurisdictions to the United States or other countries due to data localization requirements or limitations on cross-border data flows. For example, the GDPR regulations significantly restrict the transfer of personal data from the EEA and the UK to the United States, and other countries in respect of which the European Commission or other relevant regulatory body has not issued a so-called adequacy decision (known as third countries ). Switzerland has adopted similar restrictions under the DPA. Although there are various mechanisms that may be used in some cases to lawfully transfer personal data to the U.S. or other countries, these mechanisms are subject to legal challenges and may not be available to us. Additionally, the implementation of these mechanisms, including through agreements with all relevant CROs, sub-processors and other third parties, is complex and time consuming. As such, transfers of personal data from the EEA, UK and/or 
 50 

Switzerland to the United States and other third countries may not fully comply with the cross-border data transfer restrictions set out in the applicable data privacy and security regulations. Additionally, other countries outside of Europe have enacted or are considering enacting similar cross-border data transfer restrictions and laws requiring local data residency, which could increase the cost and complexity of operating our business. 
 
 Compliance with U.S. and international data protection laws and regulations could require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to collect, use and disclose data, or in some cases, impact our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions. Furthermore, we are, or may become, subject to self-regulatory standards, contractual obligations and policies related to privacy and security. Actual or perceived failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include civil, criminal and administrative penalties), private litigation, and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business. Moreover, clinical trial participants, employees and other individuals about whom we or our potential collaborators obtain personal data, as well as the providers who share this information with us, may limit our ability to collect, use and disclose the information. Claims that we have violated individuals privacy rights, failed to comply with data protection laws, or breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business. 
 
 Particularly because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. 
 
 It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. 
 
 Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management s attention from the operation of our business. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements. The laws and regulations discussed in these risk factors are intended to be examples, and updates to these laws and regulations, as well as other laws and regulations, could have a material effect on our operations and prospects. 
 
 Coverage and adequate reimbursement may not be available for our current or any future product candidates, which could make it difficult for us to sell profitably, if approved. 
 
 Market acceptance and sales of any product candidates that we commercialize, if approved, will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these drugs and related treatments will be available from third-party payors, including government health administration authorities, managed care organizations and other private health insurers. Third-party payors decide which therapies they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies. However, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any product candidates that we develop will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. One third-party payor s determination to provide coverage for a drug does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage, and adequate reimbursement, for the drug. Additionally, a third-party payor s decision to provide coverage for a therapy does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Each third-party payor determines whether or not it will provide coverage for a therapy, what amount it will pay the manufacturer for the therapy, and on what tier of its formulary it will be placed. The position on a third-party payor s list of covered drugs, or formulary, generally determines the co-payment that a patient will need to make to obtain the therapy and can strongly influence the adoption of such therapy by patients and physicians. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers prescribing such services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our drugs unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our drugs. 
 
 A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications, requiring drug companies to provide them with varying levels of discounts from list prices and/or challenging the value of list prices charged for medical products. Similarly, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority for federal and state governments. Coverage and reimbursement may not be available for any drug that we commercialize and, if reimbursement 
 51 

is available, the level of reimbursement is uncertain. Inadequate coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any drug for which we obtain marketing approval. If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available, or are available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our current and any future product candidates that we develop. Further, coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Therefore, even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 
 Healthcare legislative and regulatory reform measures may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. 
 
 In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. 
 
 Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. 
 
 Reform measures that result in decreased physician reimbursement may adversely affect our business. Further, any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other governmental programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. 
 
 Also, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several U.S. presidential executive orders, Congressional inquiries, proposed and enacted federal and state legislation, and other regulatory actions designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products, and otherwise reduce drug prices. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), among other things, (1) extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage through plan year 2025 in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, marketplaces, (2) eliminates the donut hole under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and through a newly established manufacturer discount program, (3) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and (4) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. The IRA and related federal actions are likely to have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
 
 We cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future. We expect that these and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved drug. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our drugs. 
 
 If any of our current or future product candidates are approved for marketing, and we are found to have improperly promoted off-label uses, or if physicians prescribe or use any of our current or future product candidates off-label, we may become subject to prohibitions on the sale or marketing of any of our current or future product candidates, significant fines, penalties, sanctions, or product liability claims, and our image and reputation within the industry and marketplace could be harmed. 
 
 The FDA, Department of Justice (DOJ), and comparable foreign authorities strictly regulate the marketing and promotional claims that are made about pharmaceutical products, including our product candidates bexicaserin and LP659. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses or indications that are not approved by the FDA or comparable foreign authorities as reflected in the product s approved labeling. Although physicians may prescribe products for off-label uses as the FDA and other regulatory agencies do not regulate a physician s choice of drug treatment made in the physician s independent medical judgment, they do restrict promotional communications from companies or their sales force with respect to off-label uses of products for which marketing clearance has not been issued. If we are found to have promoted such off-label uses, we may receive warning letters from the FDA and comparable foreign authorities and become subject to significant liability, which would materially harm our business. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. If we become the target of such an investigation or prosecution based on our 
 52 

marketing and promotional practices, we could face similar sanctions, which would materially harm our business. In addition, management s attention could be diverted from our business operations, significant legal expenses could be incurred, and our reputation could be damaged. The FDA and other governmental authorities have also required that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed in order to resolve enforcement actions. If we are deemed by the FDA, DOJ, or other governmental authorities to have engaged in the promotion of any current or future product candidates for off-label use, we could be subject to certain prohibitions or other restrictions on the sale or marketing of our products and operations, or significant fines and penalties, and the imposition of these sanctions could also affect our reputation and position within the industry. 
 
 We may not be able to obtain or maintain orphan drug designations or exclusivity for our product candidates, which could limit the potential profitability of our product candidates. 
 
 Regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, the FDA may designate a drug as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. In the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and application fee waivers. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation, however, neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process. Generally, if a drug with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for an indication for which it receives the designation, then the drug is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity that precludes the applicable regulatory authority from approving another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for the exclusivity period except in limited situations. For purposes of small molecule drugs, the FDA defines same drug as a drug that contains the same active moiety and is intended for the same use as the drug in question. A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. 
 
 We may pursue orphan drug designation for one or more of our product candidates, as well as for potential other future product candidates, and obtaining orphan drug designations may be important to our business strategy; however, obtaining an orphan drug designation can be difficult and we may not be successful in doing so. Even if we were to obtain orphan drug designation for a product candidate, we may not obtain orphan exclusivity and that exclusivity may not effectively protect the drug from the competition of different drugs for the same condition, which could be approved during the exclusivity period. Additionally, after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA could subsequently approve another application for the same drug for the same indication if the FDA concludes that the later drug is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States also may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. We will face similar risks if we pursue other designations with the FDA or comparable foreign authorities. The failure to obtain an orphan drug or other designation for any product candidates we may develop, the inability to maintain that designation for the duration of the applicable period, or the inability to obtain or maintain orphan drug or other exclusivity could reduce our ability to make sufficient sales of the applicable product candidate to balance our expenses incurred to develop it, which would have a negative impact on our operational results and financial condition. 
 
 Disruptions at the FDA and other government agencies caused by funding shortages or global health concerns could hinder their ability to hire, retain or deploy key leadership and other personnel, or otherwise prevent new or modified products from being developed, approved or commercialized in a timely manner or at all, which could negatively impact our business. 
 
 The ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review times at the FDA have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. 
 
 Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, the U.S. government has shut down at times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough critical employees and stop critical activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 By way of another example, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA initially postponed most inspections of manufacturing facilities and products, and subsequently restarted routine pre-announced surveillance inspections of domestic 
 53 

manufacturing facilities subject to a risk-based prioritization system to identify the categories of regulatory activity that can occur within a given geographic area, ranging from mission critical inspections to resumption of all regulatory activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, or if global health concerns prevent the FDA or other regulatory authorities from conducting their regular inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA or other regulatory authorities to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property 
 
 We depend on intellectual property licensed from third parties, including Arena, and the failure by us or our licensors to protect the licensed intellectual property or the termination of our license could result in the loss of significant rights, which would harm our business. 
 
 We are dependent on technology, patents, know-how, and proprietary materials, both our own and licensed from Arena, which was acquired by Pfizer in March 2022. We entered into the Arena License Agreement pursuant to which we acquired an exclusive, royalty bearing, sublicensable, worldwide license to develop and commercialize bexicaserin for any use in humans, LP659 for the treatment of certain CNS and peripheral nervous system indications, and certain other compounds for CNS indications. Any termination of this license will result in the loss of significant rights and will restrict our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates. If we or Arena fails to adequately protect this intellectual property, or if we seek to expand the field of our license to include additional indications we determine are advantageous or necessary for us to develop a licensed compound and Arena does not consent, our ability to commercialize these compounds could suffer. 
 
 Agreements under which we license intellectual property or technology to or from third parties may be complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates. Our business also would suffer if any current or future licensors fail to abide by the terms of the license, if we or the licensors fail to enforce licensed patents against infringing third parties, if the licensed patents or other rights are found to be invalid or unenforceable, or if we are unable to enter into necessary licenses on acceptable terms. Moreover, our licensors may own or control intellectual property that has not been licensed to us and, as a result, we may be subject to claims, regardless of their merit, that we are infringing or otherwise violating the licensor s rights. 
 
 Furthermore, while we cannot currently determine the amount of the royalty obligations we would be required to pay on sales of future products, if any, the amounts may be significant. The amount of our future royalty obligations will depend on the technology and intellectual property we use in products that we successfully develop and commercialize, if any. Therefore, even if we successfully develop and commercialize products, we may be unable to achieve or maintain profitability. 
 
 In addition, the growth of our business will likely depend in part on our ability to acquire or in-license additional proprietary rights, including to advance our research or allow commercialization of our product candidates. In that event, we may be required to expend considerable time and resources to develop or license replacement technology. For example, our programs may involve additional technologies or product candidates that may require the use of additional proprietary rights held by third parties. Furthermore, other pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions may also have filed or are planning to file patent applications potentially relevant to our business. Our product candidates may also require specific formulations or other technology to work effectively and efficiently. These formulations or technology may be covered by intellectual property rights held by others. From time to time, in order to avoid infringing these third-party patents, we may be required to license technology from additional third parties to further develop or commercialize our product candidates. We may be unable to acquire or in-license any relevant third-party intellectual property rights, including any such intellectual property rights required to manufacture, use or sell our product candidates, that we identify as necessary or important to our business operations. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all, and as a result we may be unable to develop or commercialize the affected product candidates, and we may have to abandon development of the relevant research programs or product candidates, which would harm our business. We may need to cease use of the compositions or methods covered by such third-party intellectual property rights, and may need to seek to develop alternative approaches that do not infringe on such intellectual property rights which may entail additional costs and development delays, even if we were able to develop such alternatives, which may not be feasible. Even if we are able to obtain a license under such intellectual property rights, any such license may be non-exclusive, which may allow our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. 
 
 54 

The licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive practice, and companies that may be more established, or have greater resources than we do, may also be pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider necessary or attractive in order to commercialize our product candidates. More established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their larger size and cash resources or greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete such negotiations and ultimately acquire the rights to the intellectual property surrounding the additional product candidates that we may seek to acquire. 
 
 Licensing of intellectual property is of critical importance to our business and involves complex legal, business and scientific issues and is complicated by the rapid pace of scientific discovery in our industry. Disputes may also arise between us and our licensors regarding intellectual property subject to a license agreement, including relating to: 
 the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues; 

whether and the extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the license agreement; 

our right to sublicense patent and other rights to third parties under manufacturing, collaborative development or commercial relationships; 

whether we are complying with our diligence obligations with respect to the use of the licensed technology in relation to our development and commercialization of our product candidates, and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations; 

the priority of invention of patented technology; 

the amount and timing of payments owed under license agreements; and 

the allocation of ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and by us and our partners. 

If disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates. We are generally also subject to all of the same risks with respect to protection of intellectual property that we license as we are for intellectual property that we own, which are described below. If we or our licensors fail to adequately protect this intellectual property, our ability to commercialize our products could suffer. 
 
 Furthermore, our existing license agreements impose, and we expect that future license agreements will impose, various diligence, milestone payment, royalty and other obligations on us. If we are unable to, or otherwise fail to, comply with our obligations under these agreements, including due to our use of the intellectual property licensed to us in an unauthorized manner, or we are subject to a bankruptcy, we may be required to pay damages and the licensor may have the right to terminate the license. 
 
 We depend, in part, on our licensors to file, prosecute, maintain, defend, or enforce patents and patent applications that are material to our business. 
 
 Patents relating to our product candidates may be controlled by our licensor. Licensors may have rights to file, prosecute, maintain, and defend the patents we have licensed from such licensor. Our ability to settle legal claims may require consent of licensors. If our licensor or any future licensees having rights to file, prosecute, maintain, and defend our patent rights fail to conduct these activities for patents or patent applications covering any of our product candidates, our ability to develop and commercialize those product candidates may be adversely affected and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using, or selling competing products. We cannot be certain that such activities by our licensor have been or will be conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations or will result in valid and enforceable patents or other intellectual property rights. If our licensor has the right to control enforcement of our licensed patents or defense of any claims asserting the invalidity of these patents and, even if we are permitted to pursue such enforcement or defense, we cannot ensure the cooperation of our licensor. We cannot be certain that our licensor will allocate sufficient resources or prioritize its or our enforcement of such patents or defense of such claims to protect our interests in the licensed patents. Even if we are not a party to these legal actions, an adverse outcome could harm our business because it might prevent us from continuing to license intellectual property that we may need to operate our business. In addition, even when we have the right to control patent prosecution of licensed patents and patent applications, enforcement of licensed patents, or defense of claims asserting the invalidity of those patents, we may still be adversely affected or prejudiced by actions or inactions of our licensor and its counsel that took place prior to or after our assuming control. In the event we breach any of our obligations related to such prosecution, we may incur significant liability to our licensing partners. 
 
 For most licensed products under the Arena License Agreement, including bexicaserin and LP659, we have the first right to control the prosecution and enforcement of the licensed patent applications and patents. However, we have an obligation to reasonably 
 55 

cooperate with Arena, which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer, and will to some extent depend on Arena s cooperation with us to prosecute and enforce such intellectual property. A disagreement between us and Arena with respect to the prosecution or enforcement of the patent applications or patents, or unsuccessful actions to prosecute or enforce the patent applications or patents, could adversely affect our intellectual property rights. 
 
 We may enter into, or seek to enter into, collaboration agreements and strategic alliances, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such collaborations or alliances. Any such collaborations relating to our product candidates could also cause us to alter or delay our development and commercialization plans. 
 
 We intend to broaden the global reach of our platform by potentially selectively collaborating with leading biopharmaceutical companies. We intend to retain significant economic and commercial rights to our programs in key geographic areas that are core to our long-term strategy. As a result, we intend to periodically explore a variety of possible additional strategic collaborations in an effort to gain access to additional product candidates or resources. At the current time, we cannot predict what form such a strategic collaboration might take. We are likely to face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic collaborators, and strategic collaborations can be complicated and time consuming to negotiate and document. We may not be able to negotiate strategic collaborations on acceptable terms, or at all. We are unable to predict when, if ever, we will enter into any additional strategic collaborations because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with establishing them. 
 
 Research and development collaborations are subject to numerous risks, which may include the following: 
 collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to a collaboration, and may not commit sufficient efforts and resources, or may misapply those efforts and resources; 

collaborators may conduct their own clinical trials which may not be compliant, may not be successful or may generate contradictory results; 

collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of collaboration product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on trial or test results, changes in their strategic focus due to the acquisition of competitive products, availability of funding or other external factors, such as a business combination that diverts resources or creates competing priorities; 

collaborators may delay, provide insufficient resources to, or modify or stop clinical trials for collaboration product candidates; 

collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, or acquire products outside of the collaboration that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates; 

a collaborator with marketing, manufacturing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient resources to or otherwise not perform satisfactorily in carrying out these activities; 

we could grant exclusive rights to our collaborators that would prevent us from collaborating with others; 

a collaborator or series of collaborators may improperly or unknowingly sell product directly (or indirectly to a potential customer) into the gray market whereby our branded products are diverted from authorized sales channels into the hands of dealers, brokers or the open market, and may result in unauthorized sale of our product in a specific country or region; 

collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our intellectual property or proprietary information in a way that gives rise to actual or threatened litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential liability; 

disputes may arise between us and a collaborator that cause the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our product candidates, or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources; 

collaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital and personnel to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates; 

a collaborator s sales and marketing activities or other operations may not be in compliance with applicable laws resulting in civil or criminal proceedings; and 

collaborators may own or co-own intellectual property covering our products that results from our collaborating with them, and in such cases, we may not have the exclusive right to commercialize such intellectual property. 

56 

The development and potential commercialization of our product candidates will require substantial additional capital to fund expenses. We may form or seek further strategic alliances, create joint ventures or collaborations, or enter into additional licensing arrangements with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our development and commercialization efforts with respect to our product candidates and any future product candidates that we may develop, including in territories outside the United States or for certain indications. These transactions can entail numerous operational and financial risks, including exposure to unknown liabilities, disruption of our business and diversion of our management s time and attention in order to manage a collaboration or develop acquired products, product candidates or technologies, incurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of equity securities to pay transaction consideration or costs, higher than expected collaboration, acquisition or integration costs, write-downs of assets or goodwill or impairment charges, increased amortization expenses, difficulty and cost in facilitating the collaboration or combining the operations and personnel of any acquired business, impairment of relationships with key suppliers, manufacturers or customers of any acquired business due to changes in management and ownership and the inability to retain key employees of any acquired business. As a result, if we enter into acquisition or in-license agreements or strategic partnerships, we may not be able to realize the benefit of such transactions if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture. We also cannot be certain that, following a strategic transaction or license, we will achieve the revenue or specific net income that justifies such transaction or such other benefits that led us to enter into the arrangement. 
 
 In addition, we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners and the negotiation process is time consuming and complex. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other alternative arrangements for our product candidates because they may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort and third parties may not view our product candidates as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy. If and when we collaborate with a third-party for development and commercialization of a product candidate, we can expect to relinquish some or all of the control over the future success of that product candidate to the third party. Our ability to reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator s evaluation of our technologies, product candidates and market opportunities. The collaborator may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our product candidate. We may also be restricted under any license agreements from entering into agreements on certain terms or at all with potential collaborators. 
 
 As a result of these risks, we may not be able to realize the benefit of our existing collaborations or any future collaborations or licensing agreements we may enter into. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical and biomedical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators and changes to the strategies of the combined company. As a result, we may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail the development of such product candidate, reduce or delay one or more of our other development programs, delay the potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any planned sales or marketing activities for such product candidate, or increase our expenditures and undertake development, manufacturing or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development, manufacturing or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market and generate product revenue. 
 
 Additionally, we may sometimes collaborate with academic institutions to accelerate our preclinical research or development under written agreements with these institutions. Typically, these institutions provide companies like us with an option to negotiate a license to any of the institution s rights in technology resulting from the collaboration. Regardless of such option, we may be unable to negotiate a license within the specified timeframe or under terms that are acceptable to us. If we are unable to do so, the institution may offer the intellectual property rights to other parties, potentially blocking our ability to pursue our program. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property or to maintain the existing intellectual property rights we have, we may have to abandon development of such program and our business and financial condition could suffer. 
 
 Our products will require specific constituents to work effectively and efficiently, and rights to those constituents are and, in the future, may be held by others. We may be unable to in-license any rights to constituents, methods of use, processes or other third-party intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, which would harm our business. In that event, we may be required to expend significant time and resources to develop or license replacement technology. Any delays in entering into new collaborations or strategic partnership agreements related to our product candidates could delay the development and commercialization of our product candidates in certain geographies, which could harm our business prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
 We may be dependent on intellectual property licensed or sublicensed to us from, or for which development was funded or otherwise assisted by, government agencies or academic or other institutions, for development of our technology and product 
 57 

candidates. Failure to meet our own obligations to our licensors or upstream licensors, including such government agencies or academic or other institutions, may result in the loss of our rights to such intellectual property, which could harm our business. 
 
 Government agencies or academic or other institutions may provide funding, facilities, personnel or other assistance in connection with the development of the intellectual property rights owned by or licensed to us. Such government agencies may have retained rights in such intellectual property, including the right to grant or require us to grant mandatory licenses or sublicenses to such intellectual property to third parties under certain specified circumstances, including if it is necessary to meet health and safety needs that we are not reasonably satisfying or if it is necessary to meet requirements for public use specified by federal regulations, or to manufacture products in the United States. Any exercise of such rights, including with respect to any such required sublicense of these licenses could result in the loss of significant rights and could harm our ability to commercialize licensed products. 
 
 If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our current or any future product candidates, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets. 
 
 We anticipate that we will file additional patent applications both in the United States and in other countries, as appropriate. However, we cannot predict: 
 if and when any patents will issue; 

the degree and scope of protection any issued patents will afford us against competitors, including whether third parties will find ways to invalidate or otherwise circumvent our patents; 

whether others will apply for or obtain patents claiming aspects similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications; 

whether we will need to initiate litigation or administrative proceedings to defend our patent rights, which may be costly whether we win or lose; or 

whether the patent applications that we own, or in-license will result in issued patents with claims that cover our product candidates or uses thereof in the United States or in foreign countries. 

We rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our development programs and product candidates. Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our current and any future product candidates. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our current and future development programs and product candidates. The patent prosecution process is expensive and time consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner, including as a result of factors impacting our, our licensors or governmental patent offices operations. 
 
 It is possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. The patent applications that we own or in-license may fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover our current or any future product candidates in the United States or in foreign countries. There is no assurance that all of the potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications has been found, which can invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application. Even if patents do successfully issue and even if such patents cover our current or any future product candidates, third parties may challenge their scope, validity, or enforceability, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated, or held unenforceable. Any successful opposition to these patents or any other patents owned by or licensed to us could deprive us of rights necessary for the successful commercialization of any product candidates or companion diagnostic that we may develop. Further, if we encounter delays in regulatory approvals, the period of time during which we could market a product candidate or companion diagnostic under patent protection could be reduced. 
 
 If the patent applications we hold or have in-licensed with respect to our development programs and product candidates fail to issue, if their breadth or strength of protection is threatened, or if they fail to provide meaningful exclusivity for our current or any future product candidates, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to develop product candidates, and threaten our ability to commercialize, future drugs. Any such outcome could have a negative effect on our business. 
 
 Composition of matter patents for pharmaceutical products often provide a strong form of intellectual property protection for those types of products, as such patents provide protection without regard to any method of use. We cannot be certain, however, that the claims in our pending patent applications covering the composition of matter of our product candidates will be considered patentable by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), or by patent offices in foreign countries, or that the claims in any of our issued patents will be considered valid and enforceable by courts in the United States or foreign countries. Method of use patents protect the use of a product for the specified method. This type of patent does not prevent a competitor from making and marketing a 
 58 

product that is identical to our product for an indication that is outside the scope of the patented method. Moreover, even if competitors do not actively promote their product for our targeted indications, physicians may prescribe these products off-label for those uses that are covered by our method of use patents. Although off-label prescriptions may infringe or contribute to the infringement of method of use patents, the practice is common and such infringement is difficult to prevent or enforce against. 
 
 The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to file for patent protection. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or drugs, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and drugs. 
 
 Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. These changes could also increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. For example, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (Leahy-Smith Act) enacted several significant changes to U.S. patent law, including switching the United States from a first-to-invent system to a first-to-file system, allowing third party submission of prior art to the USPTO during patent prosecution and setting forth additional procedures to attack the validity of a patent by the USPTO-administered post-grant proceedings. Changes such as these could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a negative effect on our business. 
 
 Moreover, we may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the USPTO or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or drugs and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize drugs without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates. 
 
 The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. An adverse determination in any such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and drugs, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and drugs. Moreover, patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are paid timely, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. Various extensions may be available; however, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. For instance, a patent term extension based on regulatory delay may be available in the United States. However, only a single patent can be extended for each marketing approval, and any patent can be extended only once, for a single product. Moreover, the scope of protection during the period of the patent term extension does not necessarily extend to all claims, but instead only to claims that read on the product as approved. Laws governing analogous patent term extensions in foreign jurisdictions vary widely, as do laws governing the ability to obtain multiple patents from a single patent family. Additionally, we may not receive an extension if we fail to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or restoration, or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we will have the right to exclusively market our product will be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration and may take advantage of our investment in development and clinical trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data to launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case, and our revenue could be reduced, possibly materially. In addition, although upon issuance in the United States a patent s life can be increased based on certain delays caused by the USPTO, this increase can be reduced or eliminated based on certain delays caused by the patent applicant during patent prosecution. Without patent protection for our current or future product candidates, including once the patent life has expired even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained, we may be open to competition from generic versions of such drugs. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. Even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired for a product, we may be open to competition from generic medications. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing drugs similar or identical to ours. 
 
 59 

Even if we have or obtain patents covering our products or methods, we may still be barred from making, using and selling such products or methods because of the patent rights of others. Others may have filed, and in the future may file, patent applications covering compositions, products or methods that are similar or identical to ours, which could materially affect our ability to successfully develop our technology or to successfully commercialize any approved products alone or with collaborators. 
 
 Patent applications in the United States and elsewhere are generally published approximately 18 months after the earliest filing for which priority is claimed, with such earliest filing date being commonly referred to as the priority date. Therefore, patent applications covering our methods and products could have been filed by others without our knowledge. Additionally, pending claims in patent applications which have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our platform technologies or related products. These patent applications may have priority over patent applications filed by us. 
 
 Obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by government patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements. 
 
 Periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other government fees on patents and/or applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO and various government patent agencies outside of the United States over the lifetime of our owned and licensed patents and/or applications and any patent rights we may own or license in the future. We rely on our outside counsel, patent annuity service providers, or licensing partners to pay these fees due to non-U.S. patent agencies. The USPTO and various non-U.S. government patent agencies require compliance with several procedural, documentary, and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We employ and expect to continue to employ one or more reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply and we are also dependent on our licensors to take the necessary action to comply with these requirements with respect to our licensed intellectual property. In many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. There are situations, however, in which non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, potential competitors might be able to enter the market and this circumstance could harm our business. 
 
 Patent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product candidates for an adequate amount of time. 
 
 Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates such as bexicaserin, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. We expect to seek extensions of patent terms in the United States and, if available, in other countries where we are prosecuting patents. In the United States, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the normal expiration of the patent, which is limited to the approved indication (or any additional indications approved during the period of extension). However, the applicable authorities, including the FDA and the USPTO in the United States, and any equivalent regulatory authority in other countries, may not agree with our assessment of whether such extensions are available, and may refuse to grant extensions to our patents, or may grant more limited extensions than we request. If this occurs, our competitors may be able to take advantage of our investment in development and clinical trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data and launch their drug earlier than might otherwise be the case. 
 
 Our intellectual property rights do not necessarily protect against all potential threats to our business. 
 
 The degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business. These risks and uncertainties include the following: 
 others may be able to make compounds or formulations that are similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of any patents, should they issue, that we own or control; 

we or any strategic partners might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patents or pending patent applications that we own or control; 

we might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of the product candidates or inventions we own or control; 

others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights; 

pending patent applications that we own or control may not lead to issued patents; 

issued patents that we own or control may be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges; 

60 

our competitors might conduct research and development activities in the United States and other countries that provide a safe harbor from patent infringement claims for certain research and development activities, as well as in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive drugs for sale in our major commercial markets; 

we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; and 

the patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business. 

Third parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a negative impact on the success of our business. 
 
 Our commercial success depends, in part, upon our ability and the ability of our current or future collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell our current and any future product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights and intellectual property of third parties. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive and complex litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Our product candidates and other proprietary technologies we may develop may infringe existing or future patents owned by third parties. We may in the future become party to, or be threatened with, adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our current and any future product candidates and technology, including interference proceedings, post grant review and inter partes review before the USPTO. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future, regardless of their merit. There is a risk that third parties may choose to engage in litigation with us to enforce or to otherwise assert their patent rights against us. Even if we believe such claims are without merit, a court of competent jurisdiction could hold that these third-party patents are valid, enforceable and infringed, which could have a negative impact on our ability to commercialize our current and any future product candidates. In order to successfully challenge the validity of any such U.S. patent in federal court, we would need to overcome a presumption of validity. As this burden is a high one requiring us to present clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of any such U.S. patent claim, there is no assurance that a court of competent jurisdiction would invalidate the claims of any such U.S. patent. If we are found to infringe a third party s valid and enforceable intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing, manufacturing and marketing our product candidate(s) and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors and other third parties access to the same technologies licensed to us, and it could require us to make substantial licensing and royalty payments. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease developing, manufacturing and commercializing the infringing technology or product candidate. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent or other intellectual property right. A finding of infringement could prevent us from manufacturing and commercializing our current or any future product candidates or force us to cease some or all of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 
 Third parties asserting their patent or other intellectual property rights against us may seek and obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of management and other employee resources from our business, cause development delays, and may impact our reputation. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys fees for willful infringement, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, pay royalties, or redesign our infringing products, which may be impossible on a cost-effective basis or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. In that event, we would be unable to further develop and commercialize our product candidates, which could harm our business significantly. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business. 
 
 We are aware of third-party patents and/or patent applications that could adversely affect the potential commercialization of our compounds. For example, we are aware of third-party patents, as well as a third-party patent application, with broad claims to administering an S1P receptor modulator by starting with a lower dose and then increasing to a higher, standard daily dose. Further, we are aware of third-party patent applications with broad claims to administering a 5-HT receptor agonist for epileptic disorders. While we do not believe that any such claims that would cover the potential commercialization of bexicaserin or LP659 would be valid and enforceable, we may be incorrect in this belief. 
 
 61 

We may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, the patents of our licensors or our other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful. 
 
 Competitors may infringe or otherwise violate our patents, the patents of our licensors or our other intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file legal claims, which can be expensive, time consuming, and unpredictable. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or our licensors is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our related patent applications at risk of not issuing. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. The initiation of a claim against a third party may also cause the third party to bring counter claims against us such as claims asserting that our patents are invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, non-enablement or lack of statutory subject matter. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant material information from the USPTO, or made a materially misleading statement, during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar validity claims before the USPTO in post-grant proceedings such as ex parte reexaminations, inter partes review, or post-grant review, or oppositions or similar proceedings outside the United States, in parallel with litigation or even outside the context of litigation. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. We cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. For the patents and patent applications that we have licensed, we may have limited or no right to participate in the defense of any licensed patents against challenge by a third party. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of any future patent protection on our current or future product candidates. Such a loss of patent protection could harm our business. 
 
 Interference or derivation proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to, or the correct inventorship of, our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors. An unfavorable outcome could result in a loss of our current patent rights and could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Litigation, interference, derivation or other proceedings may result in a decision adverse to our interests and, even if we are successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. 
 
 There may be third-party patents of which we are currently unaware with claims to compositions, formulations, methods of manufacture, or methods of use or treatment that cover our product candidates. It is also possible that patents owned by third parties of which we are aware, but which we do not believe are relevant to our product candidates and other proprietary technologies we may develop, could be found to be infringed by our product candidate. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications that may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe. In addition, our competitors in both the United States and abroad, many of which have made substantial investments in patent portfolios and competing technologies, may obtain patents in the future that may prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use and sell our product candidates, and may claim that use of our technologies or the manufacture, use, or sale of our product candidates infringes upon these patents. We may also receive, and expect to receive, communications from various industry participants alleging our infringement of their patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights and/or offering licenses to such intellectual property. 
 
 We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. Our business could be harmed if in litigation the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Any litigation or other proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights may fail, and even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. 
 
 Because of the expense and uncertainty of litigation, we may conclude that even if a third-party is infringing our issued patents, or any patents that may be issued as a result of our pending or future patent applications or other intellectual property rights, the risk-adjusted cost of bringing and enforcing such a claim or action, which typically last for years before they are concluded, may be too high or not in the best interest of our company or our stockholders, or it may be otherwise impractical or undesirable to enforce our intellectual property against some third parties. Our competitors or other third parties may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources and more mature and developed intellectual property portfolios. In such cases, we may decide that the monetary cost of such litigation and the diversion of the attention of our management and scientific personnel could outweigh any benefit we receive as a result of the proceedings and that the more prudent course of action is to simply monitor the situation or initiate or seek some other non-litigious action or solution. In 
 62 

addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation could compromise our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our internal research programs, in-license needed technology or other product candidates, or enter into development partnerships that would help us bring our product candidates to market. 
 
 Even if we establish infringement, the court may decide not to grant an injunction against further infringing activity and instead award only monetary damages, which may or may not be an adequate remedy. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock. 
 
 Issued patents covering our product candidates could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court or before the USPTO or comparable foreign authority. 
 
 If we or one of our licensing partners initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim we infringe their patents or that the patent covering our product candidate is invalid or unenforceable, or both. In any patent infringement proceeding, there is a risk that a court will decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, and that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the invention at issue. There is also a risk that, even if the validity of such patents is upheld, the court will construe the patent s claims narrowly or decide that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the invention at issue on the grounds that our patent claims do not cover the invention, or decide that the other party s use of our patented technology falls under the safe harbor to patent infringement under 35 U.S.C. 271(e)(1). With respect to the validity of our patents, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art of which we, our patent counsel, and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our product candidates and such an outcome may limit our ability to assert our patents against those parties or other competitors and may curtail or preclude our ability to exclude third parties from making and selling similar or competitive products. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business. Similarly, if we assert trademark infringement claims, a court may determine that the marks we have asserted are invalid or unenforceable, or that the party against whom we have asserted trademark infringement has superior rights to the marks in question. In this case, we could ultimately be forced to cease use of such trademarks. 
 
 Changes in U.S. patent law or the patent law of other countries or jurisdictions could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our current and any future product candidates. 
 
 The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on actions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce patents that we have licensed or that we might obtain in the future. Similarly, changes in patent law and regulations in other countries or jurisdictions or changes in the governmental bodies that enforce them or changes in how the relevant governmental authority enforces patent laws or regulations may weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce patents that we have licensed or that we may obtain in the future. 
 
 We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world, which could negatively impact our business. 
 
 Filing, prosecuting and defending patents covering our current and any future product candidates throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can have a different scope and strength than do those in the United States. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own drugs and, further, may export otherwise infringing drugs to territories where we may obtain patent protection, but where patent enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These drugs may compete with our drugs in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued or licensed patents and any future patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing. 
 
 Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property, particularly those relating to biopharmaceutical products, which could make it difficult in those jurisdictions for us to stop the infringement or misappropriation of our patents or other intellectual property rights, or the marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights. Proceedings to enforce our patent and other intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our 
 63 

business. Furthermore, such proceedings could put our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly, could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing, and could provoke third parties to assert claims of infringement or misappropriation against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Similarly, if our trade secrets are disclosed in a foreign jurisdiction, competitors worldwide could have access to our proprietary information and we may be without satisfactory recourse. Such disclosure could have a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be adversely affected by unforeseen changes in foreign intellectual property laws. In addition, certain developing countries, including China and India, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In those countries, we and our licensors may have limited remedies if patents are infringed or if we or our licensors are compelled to grant a license to a third party, which could materially diminish the value of those patents. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. This could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license. 
 
 Reliance on third parties requires us to share our trade secrets, which increases the possibility that a competitor will discover them or that our trade secrets will be misappropriated or disclosed. 
 
 If we rely on third parties to manufacture or commercialize our current or any future product candidates, or if we collaborate with additional third parties for the development of our current or any future product candidates, we must, at times, share trade secrets with them. We may also conduct joint research and development programs that may require us to share trade secrets under the terms of our research and development partnerships or similar agreements. We seek to protect our proprietary technology in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, material transfer agreements, services agreements, consulting agreements or other similar agreements with our advisors, employees, third-party contractors and consultants prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information. These agreements typically limit the rights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information, including our trade secrets. Despite the contractual provisions employed when working with third parties, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements. Given that our proprietary position is based, in part, on our know-how and trade secrets, a competitor s discovery of our trade secrets or other unauthorized use or disclosure could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 
 In addition, these agreements typically restrict the ability of our advisors, employees, third-party contractors and consultants to publish data potentially relating to our trade secrets. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets, our competitors may discover our trade secrets, either through breach of our agreements with third parties, independent development or publication of information by any third-party collaborators. A competitor s discovery of our trade secrets could harm our business. 
 
 Confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties may not prevent unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information. 
 
 In addition to the protection afforded by patents, we seek to rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable or that we elect not to patent, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce, and any other elements of our product candidates, technology and product discovery and development processes that involve proprietary know-how, information, or technology that is not covered by patents. Any disclosure, either intentional or unintentional, by our employees, the employees of third parties with whom we share our facilities or third-party consultants and vendors that we engage to perform research, clinical trials or manufacturing activities, or misappropriation by third parties (such as through a cybersecurity breach) of our trade secrets or proprietary information could enable competitors to duplicate or surpass our technological achievements, thus eroding our competitive position in our market. Because we expect to rely on third parties in the development and manufacture of our product candidates, we must, at times, share trade secrets with them. Our reliance on third parties requires us to share our trade secrets, which increases the possibility that a competitor will discover them or that our trade secrets will be misappropriated or disclosed. 
 
 Trade secrets and confidential information, however, may be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our trade secrets, know-how and confidential information, including our proprietary processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific advisors, contractors, and collaborators. With our consultants, contractors, and outside scientific collaborators, these agreements typically include invention assignment obligations. We cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with each party that may have or has had access to our trade secrets or proprietary technology and processes, or that any such agreements will be adequate. Although we seek to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, outside scientific advisors, contractors, and collaborators might intentionally or inadvertently disclose our trade secret information to competitors or otherwise misappropriate our information, and in certain cases third parties who we may share confidential information have negotiated limits on their liability in their agreements with us. In addition, competitors may otherwise gain access to our trade 
 64 

secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor or other third-party, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. Furthermore, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad. If we are unable to prevent unauthorized material disclosure of our intellectual property to third parties, or misappropriation of our intellectual property by third parties, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 
 We may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants, or advisors have wrongfully used or disclosed trade secrets or other confidential information of their current or former employers or claims asserting inventorship or ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property. 
 
 Many of our employees, consultants, and advisors are currently or were previously employed at universities or other healthcare, biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees, consultants, and advisors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these individuals have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such individual s current or former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. 
 
 We may be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators, or other third parties have an interest in our patents or other intellectual property as an inventor or co-inventor. The failure to name the proper inventors on a patent application can result in the patents issuing thereon being unenforceable. Inventorship disputes may arise from conflicting views regarding the contributions of different individuals named as inventors, the effects of foreign laws where foreign nationals are involved in the development of the subject matter of the patent, conflicting obligations of third parties involved in developing our product candidates or as a result of questions regarding co-ownership of potential joint inventions. For example, we may have inventorship disputes arise from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. Alternatively, or additionally, we may enter into agreements to clarify the scope of our rights in such intellectual property. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees. 
 
 In addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. The assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self-executing, or the assignment agreements may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. Such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 
 
 We may not identify relevant third-party patents or may incorrectly interpret the relevance, scope or expiration of a third-party patent, which might adversely affect our ability to develop and market our products. 
 
 We cannot guarantee that any of our patent searches or analyses, including the identification of relevant patents, the scope of patent claims or the expiration of relevant patents, are complete or thorough, nor can we be certain that we have identified each and every third-party patent and pending application in the United States and abroad that is relevant to or necessary for the commercialization of our product candidates in any jurisdiction. The scope of a patent claim is determined by an interpretation of the law, the written disclosure in a patent and the patent s prosecution history. Our interpretation of the relevance or the scope of a patent or a pending application may be incorrect, which may negatively impact our ability to market our products. We may incorrectly determine that our products are not covered by a third-party patent or may incorrectly predict whether a third-party s pending application will issue with claims of relevant scope. Our determination of the expiration date of any patent in the United States or abroad that we consider relevant may be incorrect, which may negatively impact our ability to develop and market our product 
 65 

candidates. Our failure to identify and correctly interpret relevant patents may negatively impact our ability to develop and market our products. 
 
 One aspect of the determination of patentability of our inventions depends on the scope and content of the prior art, information that was or is deemed available to a person of skill in the relevant art prior to the priority date of the claimed invention. There may be prior art of which we are not aware that may affect the patentability of our patent claims or, if issued, affect the validity or enforceability of a patent claim. Further, we may not be aware of all third-party intellectual property rights potentially relating to our product candidates or their intended uses, and as a result the impact of such third-party intellectual property rights upon the patentability of our own patents and patent applications, as well as the impact of such third-party intellectual property upon our freedom to operate, is highly uncertain. Because patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for typically a period of 18 months after filing, or may not be published at all, we cannot be certain that we were the first to file any patent application related to our product candidates. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Furthermore, for U.S. applications in which all claims are entitled to a priority date before March 16, 2013, an interference proceeding can be provoked by a third party or instituted by the USPTO to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications. For U.S. applications containing a claim not entitled to priority before March 16, 2013, there is a greater level of uncertainty in the patent law in view of the passage of the America Invents Act, which brought into effect significant changes to the U.S. patent laws, including new procedures for challenging pending patent applications and issued patents. 
 
 If our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected. 
 
 Our trademarks or trade names may be challenged, opposed, infringed, circumvented, invalidated, cancelled, declared generic, determined to be not entitled to registration, or determined to be infringing on other marks. During trademark registration proceedings, we may receive rejections of our applications by the USPTO or in foreign jurisdictions. Although we would be given an opportunity to respond to those rejections, we may be unable to overcome such rejections. In addition, in the USPTO and in comparable agencies in many foreign jurisdictions, third parties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks, and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings. Any trademark litigation could be expensive. In addition, we could be found liable for significant monetary damages, including treble damages, disgorgement of profits and attorneys fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a trademark. We may not be able to protect our exclusive right to these trademarks and trade names or may be forced to stop using these names, which we need for name recognition by potential collaborators or customers in our markets of interest. If we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected. We may license our trademarks and trade names to third parties, such as distributors. Though these license agreements may provide guidelines for how our trademarks and trade names may be used, a breach of these agreements or misuse of our trademarks and tradenames by our licensees may jeopardize our rights in or diminish the goodwill associated with our trademarks and trade names. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties or Their Actions 
 
 We intend to rely on third parties to conduct, supervise and monitor our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and if those third parties perform in an unsatisfactory manner, it may harm our business. 
 
 We do not currently have the ability to independently conduct preclinical studies or clinical trials required to develop our drug candidates. We intend to rely on CROs, clinical trial sites and other third parties to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and we expect to have limited influence over their actual performance. We intend to rely upon CROs and others to monitor, manage and report data for our clinical trials, which includes biostatistical analysis and programming, as well as the execution of future nonclinical studies. We expect to control only certain aspects of our CROs and others activities. Nevertheless, we will be responsible for ensuring that each of our preclinical studies or clinical trials are conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards and our reliance on the CROs and others does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. 
 
 We, our CROs and other third parties we might engage will be required to comply with good laboratory practices (GLPs) and GCPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities in the form of International Conference on Harmonization guidelines for any of our product candidates that are in preclinical and clinical development. The regulatory authorities enforce GCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and clinical trial sites. Although we will rely on CROs and others to conduct GCP-compliant clinical trials, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our GLP preclinical studies and clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its investigational plan and protocol and applicable laws and regulations, and our reliance on the CROs and others does not relieve us of our regulatory 
 66 

responsibilities. If we, our CROs and other third parties we engage fail to comply with GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. Accordingly, if our CROs or others fail to comply with these regulations or fail to recruit a sufficient number of participants, we may be required to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. 
 
 While we will have agreements governing their activities, our CROs and other third parties we engage will not be our employees, and we will not control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our future clinical and nonclinical programs. These CROs and others may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical trials, or other drug development activities which could harm our business. We face the risk of potential unauthorized disclosure or misappropriation of our intellectual property by CROs and others, which may reduce our trade secret protection and allow our potential competitors to access and exploit our proprietary technology. In addition, certain of our agreements with CROs and other third parties provide for monetary and other limitations on their liability. If our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations, fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for any other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize any product candidate that we develop. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for any product candidate that we develop would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed, decreased or eliminated. 
 
 If our relationship with these CROs terminates, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or adding additional CROs involves substantial cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays occur, which can negatively impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Though we intend to carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and prospects. 
 
 In addition, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and receive compensation in connection with such services. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to report some of these relationships to the FDA. The FDA may conclude that a financial relationship between us and a principal investigator has created a conflict of interest or otherwise affected interpretation of the trial. The FDA may therefore question the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized. This could result in a delay in approval, or rejection, of our marketing applications by the FDA and may ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of our current and future product candidates. 
 
 We do not have our own manufacturing capabilities and will rely on third parties to produce clinical and commercial supplies of our current and any future product candidates. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts. 
 
 We have no or limited experience in drug formulation or manufacturing as a company, and we do not own or operate, and we do not expect to own or operate, facilities for drug manufacturing, storage and distribution, or testing. We will be dependent on third parties to manufacture the clinical supplies of our product candidates. 
 
 Further, we also will rely on third-party manufacturers to supply us with sufficient quantities of our product candidates, to be used, if approved, for commercialization. We do not have long-term supply agreements or commitments with a manufacturer to produce raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients or the finished products of our product candidates or the associated packaging. Furthermore, the raw materials for our product candidates are sourced, in some cases, from a single-source supplier. If we were to experience an unexpected loss of supply of any of our product candidates or any of our future product candidates for any reason, whether as a result of manufacturing, supply or storage issues or otherwise, we could experience delays, disruptions, suspensions or terminations of, or be required to restart or repeat, any pending or ongoing clinical trials. For example, legislation such as the Biosecure Act, adverse macroeconomic or geopolitical developments such as a health epidemic or pandemic, or the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, could impact our ability to procure sufficient supplies for the development of our products and product candidates. Any significant delay in the supply of a product candidate, or the raw material components thereof, for an ongoing clinical trial due to the need to replace a third-party manufacturer could considerably delay completion of our clinical trials, product testing and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates. 
 
 67 

Our reliance on third-party manufacturers entails various risks, some of which we would not be subject to if we manufactured product candidates ourselves, including: 
 inability to meet our drug specifications and quality requirements consistently; 

delay or inability to procure or expand sufficient manufacturing capacity; 

issues related to scale-up of manufacturing; 

costs and validation of new equipment and facilities required for scale-up; 

failure to comply with cGMP or similar foreign standards; 

inability to negotiate manufacturing agreements with third parties under commercially reasonable terms, if at all; 

termination or nonrenewal of manufacturing agreements with third parties in a manner or at a time that is costly or damaging to us; 

reliance on single sources for drug components; 

lack of qualified backup suppliers for those components that are currently purchased from a sole or single source supplier; 

misappropriation of proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how; 

the mislabeling of clinical supplies, potentially resulting in the wrong dose amounts being supplied or study drug or placebo not being properly identified; 

clinical supplies not being delivered to clinical sites on time, leading to clinical trial interruptions, or drug supplies not being distributed to commercial vendors in a timely manner, resulting in lost sales; 

operations of our third-party manufacturers or suppliers being disrupted by conditions unrelated to our business or operations, including the bankruptcy of the manufacturer or supplier; and 

carrier disruptions or increased costs that are beyond our control. 

We do not have complete control over all aspects of the manufacturing process of, and are dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with cGMP regulations for manufacturing both active drug substances and finished drug products. Third-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with cGMP regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside of the United States. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or others, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain marketing approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, we do not have control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain marketing approval for or market our product candidates, if approved. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or drugs, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our product candidates or drugs and harm our business and results of operations. 
 
 Our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates or drugs may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any product candidates that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis. 
 
 If we or our third-party manufacturers use hazardous and biological materials in a manner that causes injury or violates applicable law, we may be liable for damages. 
 
 Our research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including chemical and biological materials, by our third-party manufacturers. Our manufacturers are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations in the United States governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of medical, radioactive and hazardous materials. Although we believe that our manufacturers procedures for using, handling, storing and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from medical, radioactive or hazardous materials. As a result of any such contamination or injury, we may incur liability or local, city, state or federal authorities may curtail the use of these materials and interrupt our business operations. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines, and the liability could exceed our resources. We do not have any insurance for liabilities arising from 
 68 

medical radioactive or hazardous materials. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development, and production efforts, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 
 Arena was acquired by Pfizer in 2022, and Arena s acquisition may negatively impact our development programs and stock price. 
 
 On March 11, 2022, Pfizer acquired Arena, and Arena became a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer. We have licensed product candidates, including bexicaserin and LP659, from Arena under the Arena License Agreement, and we rely on Arena to help protect intellectual property relating to our licensed products. We do not know if Pfizer will cooperate with us in protecting the intellectual property relating to our licensed products. We also do not know if Pfizer will view our development programs positively or negatively, or as complimentary or competitive to its development programs. We are also entitled to receive information and milestones and royalty payments under the Royalty Purchase Agreement. If a disagreement between us and Pfizer were to occur, Arena might challenge our rights or default on its obligations in the Arena License Agreement, the Royalty Purchase Agreement or another agreement between us, any of which could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop our licensed products or on our stock price. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Business Operations, Employee Matters and Managing Growth 
 
 We are highly dependent on the services of our senior management team and if we are not able to retain these members of our management team and recruit and retain additional management, clinical and scientific personnel, our business will be harmed. 
 
 We are highly dependent on our senior management team. The employment agreements we have with these officers do not prevent such persons from terminating their employment with us at any time. The loss of the services of any of these persons could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives. 
 
 In addition, we will need to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified additional management, clinical and scientific personnel. If we are not able to retain our management and to attract, on acceptable terms, additional qualified personnel necessary for the continued development of our business, we may not be able to sustain our operations or grow. 
 
 We may not be able to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses. Many of the other pharmaceutical companies that we compete against for qualified personnel and consultants have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and a longer history in the industry than we do. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. Some of these characteristics may be more appealing to high-quality candidates and consultants than what we have to offer. In response to competition and adverse macroeconomic and geopolitical developments, including inflation and labor shortages, we may need to adjust employee cash compensation, which would affect our operating costs and our margins, or equity compensation, which would affect our outstanding share count and cause dilution to existing stockholders. Despite our efforts to retain valuable employees, members of our management, scientific and development teams may terminate their employment with us on short notice. If we are unable to continue to attract, retain and motivate high-quality personnel and consultants to accomplish our business objectives, the rate and success at which we can discover and develop product candidates and our business will be limited and we may experience constraints on our development objectives. 
 
 Our future performance will also depend, in part, on our ability to successfully integrate newly hired executive officers into our management team and our ability to develop an effective working relationship among senior management. Our failure to integrate these individuals and create effective working relationships among them and other members of management could result in inefficiencies in the development and commercialization of our product candidates, harming future regulatory approvals, sales of our product candidates and our results of operations. Additionally, we do not currently maintain key person life insurance on the lives of our executives or any of our employees. 
 
 We will need to expand our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations. 
 
 We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, operational inefficiencies, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Our expected growth could require significant effort and capital expenditures and may divert attention and financial resources from other projects, such as the development of our current and potential future product candidates. If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate and grow revenue could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance, our ability to commercialize 
 69 

product candidates, develop a scalable infrastructure and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth. 
 
 International expansion could expose us to business, regulatory, political, operational, financial, pricing and reimbursement risks associated with doing business outside of the United States. 
 
 We are subject to risks associated with conducting business internationally. Some of our suppliers are located outside of the United States, and we are conducting a global Phase 3 program for bexicaserin, which will involve additional vendors and clinical sites outside of the United States. Furthermore, our business strategy incorporates potential international expansion, including the potential hiring of employees or contractors to help manage aspects of the global Phase 3 program for bexicaserin. Similarly, we may explore opportunities with potential partners outside the United States. Doing business internationally involves a number of risks, including but not limited to: 
 multiple, conflicting and changing laws and regulations, such as privacy regulations, tax laws, export and import restrictions, employment laws, regulatory requirements, and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses; 

economic, political, legal and social conditions in other countries (such as China), changes in government relations between such other countries and the United States or other governments, uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and such other countries (including with respect to trade policies, treaties, government regulations and tariffs), and differences in the economies of such other countries including with respect to the amount of government involvement, level of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources; 

failure by us to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for the conduct of clinical trials in various countries; 

difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; 

rejection or qualification of foreign clinical trial data by the competent authorities of other countries; 

delays or interruptions in the supply of clinical trial materials resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; 

additional potentially relevant third-party patent and other intellectual property rights; 

complexities and difficulties in obtaining, maintaining, protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights; 

currency exchange rate fluctuations and the cost and risk of entering into hedging transactions if we choose to do so in the future; 

natural disasters, political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism and political unrest, outbreak of disease and related shelter-in-place orders, travel, social distancing and quarantine policies, boycotts, curtailment of trade and other business restrictions; 

expenses for travel and insurance; and 

regulatory and compliance risks that relate to anti-corruption compliance and record-keeping that may fall within the purview of the FCPA, its accounting provisions or its anti-bribery provisions or provisions of anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws in other countries. 

Any of these factors could harm our future international expansion and operations and, consequently, our results of operations. 
 
 Our employees, principal investigators, consultants and commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading. 
 
 We are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, independent contractors, CROs, principal investigators, consultants and commercial partners. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations or the regulations applicable in other jurisdictions, provide accurate information to the FDA and other regulatory authorities, comply with manufacturing standards, comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Such misconduct also could involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials or interactions with the FDA or other regulatory authorities, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates and begin commercializing those products, our potential exposure under such 
 70 

laws will increase significantly, and our costs associated with compliance with such laws are also likely to increase. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from government investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations. 
 
 Significant disruptions of our information technology systems or data security incidents could result in significant financial, legal, regulatory, business and reputational harm to us. 
 
 We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure, including mobile technologies, to operate our business. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store, process and transmit large amounts of sensitive information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, personal data and other confidential information. We have also outsourced elements of our operations (including elements of our information technology infrastructure) to third parties, and as a result, we manage a number of third-party vendors who may have access to our computer networks or our confidential information. In addition, many of those third parties in turn subcontract or outsource some of their responsibilities to third parties. While all information technology operations are inherently vulnerable to inadvertent or intentional security breaches, incidents, attacks and exposures, the accessibility and distributed nature of our information technology systems, and the sensitive information stored on those systems, make such systems potentially vulnerable to unintentional or malicious, internal and external attacks on our technology environment. In addition, we have enabled our employees to work remotely, which may make us more vulnerable to cyberattacks. Furthermore, past or future business transactions could expose us to risks and vulnerabilities. Potential vulnerabilities can be exploited from inadvertent or intentional actions of our employees, third-party vendors, business partners, malicious third parties and other sources. Attacks of this nature are increasing in their frequency, levels of persistence, sophistication and intensity, and are being conducted by sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives (including, but not limited to, industrial espionage) and expertise, including organized criminal groups, hacktivists, nation states and others. In addition to the access to or extraction of sensitive information, such attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, malicious code (such as viruses and worms), ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering (including through deep fakes, which may be increasingly more difficult to identify as fake, and phishing attacks) and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. In particular, ransomware attacks have become increasingly prevalent and severe. Our reliance on third parties could also introduce new cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities, including supply-chain attacks. In addition, the prevalent use of mobile devices increases the risk of data security incidents. Furthermore, our sensitive information could be leaked, disclosed or revealed as a result of or in connection with our employees', personnel's or vendors' use of generative AI technologies. 
 
 Significant disruptions of our, our third-party vendors and/or our business partners information technology systems or other similar data security incidents could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss, misappropriation, and/or unauthorized access, use or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, sensitive information, which could result in financial, legal, regulatory, business and reputational harm to us. In addition, information technology system disruptions, whether from attacks on our technology environment or from other failures of our data or information systems such as natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures, could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Additionally, theft of our intellectual property or proprietary business information could require substantial expenditures to remedy. If we or our third-party collaborators, consultants, contractors, suppliers, or service providers were to suffer an attack or breach, for example, that resulted in the unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of personal or health information, we may have to notify consumers, partners, collaborators, government authorities, and the media, and may be subject to investigations, civil penalties, administrative and enforcement actions, and litigation, any of which could harm our business and reputation. 
 
 There is no way of knowing with certainty whether we have experienced any data security incidents that have not been discovered. While we have no reason to believe this to be the case, attackers have become very sophisticated in the way they conceal access to systems, and many companies that have been attacked are not aware that they have been attacked. Any event that leads to unauthorized access, use or disclosure of sensitive information, including but not limited to personal data regarding our clinical trial participants or employees, whether in our possession or in the possession of third parties upon whom we rely, could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, compel us to comply with applicable federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to time consuming, distracting and expensive litigation, regulatory investigation and oversight, mandatory 
 71 

corrective action, require us to verify the correctness of database contents, or otherwise subject us to liability under laws, regulations and contractual obligations, including those that protect the privacy and security of personal information. This could result in increased costs to us, and result in significant legal and financial exposure and/or reputational harm. Limitations of liability in contracts and/or insurance coverage may be inadequate. For example, our insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect us from privacy and security liabilities, such coverage may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or such coverage may not pay future claims. Moreover, data security incidents and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm of the type described above. While we have implemented security measures intended to protect our information technology systems and infrastructure, there can be no assurance that such measures will successfully prevent service interruptions or security incidents. 
 
 We could be subject to securities class action litigation. 
 
 In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because biopharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price and volume volatility in recent years that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources, which could harm our business, operating results or financial condition. 
 
 Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock 
 
 An active, liquid and orderly trading market for our common stock may not be sustained. 
 
 We have a limited number of shares that trade each day compared to many other companies. You may not be able to sell your shares quickly or at the market price if trading in shares of our common stock is not active. 
 
 Further, a less active market may impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock and may impair our ability to enter into strategic partnerships or acquire companies or products by using our shares of common stock as consideration. 
 
 The trading price of our stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment. 
 
 The trading price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including limited trading volume. In addition to the factors discussed in this Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, these factors include: 
 the commencement, enrollment or results of our ongoing and planned preclinical studies and clinical trials, or any future pre-clinical studies or clinical trials we may conduct, of our current and any future product candidates, or changes in the development status of our current and any future product candidates; 

any delay in our regulatory filings for our current and any future product candidates and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the applicable regulatory authority s review of such filings, including without limitation the FDA s issuance of a refusal to file letter or a request for additional information; 

adverse results or delays in our preclinical studies and clinical trials, including as a result of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities disagreeing with the design or implementation of our clinical trials; 

our decision to initiate a clinical trial, not to initiate a clinical trial, or to terminate an existing clinical trial; 

adverse regulatory decisions, including failure to receive regulatory approval for our current and any future product candidates; 

changes in laws or regulations applicable to our current and any future product candidates, including but not limited to clinical trial requirements for approvals; 

the failure to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement of our current and any future product candidates, if approved; 

changes to the structure of healthcare payment systems; 

changes to our relationship with any manufacturers, suppliers, licensors, future collaborators or other strategic partners; 

our inability to obtain adequate product supply for any approved drug product or inability to do so at acceptable prices; 

our inability to establish collaborations if needed, on favorable terms or at all; 

our failure to commercialize our current and any future product candidates; 

72 

any termination or loss of rights under the Arena License Agreement or Royalty Purchase Agreement; 

additions or departures of key clinical, scientific or management personnel; 

unanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of our current and any future product candidates; 

introduction of new products or services offered by us or our competitors, or the release or publication of clinical trial results from competing product candidates; 

announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments by us or our competitors; 

our inability to effectively manage our growth; 

actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results; 

our cash position; 

our failure to meet the estimates and projections of the investment community or that we may otherwise provide to the public; 

publication of research reports about us or our industry or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts; 

changes in the market valuations of similar companies; 

overall performance of the equity markets; 

issuances of debt or equity securities; 

sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future, or the perception that such sales may occur; 

trading volume of our common stock; 

changes in accounting practices; 

ineffectiveness of our internal controls; 

disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters, and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies; 

significant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation; 

geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions, including the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, economic slowdowns, recessions, inflation, high interest rates, bank failures and tightening of credit markets ; and 

other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control. 

In addition, the stock market in general, and biopharmaceutical companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities. This type of litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources, which would harm our business, operating results or financial condition. 
 
 We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock. 
 
 We have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings, if any, for the development, operation, and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders would therefore be limited to the appreciation, if any, of their stock. 
 
 The dual class structure of our common stock may limit your ability to influence corporate matters and may limit your visibility with respect to certain transactions. 
 
 The dual class structure of our common stock may limit your ability to influence corporate matters. Holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote per share, while holders of our non-voting common stock are not entitled to any votes. Nonetheless, each share of our non-voting common stock may be converted at any time into one share of our common stock at the option of its holder by 
 73 

providing written notice to us, subject to the limitations provided for in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Consequently, if holders of our non-voting common stock exercise their option to make this conversion, this will have the effect of increasing the relative voting power of those prior holders of our non-voting common stock, and correspondingly decreasing the voting power of the holders of our common stock, which may limit your ability to influence corporate matters. 
 
 Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by our existing stockholders in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could cause our stock price to fall. 
 
 If our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline. In January 2024, Arena, a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer, reported that it had sold 3,978,540 shares of our common stock. Substantial sales of our common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could cause our stock price to fall. 
 
 Future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to the Sales Agreement and our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall. 
 
 Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall. 
 
 We expect that we will need significant additional capital in the future to continue our planned operations, including conducting clinical trials, commercialization efforts if we are able to obtain marketing approval of any of our current or future product candidates, research and development activities, and costs associated with operating as a public company. To raise capital, we may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. For example, we entered into the Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald, and in August 2023 we filed a prospectus supplement providing for the issuance and sale, from time to time, of shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 75.0 million through Cantor Fitzgerald acting as the sales agent. We sold 1,422,250 shares of common stock under the Sales Agreement for gross proceeds of 8.8 million in 2023. In March 2024 we filed a sales agreement prospectus to offer up to 150.0 million of shares of common stock under the Sales Agreement (exclusive of shares previously sold), and we had not sold any shares under the most recent sales agreement prospectus as of September 30, 2024. In January 2024, we completed an underwritten public offering of common stock in which we sold 11,500,000 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of 241.5 million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. In March 2024, we completed a private placement of 2,850,000 shares of non-voting common stock for gross proceeds of 59.9 million. If we sell additional common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to the holders of our common stock. 
 
 Pursuant to our 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (2021 Plan), our management is authorized to grant stock options to our employees, directors and consultants. Additionally, the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our 2021 Plan automatically increases on January 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 2022, and continuing through and including January 1, 2031, by 5 of the total number of shares of our capital stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year (determined on an as-converted to voting common stock basis, without regard to any limitations on the conversion of the non-voting common stock), or a lesser number of shares determined by our board of directors. 
 
 In addition, pursuant to our ESPP, the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance automatically increases on January 1 of each calendar year, beginning on January 1, 2022, and continuing through January 1, 2031, by the lesser of (i) 1 of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding (determined on an as-converted to voting common stock basis, without regard to any limitations on the conversion of the non-voting common stock) on the last day of the fiscal year before the date of the automatic increase and (ii) such number of shares of common stock that would cause the aggregate number of shares of common stock then reserved for issuance under the ESPP to equal 1,060,017 shares, or a lesser number of shares determined by our board of directors. 
 
 Unless our board of directors elects not to increase the number of shares available for future grant pursuant to our 2021 Plan and ESPP each year, our stockholders may experience additional dilution, which could cause our stock price to fall. 
 
 74 

We are an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company, and the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors. 
 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (JOBS Act). For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This provision allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards, and therefore we will not be subject to the same requirements to adopt new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. 
 
 We are also a smaller reporting company as defined in the Exchange Act. We may take advantage of exemptions and scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies, similar to those available to emerging growth companies, including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our annual reports and proxy statements. Investors may find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions and reduced disclosure obligations. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. 
 
 As of June 30, 2024, the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded 700.0 million. As a result, we will be a large accelerated filer and thus will cease to be an emerging growth company effective December 31, 2024. Additionally, we will no longer qualify as a smaller reporting company beginning with our first Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ending March 31, 2025. 
 
 Delaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our common stock. 
 
 Provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in our control or change in our management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares or transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests. Therefore, these provisions could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Among other things, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws: 
 permit our board of directors to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with any rights, preferences and privileges as they may designate (including the right to approve an acquisition or other change in our control); 

provide that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors; 

provide that our board of directors or any individual director may only be removed with cause and the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66-2/3 of the voting power of all of our then-outstanding common stock; 

provide that all vacancies, including newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum; 

divide our board of directors into three classes; 

require that any action to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and not be taken by written consent; 

provide that stockholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of stockholders must provide notice in writing in a timely manner and also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder s notice; 

do not provide for cumulative voting rights (therefore allowing the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election, if they should so choose); 

75 

provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chair of our board of directors, our Chief Executive Officer or by the board of directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors; and 

provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, as described below. 

The amendment of any of these provisions, with the exception of the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and designate any rights, preferences and privileges thereto, would require approval by the holders of at least 66-2/3 of our then-outstanding common stock. 
 
 In addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time. A Delaware corporation may opt out of this provision by express provision in its original certificate of incorporation or by amendment to its certificate of incorporation or bylaws approved by its stockholders. However, we have not opted out of this provision. 
 
 These and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirors to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by our then-current board of directors, including delay or impede a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving our company. The existence of these provisions could negatively affect the price of our common stock and limit opportunities for you to realize value in a corporate transaction. 
 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States of America are the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees. 
 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the court s having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law: 
 any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; 

any action or proceeding asserting a breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders; 

any action or proceeding asserting a claim against us or any of our current or former directors, officers or other employees arising out of or pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or bylaws; 

any action or proceeding to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; 

any action or proceeding as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; and 

any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers or other employees that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. 

This provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation further provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America is the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions. 
 
 76 

These exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If a court were to find either exclusive forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, all of which could seriously harm our business. 
 
 General Risk Factors 
 
 We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives. 
 
 As a public company, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, which require, among other things, that we file with the SEC annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently adopted by the SEC and Nasdaq to implement provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, impose significant requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Further, in July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) was enacted. There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that require the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas such as say on pay and proxy access. Emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies are exempted from certain of these requirements. As of June 30, 2024, the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded 700.0 million. Consequently, we will be a large accelerated filer and will therefore cease to be an emerging growth company effective December 31, 2024. As a result of this transition, we will be subject to certain disclosure and compliance requirements that apply to other public companies but did not previously apply to us due to our status as an emerging growth company and expect to incur additional legal and financial compliance costs as a result. Stockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. 
 
 We expect the rules and regulations applicable to public companies to continue to substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. If these requirements divert the attention of our management and personnel from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The increased costs will continue to decrease our net income or increase our net loss, and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business or increase the prices of our products or services. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers. 
 
 If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and the trading price of our common stock may decline. 
 
 Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is required to report upon the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. When we lose our status as an emerging growth company, if we do not qualify as a non-accelerated filer, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. As of June 30, 2024, the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded 700.0 million. Consequently, we will be a large accelerated filer and will therefore cease to be an emerging growth company effective December 31, 2024. The rules governing the standards that must be met for our management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation. To comply with the requirements of being a reporting company under the Exchange Act, we will need to upgrade our information technology systems; implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures; and hire additional accounting and finance staff. If we or, if required, our auditors are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and the trading price of our common stock may decline. 
 
 We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting once that firm begin its Section 404 reviews, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy 
 77 

and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets. 
 
 Our business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders, and such activism could impact the trading value of our securities. 
 
 Stockholders may, from time to time, engage in proxy solicitations or advance stockholder proposals, or otherwise attempt to effect changes and assert influence on our board of directors and management. Activist campaigns that contest or conflict with our strategic direction or seek changes in the composition of our board of directors could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A proxy contest would require us to incur significant legal and advisory fees, proxy solicitation expenses and administrative and associated costs and require significant time and attention by our board of directors and management, diverting their attention from the pursuit of our business strategy. Any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction and control, our ability to execute on our strategy, or changes to the composition of our board of directors or senior management team arising from a proxy contest could lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business or instability which may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, make it more difficult to pursue our strategic initiatives, or limit our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. If individuals are ultimately elected to our board of directors with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively implement our business strategy and create additional value for our stockholders. We may choose to initiate, or may become subject to, litigation as a result of the proxy contest or matters arising from the proxy contest, which would serve as a further distraction to our board of directors and management and would require us to incur significant additional costs. In addition, actions such as those described above could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based upon temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business. 
 
 Our failure to meet Nasdaq s continued listing requirements could result in a delisting of our common stock. 
 
 If we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our common stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we can provide no assurance that any action taken by us to restore compliance with listing requirements would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with the listing requirements of Nasdaq. 
 
 If securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline. 
 
 The trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price may decline. If one or more of these analysts discontinues coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline. 
 
 Artificial intelligence presents new risks and challenges to our business. 
 
 AI generally refers to the application of technology to perform tasks resembling human cognitive function. As with many technological innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could impact our business. 
 
 AI uses algorithms to enable continuous learning from new input data and development of new or adjusted output based on the learnings. Data therefore plays a critical role in the training and success of any AI application. If an AI tool is permitted to access our proprietary, confidential, or personal data, these data could be at risk of improper use or disclosure. For example, our vendors may incorporate generative AI tools into the products or services that we use. If the providers of these generative AI tools do not meet existing or rapidly evolving regulatory or industry standards with respect to privacy and data protection, or if our vendors or third-party partners experience an actual or perceived breach or privacy or security incident because of the use of generative AI, we may lose valuable intellectual property and other sensitive information, become subject to government action or lawsuits from third parties, and our reputation could be harmed. Further, malicious third parties around the world use increasingly sophisticated methods, including AI, to engage in illegal activities such as the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. Any 
 78 

of these outcomes could damage our reputation, result in the loss of valuable property and information, and otherwise adversely impact our business. 
 
 We may also face increased competition from other companies that are using AI, some of which may develop more effective methods than we and any of our business partners have, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. In addition, uncertainties regarding developing legal and regulatory requirements and standards may require significant resources to modify and maintain business practices to comply with U.S. and non-U.S. laws concerning the use of AI, the nature of which cannot be determined at this time.
