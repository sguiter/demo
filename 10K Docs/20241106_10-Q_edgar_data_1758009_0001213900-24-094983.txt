Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements 

September 30, 2024 

, the trading symbol for the Company s common stock, par value , on the OTC
Market changed from IBGH to QUBT . On July 15, 2021 the Company uplisted to The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. On
June 16, 2022, the Company merged with QPhoton, Inc. QPhoton ), a developer of quantum photonic systems and related technologies
and applications. 

Nature of Business 

QCi is an American company utilizing integrated
photonics and non-linear quantum optics to deliver quantum and ancillary products for high-performance computing applications based on
patented and proprietary photonics technology. QCi s products are designed to operate at room temperature and at very low power
levels beyond the capabilities of other systems in the market. Our core photonics technology enables the execution of a go-to-market strategy
which emphasizes accessibility and affordability. Our quantum machines enable subject matter experts (SMEs) and end users to deliver critical
business solutions today in working with highly complex optimization problems. 

The Company initially focused on providing software
tools and applications for several commercially available quantum computers. However, following the June 2022 merger with QPhoton and
its associated intellectual property and engineering team, the Company now offers integrated high-performance quantum systems, ancillary
products and services. 

The core of our quantum offerings today is our
Entropy Quantum Computing EQC technology. We have built room-temperature, photonic quantum information processing systems
underpinned by a series of patented and patent pending technologies. Our technology, supported by professional services through our Quantum
Solutions offering, enables our clients to solve complex optimization problems. In addition, our engineering teams are using our
leading-edge photonics technology to continue to enhance and further develop quantum LIDAR sensing and imaging systems, quantum-secured
network solutions, and photonic chips. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the continuity of operations, the realization of
assets, and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Cash and cash equivalents on hand were million as of
September 30, 2024. The Company has historically incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations. As of September 30, 2024, the
Company also had an accumulated deficit of million and working capital of million. Furthermore, we have not achieved
a level of sales adequate to support the Company s cost structure and may need to raise additional funds in the next 12 months by
selling additional equity or incurring debt. It is management s opinion that these conditions raise substantial doubt about our
ability to continue as a going concern.

to pretax loss from
continuing operations as a result of both temporary and permanent differences in the U.S. GAAP vs tax treatment of certain types of expenses,
including stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, research and development and meals and entertainment. Additionally,
the Company's policy is to account for interest and penalties as income tax expense. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the
Company had no interest related to unrecognized tax benefits, and no amounts for penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were recognized
in the provision for income taxes. We do not anticipate any significant change within 12 months of this reporting date. 

As of September 30, 2024, in addition to the 
million in tax-effected NOL carryforwards, at an assumed tax rate of , the significant components of the Company s net deferred
tax assets included stock-based compensation of million, capitalized research and development expenditures of approximately 
million and an intangible asset basis difference of approximately million. The Company believes that it is more likely than not that
the benefit from the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, it has provided a full valuation allowance on any potential
deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance increased by approximately million for the period ended September 30, 2024, as compared
to the year ended December 31, 2023. The provision for income taxes is not material in the years presented due to there being no taxable
income. 

The Company has federal R D credit carryforwards
of approximately thousand for the period ended September 30, 2024, which will be applied against payroll taxes, not against income
taxes. The Company has no state R D credit carryforwards. 

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S.
federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions, with varying statutes of limitations. The tax years from inception through 2024
remain open to examination due to the carryover of unused net operating losses that are being carried forward for tax purposes.

Secured Promissory Note 

On August 6, 2024, the Company entered into a
Securities Purchase Agreement (the Secured SPA with Streeterville Capital, LLC Streeterville ), pursuant
to which the Company issued and sold to Streeterville a Secured Convertible Promissory Note (the Streeterville Convertible Note in the original principal amount of million. The principal amount includes an original issue discount of thousand. Streeterville
paid million in cash for the Streeterville Convertible Note. The Streeterville Convertible Note accrues interest at a rate of 
per annum and has a maturity date of February 6, 2026, unless earlier prepaid, redeemed or accelerated in accordance with its terms prior
to such date. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the Streeterville Convertible Note primarily for general working
capital purposes, including for (i) operations as the Company increases its sales and marketing efforts; (ii) capital expenditures in
outfitting its chip fabrication facility in Tempe, AZ; and (iii) for any other planned or unplanned expenditures that might arise in support
of the Company s business plan. Ascendiant Capital Markets, LLC served as the placement agent on the transaction and received a
fee of thousand, and the Company recognized thousand in other issuance costs, primarily for legal services. 

The Streeterville Convertible Note is secured
by all of the Company s tangible and intangible assets, including intellectual property, pursuant to that certain Security Agreement
(the Security Agreement and IP Security Agreement (the IP Security Agreement ), each entered into with Streeterville
on August 6, 2024. In addition, the Company s wholly-owned subsidiaries, QPhoton, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, Qubittech
International, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Qubittech, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and QI Solutions, Inc., a Delaware corporation (collectively,
the Guarantors ), provided a guarantee (the Guaranty ), dated as of August 6, 2024, of the Company s obligations
to Streeterville under the Streeterville Convertible Note and the other transaction documents. 

Beginning on February 6, 2025, Streeterville has
the right to redeem up to of the Streeterville Convertible Note per calendar month. The Company may pay such redemption amounts
in cash, by converting such applicable redemption amount into shares of common stock at the applicable Conversion Price (as defined below)
at such time, or in any combination of cash and shares of common stock, provided that the Company is required to pay any redemption amounts
in cash under certain circumstances set forth in the Streeterville Convertible Note and that the payment of any redemption amount or portion
thereof in cash is subject to an premium.

greater than the closing trade price on the previous trading day or at any time
following an event of default, at a conversion price equal to of the average of the two lowest daily volume weighted average
prices of the Company s common stock during the eight trading day period prior to the respective conversion date (the
 Conversion Price ), subject to anti-dilution adjustments and provided that Streeterville may not request any conversion
of the Streeterville Convertible Note to the extent that such conversion would cause Streeterville (together with its affiliates) to
beneficially own shares of Common Stock exceeding (or if the Market Capitalization, as defined below, is less than
 million) of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such date. For the ownership limitation, Market
Capitalization means a number equal to (a) the average volume weighted average price of the Company s common stock
for the immediately preceding 15 trading days, multiplied by (b) the aggregate number of outstanding shares of common
stock as reported on Company s most recently filed Form 10-Q or Form 10-K or as reported to Nasdaq in a
subsequent shares outstanding change form. Absent an uncured event of default, as set forth in the Streeterville Convertible Note,
Streeterville agreed to limit its aggregate sales of Conversion Shares on the open market in any given calendar week to of the
weekly trading volume of the Company s common stock on our principal trading market (Nasdaq) for such week. Upon evaluation,
the Company determined that the conversion features inherent in the Streeterville Convertible Note meet the definition of a
derivative liability (the Streeterville Derivative Liability covered under the ASC topic 815, Derivatives and
Hedging. Applying ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, the initial fair value of the Streeterville Derivative Liability is 
thousand, which will be mark-to-market adjusted on a quarterly basis and accreted as interest expense using the effective interest
rate method while the Streeterville Convertible Note is outstanding. 

In addition to the beneficial ownership limitations
provided in the Streeterville Convertible Note, the sum of the number of shares of the Company s common stock that the Company may
issue to Streeterville under the Secured SPA, the Streeterville Convertible Note and any related documents without stockholder approval
may not exceed the number of shares it could so issue pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d) (the Share Cap ),
unless shareholder approval (the Approval to exceed such limitation is obtained by the Company. The Company is required,
under the Secured SPA to obtain the Approval by February 2, 2025. If the Company does not obtain the Approval by such date, it must
continue seeking the Approval every 90 days until the Approval is obtained. If the total cumulative number of Conversion Shares that the
Company issues to Streeterville equals the Share Cap and the Company has not obtained the Approval, any remaining outstanding balance
of the Streeterville Convertible Note must be repaid in cash. 

The Streeterville Convertible Note provides for
customary events of default (each as defined in the Streeterville Convertible Note, an Event of Default ), including, among
other things, the event of nonpayment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts, a representation or warranty proving to have been
incorrect when made, failure to perform or observe covenants within a specified cure period, a cross-default to certain other indebtedness
and material agreements of the Company, and the occurrence of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event affecting the Company. Upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default that is deemed a Major Trigger Event as defined in the Streeterville Convertible Note,
Streeterville may increase the outstanding balance of the Streeterville Convertible Note by , and upon the occurrence of an Event of
Default that is deemed a Minor Trigger Event as defined in the Streeterville Convertible Note, Streeterville may increase
the outstanding balance of the Streeterville Convertible Note by . Streeterville can exercise its right to increase the outstanding
balance upon a Major or Minor Trigger Event three times each. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Streeterville may declare all
amounts owed under the Streeterville Convertible Note immediately due and payable. In addition, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default,
upon the election of Streeterville, interest shall begin accruing on the outstanding balance of the Streeterville Convertible Note from

On August 16, 2022, BV Advisory filed a complaint
in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the DE Chancery Court naming the Company and certain of its directors
and officers (among others) as defendants seeking, among other relief, monetary damages. The Company believes that BV Advisory s
claims have no merit and intends to defend itself vigorously. BV Advisory s claims are not covered by the Company s liability
insurance, nor does the Company believe it is necessary to accrue an amount in addition to the BV Advisory Payable at this time. 

BV Advisory v. QCi Appraisal Action 

BV Advisory was purportedly a shareholder of QPhoton,
Inc., the predecessor in interest to QPhoton, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (both referred to as QPhoton 
in this Legal Proceedings discussion). BV Advisory rejected the Merger Consideration (as defined below) and on October 13, 2022, commenced
litigation by filing a petition in the DE Chancery Court seeking appraisal rights on the shares of QPhoton it allegedly owned (which shares
represented of the shares of QPhoton outstanding immediately prior to the Company s acquisition of QPhoton). The Company included
BV Advisory s purported ownership of QPhoton in the purchase price accounting for the QPhoton Merger. 

The Company s total purchase price of QPhoton
was approximately million, or million net of cash acquired, consisting of Company common stock, Series B Preferred Stock and
QPhoton Warrants (as defined below). While the total shares of the Company s common stock on an as-converted basis offered in the
QPhoton Merger was (the Merger Consideration ), the fair market valuation contemplated of the shares,
which assumed full conversion of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock to common stock at the 10:1 ratio, and that only 
of the warrants to purchase up to shares of the Company s common stock (the QPhoton Warrants would eventually
be exercised (specifically only the QPhoton Warrants for which the associated Company options and/or warrants had an exercise price at
or below at the time of the QPhoton Merger). 

Accordingly, as of September 30, 2024 and 2023,
the Company has neither issued shares of the Company s common stock on an as converted basis (the Unissued QPhoton
Shares nor warrants to purchase shares of the Company s common stock (the Unissued QPhoton Warrants that were included in the Merger Consideration. The Unissued QPhoton Shares are included in the statement of stockholder s equity
as additional paid in capital as of as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the Unissued QPhoton Warrants have no carrying value as a liability
on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. 

shares of preferred stock as Series A preferred stock, par value 
per share, of which and shares, respectively, are issued and outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

A Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase shares of the Company s common stock (the Preferred Warrants for an aggregate purchase price of million. The Private Placement was completed and closed to further investment on November 17,
2021. 

The Series A Preferred Stock ranks senior to common
stock with respect to the payment of dividends and liquidation rights. Each holder of Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to receive,
with respect to each share of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding and held by such holder, dividends at the rate of ten percent per annum (the Preferred Dividends. The Company is obligated to pay the Preferred Dividends quarterly, in arrears,
within fifteen (15) days of the end of each quarter. The Company has the option to pay the Preferred Dividends in cash or in common stock,
at a price per share of common stock equal to the average of the closing sale price of the common stock for the five (5) trading days
preceding the applicable dividend payment date. The Preferred Dividends are accrued monthly, but not compounded, and are recorded as interest
expense, because the Preferred Dividends are mandatory and not declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors. 

The number of shares of the Company s common stock issuable upon
conversion of any share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be determined by dividing (x) the Conversion Amount of such share of Series
A Preferred Stock by (y) the Conversion Price. Conversion Amount means, with respect to each share of Series A Preferred
Stock, as of the applicable date of determination, the sum of (1) the stated value thereof plus (2) any accrued dividends. Conversion
Price means, with respect to each share of Series A Preferred Stock, as of any optional conversion date, Mandatory Conversion Date
or other date of determination, , subject to adjustment for stock splits, dividends, recapitalizations and similar corporate events. 

The Preferred Warrants were two -year warrants
to purchase shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of per share, subject to adjustment, were exercisable
at any time on or after the date that was six months following the issuance date, and provided for cashless exercise in the event the
underlying shares of the Company s common stock are not registered. As of December 31, 2023, all of the Preferred Warrants had expired
unexercised. 

In connection with the Purchase Agreement, the
Company and the Series A Investors entered into a registration rights agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement pursuant
to which the Company agreed to file a registration statement to register the shares of the Company s common stock underlying the
Series A Preferred Stock and warrants within 180 days. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Series A Investors received
certain rights, including but not limited to piggyback registration rights, providing that the holder be given notice of any proposed
registration of securities by the Company, and requiring that the Company register all or any portion of the registrable securities that
the holders request to be registered, in each case, subject to the terms and conditions of the Registration Rights Agreement. On April
27, 2022 the Company filed a Resale Form S-3 as required by the Registration Rights Agreement. The Resale Form S-3 went effective on June
2, 2022. 

On June 13, 2022, one of the Series A Investors,
Falcon Capital Partners, converted shares of Series A Preferred Stock into shares of the Company s common stock. 

On February 9, 2023, one of the Series A Investors,
Greenfield Children, LLC, converted shares of Series A Preferred Stock plus accrued dividends into shares of the Company s
common stock.

million of additional paid in capital was reclassified from shareholders equity
to mezzanine equity (the Mezzanine Equity on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30,
2024, in accordance with Accounting Series Release No. 268, Presentation in Financial Statements of Redeemable Preferred Stocks .
The Mezzanine Equity is valued at the date of the Private Placement issuance. Pursuant to the Series A Redemption Agreement, the Company
agreed to redeem all outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock for an aggregate cash purchase price of , or per
share, at its sole discretion, in 18 monthly payments (each a Monthly Redemption Threshold payment), which may be accelerated
at the Company s sole discretion. In addition, the Series A Holders agreed to waive (the Waivers ), on a month-by-month
basis following each monthly payment, certain rights granted to them in (i) the Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation (the Preferred
Stock COD ), including for the accrual and payment of accrued and future dividends; and (ii) the Preferred Stock Securities Purchase
Agreement (the Preferred Stock SPA ). In the event the Company opts to not make a Monthly Redemption Threshold payment, the
Waivers are forfeited and the terms revert to those detailed in the Preferred Stock COD and Preferred Stock SPA. During the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company redeemed and shares of Series A Preferred Stock, respectively,
for approximately million and million, in cash paid to the Series A Holders, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023, there were and shares of Series A Preferred Stock, respectively, issued and outstanding. 

At-the-Market-Facility 

On October 28, 2022, the Company filed a shelf
registration statement on Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which was declared effective on November 8, 2022 (the
 2022 shelf ). Under the 2022 Shelf at the time of effectiveness, the Company had the ability to raise up to million
by selling common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units. On December 5, 2022, the Company entered into an At-the-Market
Issuance Sales Agreement (the ATM Agreement with Ascendiant Capital Markets, LLC Ascendiant whereby the
Company may, but is not obligated to, offer and sell, from time to time, shares of its common stock (the ATM Facility ),
and incorporated the ATM Agreement into the 2022 Shelf by amendment that was declared effective January 10, 2023. On August 17, 2023,
the Company and Ascendiant entered into an amendment (the ATM Amendment to the ATM Agreement, increasing the amount of
common stock that the Company may offer and sell via the ATM Facility from million to million (the ATM Upsize ).
Following the ATM Upsize, the Company filed a prospectus supplement, dated August 18, 2023, with the Securities and Exchange Commission
and became able to offer and sell shares of the Company s common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to via
the ATM Facility. 

The Company intends to use any net proceeds from
the sale of securities under the ATM Facility for operations and for other general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to,
capital expenditures, including our AZ Chips Facility, as defined in Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations , payments under the Series A Redemption Agreement and general working capital. The Company did
not sell any shares through the ATM Facility for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and for the nine months ended September 30,

Those warrants are exercisable when and if stock options and warrants issued by the Company and outstanding as of June 15, 2022 (the Underlying
Options are exercised. As of September 30, 2024, none of the QPhoton Warrants linked to the outstanding Underlying Options are
expected to be exercised as the exercise prices of the Underlying Options are above the closing stock price as of September 30, 2024.
The million issued warrants represent a portion of the million warrants included in the Merger Consideration, having been received
by two QPhoton shareholders. A third alleged shareholder rejected the Merger Consideration and commenced litigation, and to date that
litigation has not been resolved and the warrants have not been issued. See Part II, Item 1, Legal Proceedings , for additional
information on the status of the litigation. 

Accordingly, as of September 30, 2024, of

Total stock-based compensation 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, stock-based compensation on the statements of stockholders equity was lower by thousand and lower by thousand,
respectively, as compared to the expense recorded due to timing differences between award dates and the realization of stock-based compensation
expense. The net expense of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily attributable to vesting expense recognition,
offset by insignificant pre-vesting forfeitures of common stock options for separated employees. 

In terms of new issuances, the Company issued
 thousand shares of common stock to former executives in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 per their respective employment and
separation agreements (the Separation Agreement Shares ). In conjunction with the Separation Agreement Shares, the Company
recognized thousand of stock-based compensation expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and does not expect future
expense related to these offerings as they are fully vested. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company issued
 million shares of common stock to employees as performance and incentive awards (the 2023 Incentive Shares ). The 2023
Incentive Shares included thousand shares of common stock issued to 35 employees as payment in lieu of cash for 2022 performance bonuses
(the Bonus Incentive Shares and million shares of common stock as long-term incentive bonuses to five employees identified
as key technical staff (the Retention Incentive Shares ). The Bonus Incentive Shares are restricted and subject to the following

been prepared giving effect to such restatement. 

Overview 

QCi is a development stage company. Our strategy
is to create a range of accessible and affordable quantum machines and photonics chips for use by commercial and government markets. We
have developed and continue to primarily develop quantum and photonics products for high-performance computing applications based on patented
and proprietary technology. Our technology is central to our strategy because we believe that it enables us to leverage the advantages
of size, weight, power and cost (over competing cryogenic products) to drive market adoption and volume of sales. Specifically, our products
are designed to operate at room temperature and at very low power levels at an affordable cost. 

QCi s core technology is Entropy Quantum
Computing EQC ). EQC is a patent pending methodology that utilizes the environment to drive controlled energy loss in a
photonic architecture. The Company believes that EQC s small rack-mountable size and low-energy consumption provides a substantial
competitive edge as compared to superconducting, cryogenic quantum systems offered by competitors that are also designed to solve optimization
problems. In addition to our photonic computing platform, we have leveraged QCi s core technology to demonstrate powerful quantum
sensing use cases in LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), reservoir computing (a form of neural network that can be used in machine learning
applications) and quantum cyber authentication (a method for highly secure communication within a network). Several of these important
technologies are already in early stages of commercialization. 

1 

Our longer-term product development plan is to
migrate product designs based on discrete components to a set of optical integrated circuits built on wafers using a crystalline material
called lithium niobate Thin Film Lithium Niobate or TFLN ). The Company believes that TFLN is an excellent
material for design and implementation of optical integrated circuits TFLN Chips suitable for our quantum computing and
sensing products because it is crystal based and hence can have optical waveguides directly etched into the material. QCi possesses strong
domain experience and intellectual property in TFLN design and chip fabrication and has completed initial production of several specialty
devices such as electro-optical modulators EOM s ). TFLN EOM s have the advantages of large bandwidth, low power
consumption, and small size. The Company has begun buildout of a state-of-the-art TFLN chip manufacturing facility (the AZ Chips
Facility in a leased space within Arizona State University s Research Park in Tempe, Arizona. The Company s understanding
is that this could be the nation s first dedicated optical integrated circuit manufacturing foundry using TFLN wafers to achieve
quantum effects and superior optical interconnects for data centers. Our plan for the facility is to produce a range of custom lithium
niobate chips for use in our own product lines as well as chips for sale in the commercial market. The Company has plans to support this
initiative by applying for funding for distinct uses under both the Title 17 Clean Energy Financing Program managed by the US Department
of Energy s Loan Programs Office and also the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors Act of 2022, which specifically
includes 39 billion in manufacturing incentives and 13 billion to support new research and development. 

We believe that the practical benefits to the
customer of QCi s core offerings are: 

Powerful performance in speed and quality of solution for large complex optimization problems; 

Plug and play compatibility with existing IT infrastructure; 

Low power consumption normal operation under 80 watts; and 

Scalability with potential for migration to nanophotonic system-on-a-chip designs. 

The Company has limited operations, has generated
limited revenue based on sales of products and related services to date, and is expanding our sales and marketing efforts to support our
current portfolio of commercially-available products and planned TFLN Chips. 

Market Opportunity 

Despite enormous growth in the capabilities of
conventional computers and silicon microprocessors, some of the world s most important computational problems are still considered
impractical to solve in a reasonable period of time. Quantum computing represents a potential alternative approach to solving those problems
because quantum computers apply the properties of quantum physics to operate in a fundamentally different way. Conventional computer chips
use binary bits (ones and zeros) to represent information. Quantum computers utilize qubits (quantum bits), which leverage some of the
properties of quantum physics, namely superposition and entanglement, to process computations that would be intractably difficult using
conventional computers. Quantum machines are intrinsically able to search very large solution spaces using these quantum effects and are
thereby able to perform optimization calculations in polynomial time vs. exponential time. 

While quantum-based computers will not replace
conventional computers in most applications, they are ideally suited to run optimization algorithms, as well as to calculate certain sensing,
imaging, and cybersecurity problems that are beyond the reach of general silicon-based computing today. The Company believes that quantum
solutions have the potential to bring order of magnitude advances in the fields of medicine, engineering, autonomous vehicles, and cybersecurity
and that the demand for quantum computing in these market sectors will likely outpace and outperform the general-purpose computing market
in the near- to mid-term and into the foreseeable future. 

Our core technology offers practical, cost-effective
solutions that materially advance the adoption of quantum machines across several market segments including: 

1. 
 Quantum Computing; 

2. 
 Quantum Intelligence (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning); 

3. 
 Remote Sensing; 

4. 
 Imaging; and 

5. 
 Cybersecurity.

Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks 

The markets for high-performance conventional
and quantum computing and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new computing devices,
while also enhancing competing cloud-based services for businesses. Aggregate demand for our solutions, services, and devices is also
correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended
time in pace with this changing environment. 

The investments we are making in Quantum Optical
Chips and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. Components for our devices are
primarily manufactured by third parties. Some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers.
Extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand. 

Our success is highly dependent on our ability
to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent. We compete for talented individuals by offering
an exceptional working environment, an ability to work on new, ground-breaking quantum technology, the ability to grow one s career
across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits.

Revenues for the three months ended September
30, 2024 were 101 thousand compared to 50 thousand for the comparable prior year period, an increase of 51 thousand or 102 . Revenues
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 311 thousand compared to 283 thousand for the comparable prior year period, an increase
of 28 thousand or 10 . The respective increases in revenues are primarily due to changes in the number of, size of and level of effort
performed on active customer proof-of-concept and research and development services and custom hardware contracts. 

Cost of Revenues 

Cost of revenues, which consists of direct labor
expenses, primarily salary costs for engineering and solutions staff delivering services, and other direct component costs for custom
hardware on research and development contracts, was 92 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 24 thousand
for the comparable prior year period, an increase of 68 thousand or 283 . Cost of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024
was 233 thousand compared to 131 thousand for the comparable prior year period, an increase of 102 thousand or 78 . The respective
increases are both primarily due to the increases in direct labor expenses and other direct costs required to perform on the contracts
during the 2024 periods compared to the prior year periods. 

Gross Margin 

Gross margin for the three months ended September
30, 2024 was 9 thousand and 9 compared to 26 thousand and 52 for the comparable prior year period, a decrease of 17 thousand and
43 , respectively. Gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 78 thousand and 25 compared to 152 thousand and 54 ,
a decrease of 74 thousand and 29 , respectively, compared to the comparable period of 2023. The respective changes were nearly entirely
the result of a new custom hardware contract that has lower margins due to its cost of revenues being comprised of other direct component
costs in addition to direct labor expenses. Our lack of a scaled and distributed base of revenue generation by product and sales channel
can result in significant differences in gross margin between reporting periods. 

Operating Expenses 

Information about our operating expenses for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is set forth in the below tables (in thousands, except percentages). Operating
expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 1.2 million and 2.7 million, respectively, in each case
primarily as a result of lower general and administrative expenses of approximately 900 thousand and selling and marketing expenses of
approximately 200 thousand.

Research and development expenses consist primarily
of labor expenses for employees that primarily engage in research and development efforts and non-labor expenses for the development of
hardware products and supporting software. We focus the bulk of our research and development activities on the continued development of
existing products and the development of new offerings for emerging market opportunities. 

4 

Research and development expenses for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024 decreased compared to the comparable prior year periods primarily due to a reduction in employee-related expenses,
primarily as a result of decreased bonus expenses. These decreases were partially offset by net increases in stock-based compensation
as the Company sought to create long-term incentives to retain key technical, sales and administrative employees. See Note 12, Stock-based
Compensation , in the accompanying notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information.

services and decreased marketing program costs as management continued to refine the Company s approach to product and services
sales.

consulting services. 

General and administrative expenses for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased compared to the comparable prior year period primarily due to lower
employee- and advisor-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, payroll, bonus and travel expenses, as well as lower
legal fees and consulting services costs driven by changes made within and by the Company s management team, offset by
increased audit fees driven by the Company retaining a new independent registered public accounting firm and such firm s
re-audit of the Company s financial statements for the years ending December 31, 2023 and 2022. 

Non-operating Income (Expense)

Net other expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared
to the comparable prior year period is virtually unchanged, with the approximate 62 thousand decrease in net interest expense offsetting
the approximate 56 thousand decrease in interest income. The 449 thousand decrease in other expense for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 compared to the comparable prior year period is the result of the 872 thousand decrease in interest expense for the Company s
financial liabilities offset by a 384 thousand reduction in gains in the fair value of the QPhoton Warrant liability. 

Interest and other income consists of earned interest on loans receivable
and cash and cash equivalents. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies Cash and Cash Equivalents , in the accompanying
notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on where the Company maintains its cash
balances. The decreases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily
due to the Company maintaining lower cash balances in mutual funds and deposit and money market accounts during the 2024 periods compared
to the 2023 periods. 

5 

Interest expense, net consists of interest on financial liabilities,
amortization of debt issuance costs, and accretion of derivative interest. The decrease in interest expense in 2024 compared to 2023 was
attributable to decreased borrowings outstanding under the Streeterville Unsecured Note which was paid-in-full as of March 1, 2024, partially
offset by new borrowings under the Streeterville Convertible Note that we issued in August 2024. See Note 8, Financial Liabilities ,
in the accompanying notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

The gain on change in value of warrant liability
is comprised of mark-to-market adjustments for the QPhoton Warrants, which have no carrying value as of September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023. Future mark-to-market adjustments may result in losses if the Company s stock price increases above the exercise price
of the Underlying Options, as defined below. See Note 11, Capital Stock - Warrants , in the accompanying notes to our unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on the QPhoton Warrants . There was no mark-to-market for
the Streeterville Derivative Liability as of September 30, 2024. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We have incurred net losses and experienced negative
cash flows from operations since inception. Through September 30, 2024, the Company has raised 68.3 million through private and public
placements of equity and 12.6 million through private placements of convertible promissory notes and other debt for a total of 80.9
million. The Company has no lines of credit or short-term debt obligations outstanding when excluding the remaining debt issuance costs.
We expect to incur additional losses and higher operating expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and
development and go-to-market programs. We have determined that additional financing will be required to fund our operations for the next
12 months and our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining additional capital and financing. As of September
30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of 3.1 million. 

Our primary uses of cash are to fund and invest in our operations as
we continue to grow our business. We will require a significant amount of cash for continued investment in our AZ Chips Facility and ongoing
research and development for our non-linear quantum optical products and photonics chips. Until such time as we can generate significant
revenue from sales or subscriptions of our hardware offerings, we expect to finance our cash needs through public and/or private equity
and/or debt financings or other capital sources, including but not limited to U.S. government grant and loan programs. However, we may
be unable to raise sufficient funds or enter into such other arrangements, when needed, on favorable terms, or at all. In particular,
uncertain and unfavorable conditions in the United States and global macroeconomic environment, including inflationary pressures, rising
interest rates, bank failures, and financial and credit market fluctuations, could reduce our ability to access capital on favorable terms,
or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest
of our stockholders will be, or could be, diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that
adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing and equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that
include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures
or declaring dividends. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to
delay, limit, or substantially reduce our product development and go-to-market efforts. It is management s opinion that these conditions
raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of 12 months from the date of the
issuance of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurances that the Company will be
able to secure additional equity investments or achieve an adequate sales level. 

The following table summarizes total consolidated
current assets, liabilities and working capital at September 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023 (in thousands):

At September 30, 2024, we had working capital of 1.5 million as compared
to a working capital deficit of 2.2 million at December 31, 2023, an increase of 3.7 million. The increase in working capital is primarily
attributable to an increase in cash proceeds from our issuance of shares of common stock using the Company s ATM Facility and our
issuance of the Streeterville Convertible Note, offset by the use of cash to pay for operating expenses and capital investments in property
and equipment.

Cash Flows

 (4,315 

Net cash used in operating activities for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 12.4 million and 13.3 million, respectively, in each case primarily as a result of
our net loss in each period offset by noncash adjustments for stock-based compensation, mark-to-market valuation adjustments on financial
liabilities, and depreciation and amortization. 

Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023 was 3.2 million and 2.7 million, respectively, and was attributable to our purchase of computer hardware, laboratory
and TFLN Chips manufacturing equipment. The increase in investment in the 2024 period is primarily due to the purchase of additional equipment
in connection with establishing the Company s AZ Chip Facility. 

Net cash provided by financing activities was 16.6 million and 18.1
million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Cash flows provided by financing activities during the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 were attributable to proceeds from our sale of shares of common stock pursuant to the ATM Facility and our issuance of the Streeterville Convertible Note, partially offset by repayments on the Streeterville Unsecured Note and redemptions
of shares of Series A Preferred Stock. Cash flows provided by financing activities during the period ended September 30, 2023 were attributable
to proceeds from our sale of shares of common stock pursuant to the ATM Facility, partially offset by repayments on the Streeterville
Unsecured Note. 

On a long-term basis, our liquidity is
dependent on the continuation and expansion of operations and receipt of revenues. Demand for our products and services will be
dependent on, among other things, market acceptance of our products and services, the technology market in general, and general
economic conditions, which are cyclical in nature. As most of our revenues will be from the sales of our products and services, our
business operations may be adversely affected by the actions of our competitors and prolonged recession periods 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Certain of our accounting policies require the
application of significant judgment by our management, and such judgments are reflected in the amounts reported in our consolidated financial
statements. In applying these policies, our management uses judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination
of estimates. Those estimates are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of market trends, information
provided by our strategic partners and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. Actual results may differ significantly
from the estimates contained in our consolidated financial statements. 

Fair Value of Stock-based Compensation and
Derivatives 

We recognize stock-based compensation expense
for all share-based payment awards in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation . Stock-based compensation
expense for expected-to-vest awards is valued under the single-option approach and amortized on a straight-line basis, accounting for
actual forfeitures as they occur. We utilize the Black-Scholes pricing model in order to determine the fair value of stock-based option
awards. The Black-Scholes pricing model requires various highly subjective assumptions including volatility, expected option life, and
risk-free interest rate. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management s
best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. If factors change and different
assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. 

Another area of critical accounting estimates
involves determining the fair market value of the QPhoton Warrants. The Company determines which underlying options and warrants are in-the-money
or out-of-the-money at period end by comparing to the bid price of the Company s common stock, then accounts for changes period-over-period
by realizing a mark-to-market gain or loss for the period. 

Another area of critical accounting estimates involves determining the fair value of the Streeterville Derivative Liability, which involves
inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgement. The Streeterville Derivative Liability will be mark-to-market adjusted
on a quarterly basis and accreted as interest expense while the Streeterville Convertible Note is outstanding. 

7 

Fair Market Value and Useful Life of Intangible
Assets 

Determining the fair market value and useful life
of the intangible assets acquired by the Company through the merger with QPhoton is another critical accounting estimate. In the absence
of market pricing for the intangible assets, the Company relied on independent third-party appraisal experts and comparison with similar
transactions to arrive at estimates of value as well as useful life. The Company will perform periodic assessments of the intangible assets
for impairment, but if any of the initial estimates are incorrect, that could result in a calculation of amortization expense that is
too high or too low. 

Valuation Allowances for Deferred Taxes 

Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and
liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s assessment of estimated current and future income taxes
to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the United States. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated
income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits. 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from
temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements,
which are expected to result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets
within the jurisdiction from which they arise, for all material jurisdictions, we consider all available positive and negative evidence,
including scheduled reversals of deferred tax balances, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of recent
operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future
state, federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. The assumptions about future
taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses.
In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating results. 

As of September 30, 2024,
we had federal and state net operating loss NOL carryforwards of approximately 60.1 million, or 15.6 million on a tax-effected
basis. We believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from these NOL carryforwards will not be realized. Accordingly, we
have provided a full valuation allowance on any potential deferred tax assets relating to these NOL carryforwards. If our assumptions
change and we determine we will be able to realize these NOLs, the tax benefits relating to any reversal of the valuation allowance on
deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2024, will be accounted for as a reduction of income tax expense. 

The calculation of our
tax liabilities involves evaluating uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions
across our global operations. ASC 740, Income Taxes , states that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized
when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any related appeals
or litigation processes, on the basis of the technical merits. 

We record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities
in accordance with ASC 740 and adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not
previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a tax payment that
is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as
increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is made available. 

We believe that none of the unrecognized tax benefits
may be recognized by the end of 2024. 

Legal and Other Contingencies 

The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought
against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued
by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can
be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of
an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially
impact our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk 

Not applicable. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, 
as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). In designing
and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how
well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures
are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment
in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and
procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any
design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 

As of the end of the period covered by this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of September
30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that (a) the information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (b) such information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and President and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

(b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 

Except as listed below, there is no action, suit,
or proceeding by any court, public board, government agency, self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the
executive officers of the Company or our subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting the Company, our common stock, our subsidiaries,
or the Company s or its subsidiaries officers or directors in their capacities as such, in which an adverse decision could
have a material adverse effect on the Company. 

BV Advisory v. QCi Appraisal Action 

BV Advisory was purportedly a shareholder of QPhoton, Inc., the predecessor
in interest to QPhoton, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (both referred to as QPhoton in this Legal Proceedings
discussion). On October 13, 2022, BV Advisory filed a petition in the DE Chancery Court seeking appraisal rights (the Appraisal
Petition on the shares of common stock of QPhoton it allegedly owns (which shares represented 10 of the shares of common stock
of QPhoton outstanding immediately prior to the Company s acquisition of QPhoton) pursuant to Section 262 of the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware. The parties agreed to suspend discovery pending resolution of outstanding motions in two related cases.
On July 24, 2024, the DE Chancery Court granted a petition by BV Advisory s legal counsel to withdraw from the case. As of November
4, 2024, BV Advisory has not retained new counsel to represent it on the Appraisal Petition, and the Company does not have sufficient
information to assess the potential impact of the appraisal demand at this time. 

BV Advisory v. QCi Breach Lawsuit 

On March 1, 2021, QPhoton entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with
BV Advisory. Under the Note Purchase Agreement, on March 1, 2021, March 23, 2021 and July 9, 2021, QPhoton and BV Advisory entered into
convertible promissory notes for 200,592, 150,000, and 150,000, respectively, for a total of 500,592 (the BV Notes ).
The BV Notes all bore interest at a rate of 6 per annum and matured two years from the issuance date. On June 16, 2022, the effective
date of our acquisition of QPhoton, QPhoton tendered a cashier s check to BV Advisory in the amount of 535,684.24, representing
the full principal balance of the BV Notes and accrued interest through June 16, 2022. On July 14, 2022, BV Advisory returned the cashier s
check and disputed the calculation of the amount paid to settle the BV Notes. 

On August 16, 2022, BV Advisory filed a complaint in the DE Chancery
Court naming the Company and certain of its directors and officers (among others) as defendants (the Breach Lawsuit ). BV
Advisory Partners, LLC v. Quantum Computing Inc. , et al., C.A. No. 2022-0719-VCG (Del. Ch.). BV Advisory is seeking, among other relief,
monetary damages for an alleged breach of the Note Purchase Agreement between BV Advisory and QPhoton, as well as monetary damages for
alleged breach of an alleged binding letter of intent among Barksdale Global Holdings, LLC BGH ), Inference Ventures, LLC Inference Ventures and QPhoton. BV Advisory and its affiliates claim that pursuant to the letter of intent they had the
right to acquire additional shares in QPhoton by investing 2.5 million in QPhoton. BV Advisory claims QPhoton refused to allow BV Advisory
to purchase the equity. However, BV Advisory never made the additional investment in QPhoton. The Company believes that BV Advisory s
claims have no merit and intends to defend itself vigorously. The Company filed a motion to dismiss most of the Breach Lawsuit, and on
May 28, 2024, the DE Chancery Court dismissed eight of the 10 counts in the BV Advisory complaint. On July 24, 2024, the DE Chancery Court
entered an Order dismissing those eight counts with prejudice. On October 17, 2024, the DE Chancery Court granted a Stipulation and Order
dismissing the two remaining counts of the BV Advisory complaint, subject to BV Advisory s right to elect to transfer the BV Note
claim to DE Superior Court. On October 23, 2024, BV Advisory filed an initial notice of election to transfer its BV Note claim to DE Superior
Court 

As of November 4, 2024, the parties are anticipating
a conference with the DE Chancery Court to discuss a schedule for the Appraisal Petition, pending BV Advisory retaining counsel in that
action. 

QCi v. BV Advisory Defamation Lawsuit 

On December 30, 2022 the Company, QPhoton and
Robert Liscouski (the Quantum Plaintiffs filed suit in the Superior Court of New Jersey (the NJ Court against
Keith Barksdale, Michael Kotlarz, BV Advisory, BGH, Power Analytics Global Corporation PAG ), and Inference Ventures (and
together with Barksdale, Kotlarz, BV Advisory, BGH, and PAG the BV Defendants ), alleging fraud, aiding and abetting fraud,
defamation, and conspiracy to defraud, seeking monetary and injunctive relief (the Defamation Lawsuit ). The Company claims
that the BV Defendants have made numerous public statements defaming the Company and its management in furtherance of a plan to manipulate
the trading prices of the Company s common stock, and that the BV Defendants misrepresented their ownership in QPhoton and conspired
to acquire additional shares of QPhoton at the Company s expense. The BV Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on March
24, 2023, and on June 5, 2023, the NJ Court largely denied the BV Defendants motion. On January 31, 2024, the BV Defendants
filed a motion for reconsideration of their motion to dismiss. On March 7, 2024, the NJ Court issued an order, granting the BV Defendant s
motion dismissing the Company s case on procedural grounds because, according to the NJ Court, the Company can assert its claims
against Defendants in the Delaware courts. The Company filed a motion for reconsideration of the order dismissing the case, which was
argued on April 30, 2024. On May 1, 2024 the NJ Court affirmed its initial order dismissing the case and directed the Company to file
its claims against the BV Defendants in Delaware. The Company is currently evaluating whether it should file the claims in Delaware and
does not have sufficient information at this time to assess the potential impact of the action against the BV Defendants.

BV Advisory Receivership Petition 

On July 27, 2023, BV Advisory and its managing
member, Keith Barksdale, as alleged stockholders of and claimants against the Company, filed a petition in the DE Chancery Court to appoint
a receiver for the Company based on allegations that the Company is insolvent due to purported poor corporate governance and cash management.
The petition also objects to the Company s approach to raising capital. In a related motion, the petitioners also sought expedited
treatment of the petition on July 28, 2023, alleging that they face a threat of irreparable harm. The Company strongly disagrees with
the allegations in the petition. On August 23, 2023, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the petition. The Company s motion to
dismiss and BV Advisory s motion for expedited treatment were argued before the DE Chancery Court on October 11, 2023. The DE Chancery
Court denied BV Advisory s motion to expedite and on May 28, 2024 the DE Chancery Court granted the Company s motion to dismiss
the petition without prejudice. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

We believe there are no changes that constitute
material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed
with the SEC on April 1, 2024. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
and Use of Proceeds. 

There were no unregistered sales of or Company repurchases of the Company s
equity securities during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Item 3. Defaults upon Senior Securities. 

There has been no default in the payment of principal,
interest, sinking or purchase fund installment, or any other material default, with respect to any indebtedness of the Company. 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. 

Not Applicable.

 AMENDMENT 1, DATED AS OF SEPTEMBER 1, 2024, TO EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF JUNE 16, 2022, BY AND BETWEEN QUANTUM COMPUTING INC. AND YUPING HUANG

Exhibit 10.5 

AMENDMENT 1 TO EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT 

Between 

QUANTUM COMPUTING INC. and YUPING
HUANG 

This First Amendment to Employment
Agreement (this First Amendment is made as of the 1st day of September 2024, between Yuping Huang (the Executive and Quantum Computing Inc. (the Company ), and amends in certain respects that certain Employment Agreement dated as of June
16, 2022, between the Executive and the Company (the Original Employment Agreement ). 

1. Amendment
to Section 3.1 . Section 3.1 of the Original Agreement is hereby deleted and replaced in its entirety with the following: 

Salary . Effective September
1, 2024 the Company shall pay Executive hourly rate of One Hundred Ninety-Two Dollars and Thirty One Cents 192.31) payable in twice
monthly installments in accordance with the Company s customary payroll cycle (the Base Rate ). The Base Rate thereafter
shall be subject to annual review and adjustment, as determined by the Board (or the Compensation Committee of the Board) in its sole
discretion, provided, however, that the Base Rate may not be decreased without the Executive s consent unless the compensation payable
to all executives of the Company is also similarly reduced. Gross Wages, defined as hours worked times the Base Rate, shall be used in
lieu of Base Salary, for the purpose of calculating bonus awards. The Executive shall be treated as hourly, exempt under the FLSA and
will receive a W-2 at year end. Executive agrees that this change from salary to hourly payment does not trigger the Termination for Good
Reason provision in Section 5.5. The Company and Executive further agree that this change does not affect the vesting of any stock option
grants. 

2. Amendment
to Section 5.2 . Section 5.2 of the Original Agreement is hereby deleted and replaced in its entirety with the following: 

Voluntary Termination by the
Company, or for Good Reason . In the event that Executive s employment is terminated during the term of this Agreement without
Cause, or by Executive s resignation for Good Reason, and Executive executes a release in favor of the Company substantially in
the form annexed hereto as Exhibit C, not later than 30 days after Executive s employment terminates, and the period in which Executive
is entitled to revoke such release has expired without any such revocation, then the Company shall continue to pay to Executive the Base
Rate in effect immediately prior to such termination for the one-month period following Executive s last day of employment, times
the average weekly hours worked in the eight weeks prior to such termination. In addition, the Company shall continue Executive s
coverage under and its contributions towards Executive s health care, dental, and life insurance benefits on the same basis as immediately
prior to the date of termination, except as provided below, for the six-month period following Executive s last day of employment.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to any overriding laws, the Company shall not be required to provide any health care, dental, or
life insurance benefit otherwise receivable by Executive if Executive is actually covered or becomes covered by an equivalent benefit
(at the same cost to Executive, if any) from another source. Any such benefit made available to Executive shall be reported to the Company. 

3.
 No Other Amendments . The Original Employment Agreement remains in full force and effect and is unamended except as explicitly set
forth in this First Amendment. 

4.
 Counterparts . This First Amendment may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all
of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 

[Remainder of page intentionally
left blank; signature page follows] 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF , each of the Executive and the
Company has executed this First Amendment as of the date first above written.
