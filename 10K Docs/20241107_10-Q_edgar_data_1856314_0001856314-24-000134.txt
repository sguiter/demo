 Founder PSUs 
 During June 2021, the Company established a long-term incentive compensation plan for the Co-Founders, which consists of performance restricted stock-unit awards (the Founder PSUs ), that will be settled in shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan, subject to the satisfaction of both service and market based vesting conditions. 
 The grant date fair value for the Founder PSUs was determined by a Monte Carlo simulation and discounted by the risk-free rate on the grant date and an expected volatility of . The Founder PSUs are estimated to vest over a period, based on the achievement of specified price hurdles of the Company s Class A Common Stock. The specified price hurdles of the Company s Class A Common Stock will be measured on the volume-weighted average price per share for the trailing days during any day period that ends within the applicable measurement period. In June 2021, the Company granted Founder PSUs at a weighted average grant date fair value of . The Company records the expense related to these awards within general and administrative in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, estimated unrecognized expense for Founder PSUs was with such expense to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately years.

 on a pretax income of for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a tax expense o f on a pretax income of f or the three months ended September 30, 2023. This resulted in an effective tax rate of for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company reported a tax expense of on a pretax income of for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a tax expense of on a pretax income of f or the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This resulted in an effective tax rate of fo r the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to fo r the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company's effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the following: (1) the impact of Alclear being a partnership and allocating its taxable results to its non-controlling members, (2) movement in valuation allowance, and (3) the impact of U.S. federal and state taxes in excess of applicable tax attributes (e.g., net operating losses and general business tax credits). The Company paid and , respectively, in estimated income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 
 The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and its territories, Israel, Argentina, and Mexico. The statute of limitations for adjustments to our historic tax obligations will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The tax years for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes open for examination are for the years ending December 31, 2018 and forward. The tax years for foreign jurisdictions open for examination are for the years ending December 31, 2019 and forward. 
 
 Recent U.S. Tax Legislation 
 
 On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act. The Inflation Reduction Act creates a 15 corporate alternative minimum tax on profit of corporations whose average annual adjusted financial statement income for any consecutive three-tax-year period preceding the tax year exceeds 1 billion and is effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. This provision did not have a material impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act creates an excise tax of 1 on the fair market value of net stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased shares of its Class A Common Stock. However, the Company did not record an excise tax as of September 30, 2024 because stock issuances were in excess of repurchases. 
 Tax Receivable Agreement 
 As stated in Note 1, in connection with the IPO, the Company entered into the TRA, which generally provides for payment by the Company to the remaining members of Alclear of of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax and franchise tax that Clear Secure, Inc. actually realizes or is deemed to realize as a result of (i) any increase in tax basis in Alclear s assets resulting from (a) exchanges by Alclear members (or their transferees or other assignees) of Alclear Units (along with the corresponding shares of our Class C Common Stock or Class D Common Stock, as applicable) for shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, as applicable, and purchases of Alclear Units and corresponding shares of Class C Common Stock or Class D Common Stock, as the case may be, from the Alclear members (or their transferees or other assignees) or (b) payments under the TRA, and (ii) tax benefits related to imputed interest deemed arising as a result of payments made under the TRA. The Company will retain the benefit of the remaining of these net cash savings. 
 The TRA liability is calculated by determining the tax basis subject to TRA tax basis and applying a blended tax rate to the basis differences and calculating the iterative impact. The blended tax rate consists of the U.S. federal income tax rate and an assumed combined state and local income tax rate driven by the apportionment factors applicable to each state. Subsequent changes to the measurement of the TRA liability are recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations as a component of other income (expense), net. 
 The Company expects to obtain an increase in the share of the tax basis of its share of the assets of Alclear when Alclear Units are redeemed or exchanged by Alclear Members and other qualifying transactions. This increase in tax basis may have the effect of reducing the amounts that the Company would otherwise pay in the future to various tax authorities. The

 shares of Class A Common Stock to certain non-controlling interest holders who exchanged their Alclear Units. Refer to Note 14 for further details. These exchanges resulted in a tax basis increase subject to the provisions of the TRA. The recognition of the Company s liability under the tax receivable agreement mirrors the recognition related to its deferred tax assets. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not recognized the deferred tax asset for the step-up in tax basis, as the asset is not more-likely-than-not to be realized. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, the Company has determined the TRA liability is not probable and therefore has not recorded a tax receivable liability that, if recorded, would be approximately . 
 
 Tax Distributions 
 
 The members of Alclear, including Clear Secure, Inc., incur U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on their share of any taxable income of Alclear. The Operating Agreement provides for pro rata cash distributions tax distributions to the holders of the Alclear Units in an amount generally calculated to provide each member of Alclear with sufficient cash to cover its tax liability in respect of the taxable income of Alclear allocable to them. In general, these tax distributions are computed based on Alclear s estimated taxable income, multiplied by an assumed tax rate as set forth in the Operating Agreement. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Alclear paid tax distributions totaling to holders of Alclear Units other than the Company, and recorded a liability of to holders of Alclear Units other than other than the Company.

In April 2021, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement that increased the commitments under the revolving credit facility to , which extended the maturity date to March 31, 2024. The revolving credit facility includes a letter of credit sub-facility. In June 2023, the Company entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Credit Agreement to transition from London Interbank Offered Rate to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") as our benchmark interest rate and to extend the maturity date to June 28, 2026.

 Key Factors Affecting Performance 
 We believe that our current and future financial growth are dependent upon many factors, including the key factors affecting performance described below. 
 25 

Table of Contents 

 Ability to Grow Total Cumulative Enrollments 
 We are focused on growing Total Cumulative Enrollments and the number of Members that engage with our platform. Our operating results and growth opportunities depend, in part, on our ability to attract new Members, including paying Members (CLEAR Plus Members) as well as new platform Members. We rely on multiple channels to attract new CLEAR Plus Members, including in-airport (our largest channel) which in turn is dependent on the ongoing ability of our Ambassadors to successfully engage with the traveling public. We also rely on numerous digital channels such as paid search and partnerships. We also entered into strategic distribution partnerships with partners such as Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Alaska Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines and American Express that promote our services to their customers on a discounted or subsidized basis which allows us to efficiently scale membership in CLEAR Plus. In March 2024 we renewed our partnership with American Express for the first of two one year renewal terms. In many cases, we offer limited time free trials to new Members who may convert to paying Members upon the completion of their trial. Our future success is dependent on those channels continuing to drive new Members and our ability to convert free trial Members into paying Members. 
 We believe we will see an acceleration of Total Cumulative Platform Uses relative to Total Cumulative Enrollments over time as our Members use our products across multiple locations and use cases. We believe this dynamic will grow the long-term economic value of our platform by increasing total engagement, expanding our margins and maximizing our revenue. Our future success is dependent upon maintaining and growing our partnerships as well as ensuring our platform remains compelling to Members. 
 Although we have historically grown the number of new Members over time and successfully converted some free trial Members to paying Members, our future success is dependent upon our ongoing ability to do so. 
 Ability to retain CLEAR Plus Members 
 Our ability to execute on our growth strategy is focused, in part, on our ability to retain our existing CLEAR Plus Members. Frequency and recency of usage are the leading indicators of retention, and we must continue to provide frictionless and predictable experiences that our Members will use in their daily lives. We are subject to various factors which may be out of our control and may impact our Member experience, such as checkpoint staffing generally, checkpoint queue configurations and Registered Traveler policies adopted by TSA. For example, the TSA employs varied randomization as part of their normal security processes. If the TSA materially increases randomized reverification rates for CLEAR Plus Members at the checkpoint or makes other adjustments to checkpoint processes, it may negatively impact the Lane experience and therefore may impact our ability to retain CLEAR Plus Members. 
 The value of the CLEAR platform to our Members increases as we add more use cases and partnerships, which in turn drives more frequent usage and increases retention. Historically, CLEAR Plus Members who used CLEAR in both aviation and non-aviation venues renewed at rates materially above those who used CLEAR only in aviation. We cannot be sure that we will be successful in retaining our Members due to any number of factors such as our inability to successfully implement a new product, adoption of our technology, harm to our brand or other factors. 
 Ability to add new partners, retain existing partners and generate new revenue streams 
 Our partners include local airport authorities, airlines and other businesses. Our future success depends on maintaining those relationships, adding new relationships and maintaining favorable business terms. In addition, our growth strategy relies on creating new revenue streams such as per partner, per Member or per use transaction fees. Although we believe our service provides significant value to our partners, our success depends on creating mutually beneficial partnership agreements. We are focused on innovating both our product and our platform to improve our Members experience, improve safety and security and introduce new use cases. We intend to accelerate our pace of innovation to add more features and use cases, to ultimately deliver greater value to our Members and partners. In the near term, we believe that growing our Member base facilitates our ability to add new partnerships and provide additional offerings, which we expect will lead to revenue generation opportunities in the long term. 
 Timing of new partner, product and location launches 
 Our financial performance is dependent in part on new partner, product and location launches. In many cases, we cannot predict the exact timing of those launches. Delays, resulting either from internal or external factors, may have a material effect on our financial results.

 Timing of expenses; Discretionary investments 
 
 Although many of our expenses occur in a predictable fashion, certain expenses may fluctuate from period to period due to timing. 
 In addition, management may make discretionary investments when it sees an opportunity to accelerate growth, add a new partner or acquire talent, among other reasons. This may lead to volatility or unpredictability in our expense base and in our profitability. 
 Maintaining strong unit economics 
 Our business model is powered by network effects and has historically been characterized by efficient Member acquisition and high Member retention rates. While we believe our unit economics will remain attractive, this is dependent on our ability to add new Members efficiently and maintain our historically strong retention rates. As we grow our market penetration, the cost to acquire new Members could increase and the experience we deliver to Members could degrade, causing lower retention rates. For our definitions of Lifetime Value and Customer Acquisition Cost and information about how we calculate these metrics, see the section titled Business Our Member Acquisition and Retention Strategy in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Changes to the macro environment 
 Our business is dependent on macroeconomic and other events outside of our control, such as decreased levels of travel or attendance at events, terrorism, civil unrest, political instability, union and other transit related strikes and other general economic conditions. We are also subject to changes in discretionary consumer spending. 
 
 Taxation and Expenses 
 After the consummation of our IPO, we became subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes with respect to our allocable share of any taxable income of Alclear and will be taxed at the prevailing corporate tax rates. Alclear is treated as flow-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and as such, has generally not been subject to U.S. federal income tax at the entity level. Accordingly, the historical results of operations and other financial information set forth in the Annual Report on Form 10-K do not include any material provisions for U.S. federal income tax for the periods prior to our IPO. 
 In addition to tax expense, we incur expenses related to our operations, plus payments under the tax receivable agreement TRA described below, which we expect to be significant. We intend to cause Alclear to make distributions in an amount sufficient to allow us to pay our tax obligations and operating expenses, including distributions to fund any ordinary course payments under the TRA. 
 Following our IPO, we have and we expect to continue to incur increased amounts of compensation expense, including related to equity awards granted under the 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan to both existing employees and newly-hired employees, and grants in connection with new hires could be significant. In addition, as a new public company, we are implementing additional procedures and processes for the purpose of addressing the standards and requirements applicable to public companies. We expect to incur additional expenses related to these steps and, among other things, additional directors and officers liability insurance, director fees, reporting requirements of the SEC, transfer agent fees, hiring additional accounting, legal and administrative personnel, increased auditing and legal fees and similar expenses. 
 
 Tax Receivable Agreement 
 In connection with the IPO we entered into the TRA with the Alclear Members that provides for the payment by us to the Alclear Members of 85 of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that we actually realize (computed using simplifying assumptions to address the impact of state and local taxes) as a result of (i) any increase in tax basis in Alclear s assets resulting from (a) exchanges by the Alclear Members (or their transferees or other assignees) of Alclear Units (along with the corresponding shares of our Class C Common Stock or Class D Common Stock, as applicable) for shares of our Class A common stock, 0.00001 par value per share Class A Common Stock or Class B common stock, 0.00001 par value per share Class B Common Stock as applicable, and purchases of Alclear Units and corresponding shares of Class C common stock, par value 0.00001 per share Class C Common Stock or Class D common stock, 0.00001 par value per share Class D Common Stock and, together with the Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock and Class C Common Stock, collectively, Common Stock ), as the case may be, from Alclear Members (or

 their transferees or other assignees) or (b) payments under the TRA, and (ii) tax benefits related to imputed interest deemed arising as a result of payments made under the TRA. 
 The actual increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under these agreements, varies depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of exchanges by or purchases from the Alclear Members, the price of our Class A Common Stock at the time of the exchange, the extent to which such exchanges are taxable, the amount and timing of the taxable income we generate in the future and the tax rate then applicable and the portion of our payments under the TRA constituting imputed interest. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized certain exchanges. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not record a TRA liability as a result of these exchanges. 
 
 Key Performance Indicators 
 To evaluate performance of the business, we utilize a variety of other non-GAAP financial reporting and performance measures. These key measures include Total Bookings, Total Cumulative Enrollments, Total Cumulative Platform Uses, Annual CLEAR Plus Net Member Retention, Annual CLEAR Plus Gross Dollar Retention, Active CLEAR Plus Members, and Annual CLEAR Plus Member Usage. 
 
 Total Bookings 
 Total Bookings represent our total revenue plus the change in deferred revenue during the period. Total Bookings in any particular period reflect sales to new and renewing CLEAR Plus subscribers plus any accrued billings to partners. Management believes that Total Bookings is an important measure of the current health and growth of the business and views it as a leading indicator. 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change Total Bookings (in millions) 227.5 191.7 35.8 19 605.0 516.5 88.5 17 
 Total Bookings increased by 35.8 million, or 19 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by new Member enrollments and pricing increases. 
 Total Bookings increased by 88.5 million, or 17 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by new Member enrollments and pricing increases. 
 Total Cumulative Enrollments 
 We define Total Cumulative Enrollments as the number of enrollments since inception as of the end of the period. An Enrollment is defined as any Member who has registered for the CLEAR platform since inception and has a profile (including limited time free trials regardless of conversion to paid membership) net of duplicate and/or purged accounts. This includes CLEAR Plus Members who have completed enrollment with CLEAR and have ever activated a payment method, plus associated family accounts. Management views this metric as an important tool to analyze the efficacy of our growth and marketing initiatives as new Members are potentially a current and leading indicator of revenues. 
 As of September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Total Cumulative Enrollments (in thousands) 26,453 18,594 7,859 42 
 Total Cumulative Enrollments were 26,453 as of September 30, 2024 and 18,594 as of September 30, 2023, which represented a 42 increase. The year-over-year increase was driven by CLEAR Verified and CLEAR Plus enrollments. 
 Total Cumulative Platform Uses 
 We define Total Cumulative Platform Uses as the number of individual engagements across CLEAR use cases, including CLEAR Plus, our flagship app and CLEAR Verified, since inception as of the end of the period. Management views this metric as an important tool to analyze the level of engagement of our Member base which can be a leading indicator of future growth, retention and revenue.

Table of Contents 

 As of September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Total Cumulative Platform Uses (in thousands) 220,413 167,417 52,996 32 
 Total Cumulative Platform Uses was 220,413 as of September 30, 2024 and 167,417 as of September 30, 2023, which represented a 32 increase, driven by CLEAR Plus verifications combined with increased contributions from CLEAR Verified uses. 
 
 Active CLEAR Plus Members 
 We define Active CLEAR Plus Members as the number of members with an active CLEAR Plus subscription as of the end of the period. This includes CLEAR Plus members who have an activated payment method, plus associated family accounts and is inclusive of members who are in a limited time free trial or in a billing grace period after a billing failure during which time we attempt to collect payment; we exclude duplicate and/or purged accounts. Management views this as an important tool to measure the growth of its CLEAR Plus product. 
 As of September 30, 2024 2023 Change Active CLEAR Plus Members 7,150 6,374 12 
 Annual CLEAR Plus Gross Dollar Retention 
 We define Annual CLEAR Plus Gross Dollar Retention as the net bookings collected from a Fixed Cohort of Members during the Current Period as a percentage of the net bookings collected from the same Fixed Cohort during the Prior Period. The Current Period is the 12-month period ending on the reporting date, the Prior Period is the 12-month period ending on the reporting date one year earlier. The Fixed Cohort is defined as all Active CLEAR Plus Members as of the last day of the Prior Period who have activated a payment method for our in-airport CLEAR Plus service, including their registered family plan Members. Bookings received from a third party as part of a partnership agreement are excluded from both periods. Active CLEAR Plus Members, including those on a free or discounted plan, or who receive a full statement credit, only impact Annual CLEAR Plus Gross Dollar Retention to the extent that they are paying anything out-of-pocket on behalf of themselves or a registered family plan Member. Management views this metric to be reflective of our business objective of optimizing revenue and less dependent upon the underlying growth rate of the total membership base. 
 As of September 30, 2024 2023 Change Annual CLEAR Plus Gross Dollar Retention 89.0 88.0 1.0 
 Annual CLEAR Plus Gross Dollar Retention was 89.0 as of September 30, 2024 and 88.0 as of September 30, 2023, a year-over-year increase of 100 basis points. The year-over-year change was driven by pricing increases offset in part by modest decreases in Member retention. 
 Annual CLEAR Plus Net Member Retention 
 We define Annual CLEAR Plus Net Member Retention as one minus the CLEAR Plus net Member churn on a rolling 12 month basis. We define CLEAR Plus net Member churn as total cancellations net of winbacks in the trailing 12 month period divided by the average Active CLEAR Plus Members as of the beginning of each month within the same 12 month period. Winbacks are defined as reactivated Members who have been cancelled for at least 60 days. Management views this metric as an important tool to analyze the level of engagement of our Member base, which can be a leading indicator of future growth and revenue, as well as an indicator of customer satisfaction and long term business economics. 
 As of September 30, 2024 2023 Change Annual CLEAR Plus Net Member Retention 81.5 88.5 (7.0 
 Annual CLEAR Plus Net Member Retention was 81.5 as of September 30, 2024 and 88.5 as of September 30, 2023, a year-over year decrease of 700 basis points. The decrease was primarily driven by a larger pool of Members up for renewal year-over-year, a normalization of winbacks and the modest impact of various pricing increases.

 Annual CLEAR Plus Member Usage 
 We define Annual CLEAR Plus Member Usage as the total number of unique CLEAR Plus airport verifications in the 365 days prior to the end of the period divided by active CLEAR Plus Members as of the end of the period who have been enrolled for at least 365 days. The numerator includes only verifications of the population in the denominator. Management views this as an important tool to analyze the level of engagement of our active CLEAR Plus Member base.

 Annual Usage was 7.1x as of September 30, 2024 and 8.5x as of September 30, 2023, which represented a 16 decrease. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 In addition to our results as determined in accordance with GAAP, we disclose Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Common Share, Basic and Diluted as non-GAAP financial measures that management believes provide useful information to investors. These measures are not financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net income, net cash provided by (used in) operating activities or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure reported by other companies. Our Non-GAAP financial measures are expressed in thousands. 
 
 We periodically reassess the components of our Non-GAAP adjustments for changes in how we evaluate our performance and changes in how we make financial and operational decisions to ensure the adjustments remain relevant and meaningful. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income adjusted for income taxes, interest (income) expense net, depreciation and amortization, impairment and losses on asset disposals, equity-based compensation expense, mark to market of warrant liabilities, net other income (expense) excluding sublease rental income, acquisition-related costs and changes in fair value of contingent consideration. Adjusted EBITDA is an important financial measure used by management and our board of directors Board to evaluate business performance. We believe Adjusted EBITDA assists investors in evaluating the performance of the Company s core operations by excluding certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to period. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, we revised our definition of Adjusted EBITDA to exclude sublease rental income from our other income (expense) adjustment. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, we revised our definition of Adjusted EBITDA to include impairment on assets as a separate component. We did not revise prior years' Adjusted EBITDA because there was no impact of a similar nature in the prior period that affects comparability. Adjusted EBITDA margin is adjusted EBITDA, divided by total revenues. 
 
 Adjusted Net Income 
 
 We define Adjusted Net Income as net income attributable to Clear Secure, Inc. adjusted for the net income attributable to non-controlling interests, equity-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related costs, changes in fair value of contingent consideration and the income tax effect of these adjustments, using an effective tax rate. We believe these adjustments assist investors in evaluating the performance of the Company s core operations assuming the exchange of all vested and outstanding common units in Alclear. In addition, this measure, while not necessarily calculated in the same way as similarly titled measures used by other companies, facilitates comparisons with other companies that have different organizational and tax structures. Adjusted Net Income is used in the calculation of Adjusted Net Income per Common Share as defined below.

Table of Contents 

Adjusted Net Income per Common Share 
 
 We compute Adjusted Net Income per Common Share, Basic as Adjusted Net Income divided by Adjusted Weighted-Average Shares Outstanding for our Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock, Class C Common Stock and Class D Common Stock assuming the exchange of all vested and outstanding common units in Alclear at the end of each period presented. We do not present Adjusted Net Income per Common Share for shares of our Class B Common Stock although they are participating securities based on the assumed conversion of those shares to our Class A Common Stock. We do not present Adjusted Net Income per Common Share on a dilutive basis for periods where we have Adjusted Net Income since we do not assume the conversion of any potentially dilutive equity instruments as the result would be anti-dilutive. In periods where we have Adjusted Net Income, the Company also calculates Adjusted Net Income per Common Share, Diluted based on the effect of potentially dilutive equity instruments for the periods presented using the treasury stock/if-converted method, as applicable. 
 
 Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Common Share exclude, to the extent applicable, the tax effected impact of non-cash expenses and other items that are not directly related to our core operations. These items are excluded because they are connected to the Company s long term growth plan and not intended to increase short term revenue in a specific period. We believe these adjustments assist investors in evaluating the performance of the Company s core operations assuming the exchange of all vested and outstanding common units in Alclear. Further, to the extent that other companies use similar methods in calculating non-GAAP measures, the provision of supplemental non-GAAP information can allow for a comparison of the Company s relative performance against other companies that also report non-GAAP operating results. 
 
 Free Cash Flow 
 
 We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities adjusted for purchases of property and equipment. We believe Free Cash Flow provides useful information to management and investors about the Company s liquidity and cash flow trends. With regards to our CLEAR Plus subscription service, we generally collect cash from our members upfront for annual subscriptions. As a result, when the business is growing Free Cash Flow can be a real time indicator of the current trajectory of the business. 
 See below for reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP measures.

 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 The Company derives substantially all of its revenue from subscriptions to its consumer aviation service, CLEAR Plus. The Company offers certain limited-time free trials, family pricing, and other beneficial pricing through several channels, including airline and credit card partnerships. Membership subscription revenue is presented net of taxes, refunds, credit card chargebacks, and estimated amounts due to a credit card partner. Membership subscription revenue is also reduced by the Company s funded portion of credit card benefits issued to Members through a partnership with a credit card company at the end of the contract period. The Company s funded portion varies based on total number of Members for the contract year. 
 
 The Company also generates revenue in relation to CLEAR Verified. While contract structure may vary by use case, these deals are typically multi-year, recurring contracts that drive revenue primarily through transaction fees charged either per use or per user over a predefined time period, which sometimes includes tiered pricing. In addition, they may also include one-time implementation fees, licensing fees or incremental transaction fees. Revenues from our partners, and the percentage of our total revenue from these partners, have historically been immaterial. 
 
 The Company generates additional revenue from TSA PreCheck Enrollment Provided by CLEAR. The Company offers consumers increased choice in how and where to sign up for this popular trusted traveler program through both online and in person enrollments and renewals across multiple locations. The Company continues to launch additional locations on a rolling basis, subject to TSA approval. The Company recognizes the revenue from these services net of fees remitted to TSA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation within the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company recognizes these revenues on a per transaction basis upon completion of each enrollment or renewal.

Income tax expense increased by 4.0 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 . The change was primarily due to the U.S. federal and state current taxes not offset by tax attributes (e.g. net operating losses and general business tax credits). 
 
 Income tax expense increased by 6.3 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily due to the U.S. federal and state current taxes not offset by tax attributes (e.g. net operating losses and general business tax credits). 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our operations have been financed primarily through cash flows from operating activities. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 32.9 million and marketable securities of 511.8 million. 
 Historically, our principal uses of cash and cash equivalents have included funding our operations, capital expenditures, repurchases of members equity and more recently, business combinations and investments that enhance our strategic positioning. We may also use our cash and cash equivalents to repurchase our Class A Common Stock, pay cash dividends and distribute to members for tax payments. We plan to finance our operations, future stock repurchases, cash dividends and capital expenditures largely through cash generated from operations. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash provided by operations and the availability of additional funds under our Credit Agreement (as defined below) will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months, including payment of dividends, potential stock repurchases, and known commitments and contingencies as discussed below. We expect that future capital expenditure will generally relate to building enhancements to the functionality of our current platform, equipment, leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures related to office expansion and relocation, and general corporate infrastructure. 
 Share Repurchases 
 On May 13, 2022, the Company's Board authorized a share repurchase program pursuant to which the Company may purchase up to 100 million of its Class A Common Stock. On November 8, 2023, March 21, 2024 and August 5, 2024, the Company announced that its Board authorized three 100 million increases to its existing Class A Common Stock share repurchase program, resulting in an aggregate remaining authorization on August 5, 2024 of approximately 100.5 million. Under the repurchase program, the Company may purchase shares of its Class A Common Stock on a discretionary basis from time to time through open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, or other means, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will be determined by management depending on a variety of factors, including stock price, trading volume, market conditions, and other general business considerations. The repurchase program has no expiration date and may be modified, suspended, or terminated at any time. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 11,983,612 shares for 225.2 million. The repurchased shares were retired. As of September 30, 2024, 100.5 million remained available under the repurchase authorization. 
 Dividends 
 On May 9, 2023, the Company announced that a special committee of its Board declared a special cash dividend in the amount of 0.20 per share payable on May 25, 2023 to holders of record of the Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock as of the close of business on May 18, 2023. The Company funded the payment of the special cash dividend from its pro rata share of tax distributions made by Alclear.

Table of Contents 

 On August 2, 2023, the Company announced that our Board adopted a dividend policy (the "Dividend Policy") of paying a quarterly cash dividend to holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. The amount of such quarterly dividends are subject to approval of the actual amount by the Board at the time of such dividend declaration. It is expected that the dividends will be funded by proportionate cash distributions by Alclear to all of its members as of the applicable record date, including holders of non-controlling interests in Alclear and the Company. The declaration of cash dividends in the future is subject to final determination each quarter by the Board based on a number of factors, including the Company s results of operations, cash flows, financial position and capital requirements, as well as general business conditions, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions and other factors the Board deems relevant at the time it determines to declare such dividends. 
 
 On February 15, 2024, the Company announced that its Board declared a quarterly dividend of 0.09 per share, payable on March 5, 2024 to holders of record of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock as of the close of business on February 26, 2024. The Company funded the dividend from proportionate cash distributions by Alclear to all of its members as of February 26, 2024, including holders of non-controlling interests in Alclear and the Company. 
 On March 21, 2024, the Company announced the declaration of a special cash dividend in the amount of 0.32 per share payable on April 8, 2024 to holders of record of the Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock as of the close of business on April 1, 2024. The Company funded the payment of the special cash dividend with cash held by the Company following its receipt of a pro rata cash distribution made by Alclear to all of its members, including the Company, together with cash held by the Company following its receipt of tax distributions made by Alclear. Tax distributions are required under Alclear s Operating Agreement, generally at a tax rate higher than the Company's. As a result, together with the Company s utilization of certain tax attributes, the Company has received cash from tax distributions in excess of what is required to fund its tax liabilities and obligations under its Tax Receivable Agreement. 
 
 On May 7, 2024, the Company announced that its Board declared a quarterly dividend of 0.10 per share, payable on June 18, 2024 to holders of record of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock as of the close of business on June 10, 2024. The Company funded the dividend from proportionate cash distributions by Alclear to all of its members as of June 10, 2024, including holders of non-controlling interests in Alclear and the Company. 
 
 On August 2, 2024, the Company announced that its Board declared a quarterly dividend of 0.10 per share, payable on September 17, 2024 to holders of record of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock as of the close of business on September 10, 2024. The Company funded the dividend from proportionate cash distributions by Alclear to all of its members as of September 10, 2024, including holders of non-controlling interests in Alclear and the Company. 
 
 On October 31, 2024, the Company announced that its Board declared a quarterly dividend of 0.125 per share, payable on December 17, 2024 to holders of record of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock as of the close of business on December 10, 2024 (the Record Date ). The Company will fund the dividends from proportionate cash distributions by Alclear to all of its members as of the Record Date, including holders of non-controlling interests in Alclear and the Company. 
 
 To the extent the quarterly or special dividends exceed the Company's current and accumulated earnings and profits, a portion of such dividends may be deemed a return of capital gain to the holders of our Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, as applicable. 
 
 Refer to our risks and uncertainties discussed under the heading "Forward-Looking Statements" and in Part II. Item 1A. "Risk Factors." 
 Credit Agreement 
 On March 31, 2020, we entered into a credit agreement (as amended, restated or otherwise modified, the Credit Agreement for a three-year 50 million revolving credit facility that expires on March 31, 2023. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement generally bear interest between 1.5 and 2.5 per year and also include interest based on the greater of the prime rate, London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR or New York Federal Reserve Bank NYFRB rate, plus an applicable margin for specific interest periods. In April 2021, the Company increased the size of the revolving credit facility to 100 million, which matures three years from the date of the increase. The revolving credit facility includes a letter of credit sub-facility. In June 2023, the Company entered into a second amendment to the Credit Agreement to transition from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") as our benchmark interest rate and to extend the maturity date to June 28, 2026. 
 39 

Table of Contents 

We have the option to repay any borrowings under the Credit Agreement without premium or penalty prior to maturity. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains certain other covenants (none of which relate to financial condition), events of default and other customary provisions. The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, such as financial statement reporting requirements and delivery of borrowing base certificates, as well as customary covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, sell certain assets, guarantee obligations of third parties, declare dividends or make certain distributions, and undergo a merger or consolidation or certain other transactions. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a remaining borrowing capacity of 67.8 million, net of standby letters of credit, and had no outstanding debt obligations. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all of the financial and non-financial covenants of the Credit Agreement. Refer to Note 21 within the condensed consolidated financial statements for further details. 
 
 Cash Flow 
 The following summarizes our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in millions): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Net cash provided by operating activities 159.1 130.9 28.2 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 148.0 (27.4) 175.3 Net cash used in financing activities (333.2) (103.9) (229.3) Net increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (26.1) (0.4) (25.8) Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, beginning of year 62.4 68.9 (6.5) Net exchange differences on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 0.1 Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, end of period 36.3 68.6 (32.3) 
 Cash flows from operating activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 159.1 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 130.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 28.2 million primarily due to year-over-year increase of net income of 82.1 million offset by a decrease in non-cash adjustments to net income of 3.1 million and unfavorable changes to working capital of 50.8 million, driven by the settlement of accrued partnership liabilities. 
 
 Cash flows from investing activities 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 net cash provided by investing activities was 148.0 compared to net cash used in investing activities of 27.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 175.3 million. The change was primarily due to an increase in the net sales of marketable securities of 154.2 million, a decrease in the purchase of a strategic investment of 5.0 million, decrease in business combinations of 3.8 million, and a decrease in capital expenditures of 12.5 million. 
 
 Cash flows from financing activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was 333.2 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of 103.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 229.3 million. The change was due to increases in the amounts used to repurchase Class A Common Stock of 169.0 million, payments of special and regular dividends of 31.6 million, 2.0 million in payments of taxes on net settled stock-based awards, and distributions to members of 26.8 million.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission SEC has defined a company s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Refer to Note 2 within the condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. 
 
 Tax Receivable Agreement 
 
 The Company entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement TRA which generally provides for payment by the Company to the remaining members of Alclear, the TRA Holders, of 85 of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax and franchise tax that the Company actually realizes or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances. The Company will retain the benefit of the remaining 15 of these net cash savings. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not record a liability from the TRA. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 Refer to Note 2 within the condensed consolidated financial statements, for recently issued accounting pronouncements and their expected impact. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk 
 In the normal course of business, we are subject to a variety of risks which can affect our operations and profitability. We broadly define these areas of risk and interest rate risk. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We had cash and cash equivalents of 32.9 million as of September 30, 2024. Cash and cash equivalents includes highly liquid securities that have a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase. The fair value of our cash and cash equivalents would not be significantly affected by either a 10 increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short-term nature of these instruments. 
 
 We manage cash and cash equivalents in various institutions at levels beyond federally insured limits per institution, and we may purchase investments not guaranteed by the FDIC. Accordingly, there is a risk that we will not recover the full principal of our investments or that their liquidity may be diminished 
 
 Debt 
 
 Interest payable on our revolving credit facility is variable. Borrowings generally will bear interest based on the greater of the prime rate, SOFR or NYFRB rate, plus an applicable margin for specific interest periods. As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. 
 
 Investments in Marketable Securities 
 
 41 

Table of Contents 

 We had marketable securities totaling 511.8 million as of September 30, 2024. This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, commercial paper, corporate notes and bonds, and government securities. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes and we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates where a decline in interest rates would reduce our interest income, net and conversely, an increase in interest rates would have an adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio. The effect of a hypothetical 100 basis points increase or decrease in overall interest rate would result in unrealized loss or gain to our available for sale investment fair value of approximately 3.3 million that would be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss within the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 Foreign Currency Transaction and Translation Risk 
 
 Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets, liabilities, revenues, operating expenses and cash flows that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. dollars. Since the majority of our business is transacted in the U.S. dollar, foreign currency transaction and translation risk was insignificant for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the quarter ended September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, with the Company have been detected. 
 Changes in Internal Control 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, the Company is subject to commercial litigation claims and various legal proceedings, as well as administrative and regulatory reviews arising in the ordinary course of business. We currently believe that the ultimate outcome of such lawsuits, proceedings and reviews will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 We have disclosed under the heading Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K the risk factors which materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed. You should carefully consider the risk factors set forth in the Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other information set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. You should be aware that these risk factors and other information may not describe every risk facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, certain non-controlling interest holders exchanged their Alclear Units and corresponding shares of Class C Common Stock or Class D Common Stock for shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, as applicable. As a result, the Company issued 13,264,336 shares of Class A Common Stock, inclusive of shares of Class B Common Stock exchanged for Class A Common Stock. 
 Use of IPO Proceeds 
 
 On July 2, 2021, we closed our IPO, in which the Company issued 15,180,000 shares of Class A Common Stock (which included 1,980,000 shares of Class A Common Stock as a result of the exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option, which was exercised on June 30, 2021). All shares in the IPO were registered under the Securities Act pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-256851), which was declared effective by the SEC on June 29, 2021 (the Registration Statement ). 
 
 Goldman Sachs Co. was the representative of the underwriters, which comprised Goldman Sachs Co., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Allen Company LLC, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, LionTree Advisors LLC, Stifel, Nicolaus Company, Incorporated, Telsey Advisory Group LLC, Centerview Partners LLC, Loop Capital Markets LLC, and Roberts Ryan Investments, Inc. The lead book-runners of our IPO were Goldman Sachs Co. LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Allen Company LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC. 
 
 The initial offering price to the public in the IPO was 31.00 per share. We received 29.295 per share from the underwriters after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of 1.705 per share. We incurred underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately 25.9 million, including the effect of the exercise of the over-allotment option. Thus, our net offering proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, net of the rebate on the over-allotment option, were approximately 445.9 million, which the Company contributed to Alclear in exchange for 15,180,000 Alclear Units. The Company has caused Alclear to use such contributed amount to pay offering expenses of approximately 9.0 million, and for general corporate purposes. There has been no material change in the planned use of the IPO net proceeds from what is described in the Company s Registration Statement. No payments were made to our directors or officers or their associates, holders of 10 or more of any class of our equity securities or any affiliates.
