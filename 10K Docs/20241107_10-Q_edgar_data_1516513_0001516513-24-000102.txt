 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which are statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as may, will, shall, should, expects, plans, anticipates, could, intends, target, projects, contemplates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential, or continue or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include, but are not limited to, statements about: 
 our expectations regarding our revenue, expenses, and other operating results; 
 our future financial performance; 
 our expectations and management of future growth; 
 our ability to acquire new members and successfully retain existing members; 
 our ability to acquire new customers and successfully retain existing customers; 
 our ability to achieve or maintain our profitability; 
 future investments in our business, our anticipated capital expenditures, and our estimates regarding our capital requirements; 
 the costs and success of our sales and marketing efforts, and our ability to promote our brand; 
 our ability to effectively manage our growth, including our ability to identify, retain, and recruit personnel, and maintain our culture; 
 our ability to comply with laws and regulations;

 our ability to comply with modified or new laws and regulations applying to our business; 
 our ability to successfully identify, acquire, and integrate companies and assets; 
 developments and projections relating to our competitors and our industry, including competing solutions; 
 impact from future regulatory, judicial, and legislative changes or developments that may affect our customers or our business; and 
 the risks related to our Class A common stock and our dual class common stock structure. 
 We caution you that the foregoing list may not contain all of the forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Table of Contents 

 You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors described in the section titled Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the SEC, on May 23, 2024, and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as in our other filings with the SEC. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The results, events, and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur, and actual results, events, or circumstances could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. 
 The forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions, or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures, or investments we may make. 
 In addition, statements that we believe and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based upon information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain and you are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements.

 months or less. Customers are generally billed for a portion of the contract upon contract execution and then billed throughout the remainder of the contract based on various time-based milestones. Certain Marketing Solutions contracts are cancelable with a customary notice period. The Company does not refund customer payments, and customers are responsible for amounts invoiced where payment was not made upon cancellation. The contractual term for Hiring Solutions contracts is generally months. Hiring Solutions contracts are noncancelable and customers are billed in annual, quarterly, or monthly installments in advance of the service period. 
 2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract 
 Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. 
 Marketing Solutions customers may purchase a subscription for a specific module to be used over a defined period of time. These customers may purchase more than one module with either the same or different subscription periods. Modules are the core building blocks of the customers marketing plan and can be broadly categorized as Awareness, Interactivity, and Peer. As an example, the Company s Awareness modules may include a sponsored article, short animated videos or other short-form content that is presented to the targeted member. 
 Each module targets a consistent number of Doximity members per month for the duration of the subscription period. The Company treats each subscription to a specific module as a distinct performance obligation because each module is capable of being distinct as the customer can benefit from the subscription to each module on their own and each subscription can be sold standalone. Furthermore, the subscriptions to individual modules are distinct in the context of the contract as (1) the Company is not integrating the services with other services promised in the contract into a bundle of services that represent a combined output, (2) the subscriptions to specific modules do not significantly modify or customize the subscription to another module, and (3) the specific modules are not highly interdependent or highly interrelated. The subscription to each module is treated as a series of distinct performance obligations because it is distinct and substantially the same, satisfied over time, and has the same measure of progress. 
 Marketing Solutions customers may also purchase integrated subscriptions for a fixed subscription fee that are not tied to a single module but allow customers to utilize any combination of modules during the subscription period, subject to limits on the total number of modules launched in a given period of time, active at any given time, and members targeted. These represent stand-ready obligations in that the delivery of the underlying sponsored content is within the control of the customer and the extent of use in any given period does not diminish the remaining services. 
 Subscriptions to Hiring Solutions provide customers access to the platform to place targeted job postings and send a fixed number of monthly messages. Each subscription is treated as a series of distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time. 
 3) Determine the transaction price 
 The transaction price is determined based on the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring services to the customer. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in the Company s judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue recognized under the contract will not occur. 
 The Company may generate sales through the use of third-party media agencies that are authorized to enter into contracts on behalf of an end customer. The Company acts as the principal in these transactions since it maintains control prior to transferring the service to the customer and is primarily responsible for the fulfillment that occurs through the Company s platform. The Company records revenue for the amount to which it is entitled from the third-party media agencies as the Company does not know and expects not to know the price charged by the third-party media agencies to its customers.

 Other Total revenue 
 Contract Balances 
 Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. Marketing Solutions customers are generally billed for a portion of the contract upon contract execution and then billed throughout the remainder of the contract based on various time-based milestones, starting when the tailored content is first shared on the Doximity platform. Hiring Solutions customers are generally billed periodically throughout the service period. The Company s contracts do not contain significant financing components.

 million and million as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. 
 Deferred revenue consists of noncancelable customer billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition. Deferred revenue balances are generally expected to be recognized within months. Since the majority of the Company s contracts have a duration of one year or less, the Company has elected not to disclose remaining performance obligations in accordance with the optional exemption in ASC 606. Remaining performance obligations for contracts with an original duration greater than one year are not material. 
 Revenue recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 from amounts included in deferred revenue as of the beginning of the period was million and million, respectively. Revenue recognized for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 from amounts included in deferred revenue as of the beginning of the period was million and million, respectively. 
 Deferred Contract Costs 
 The Company capitalizes sales compensation that is considered to be an incremental and recoverable cost of obtaining a contract with a customer. The Company pays commissions based on signing new arrangements with customers and upon renewals and expansion of existing contracts with customers. 
 Deferred compensation is generally amortized over the weighted-average contractual term, ranging from months to months. The portion of deferred compensation expected to be recognized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and the remaining portion is recorded as other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The amortization of deferred contract costs is included in sales and marketing expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Sales compensation that is not considered an incremental cost is expensed in the same period that it was earned. 
 The Company capitalized million and million of contract acquisition costs for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and million and million of contract acquisition costs for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023. Amortization of deferred contract costs was million and million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and million and million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s current and non-current deferred contract cost balances were million and million, respectively. As of March 31, 2024, the Company s current and non-current deferred contract cost balances were million and million, respectively.

 Impairment Charge 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company executed a sublease for a portion of its Curative office space in Irving, Texas. The Company evaluated the associated asset group for impairment, which included the right-of-use assets and underlying property and equipment for the lease. The Company compared the expected future undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value and determined the respective asset group was not fully recoverable. The Company calculated the fair value based on the present value of the estimated cash flows from the sublease for the remaining lease term and compared the estimated fair value to its carrying value, which resulted in a million impairment charge. The fair value of the operating lease right-of-use assets and associated property and equipment was estimated as of the sublease execution date using level 3

 Overview 
 We are the leading digital platform for U.S. medical professionals, as measured by the number of members. Our members include more than 80 of U.S. physicians, spanning all 50 states and every medical specialty. 
 Our mission is to help every physician be more productive and provide better care for their patients. We are physicians-first, putting technology to work for doctors instead of the other way around. That guiding principle has enabled Doximity to become an essential and trusted professional platform for physicians. Our physician cloud puts modern software in the hands of physicians and other medical professionals, enabling our members to collaborate with colleagues, stay up to date with the latest medical news and research, manage their careers and on-call schedules, streamline documentation and administrative paperwork, and conduct virtual patient visits. Our revenue-generating customers, primarily pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare systems, have access to a suite of commercial solutions that benefit from broad physician usage. 
 At the core of our platform is the largest medical professional network in the nation, which creates proximity within our community of doctors and hundreds of thousands of other medical professionals. Verified members can search and connect with colleagues and specialists, which allows them to better coordinate patient care and streamline referrals. Our newsfeed addresses the ever increasing sub-specialization of medical expertise and volume of medical research by delivering news and information that is relevant to each physician's clinical practice. We also support physicians in their day-to-day practice of medicine with mobile-friendly and easy-to-use productivity tools such as voice and video dialer, secure messaging, digital faxing, and Doximity GPT. Our business model is designed to both respect and support physicians while driving value for our customers through our Marketing, Hiring, and Productivity Solutions. Our revenue-generating customers, primarily pharmaceutical manufacturers and health systems, have access to a suite of commercial solutions that benefit from broad physician usage. 
 Our business model has delivered high revenue growth at scale with profitability. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized revenue of 136.8 million and 113.6 million, respectively, representing a year-over-year growth rate of 20 . For the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized revenue of 263.5 million and 222.1 million, respectively, representing a year-over-year growth rate of 19 . For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our net income was 44.2 million and 30.6 million and our adjusted EBITDA was 76.1 million and 54.2 million, respectively. For the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our net income was 85.5 million and 59.0 million and our adjusted EBITDA was 142.1 million and 100.7 million, respectively. We have accomplished this while focusing on our core mission to help every physician be more productive and provide better care for their patients.

 Key Business and Financial Metrics 
 We monitor a number of key business and financial metrics to assess the health and success of our business, including: 
 Customers with Trailing 12-Month Subscription Revenue Greater than 500,000. The number of customers with trailing 12-month TTM subscription revenue greater than 500,000 is a key indicator of the scale of our business, and is calculated by counting the number of customers that contributed more than 500,000 in subscription revenue in the TTM period. Our customer count is subject to adjustments for acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity, and we present our total customer count for historical periods reflecting these adjustments. 
 The number of customers with at least 500,000 of revenue has grown steadily in recent years as we have engaged new customers and expanded within existing ones. This cohort of customers accounted for approximately 83 of our revenue for the TTM ended September 30, 2024. 
 September 30, 2024 2023 Number of customers with at least 500,000 of revenue 
 103 92 
 Net Revenue Retention Rate. Net revenue retention rate is calculated by taking the TTM subscription-based revenue from our customers that had revenue in the prior TTM period and dividing that by the total subscription-based revenue for the prior TTM period. For the purposes of this calculation, subscription revenue excludes subscriptions for individuals and small practices and other non-recurring items. Our net revenue retention rate compares our subscription revenue from the same set of customers across comparable periods, and reflects customer renewals, expansion, contraction, and churn. Our net revenue retention rate is directly tied to our revenue growth rate and thus fluctuates as that growth rate fluctuates. 
 September 30, 2024 2023 Net revenue retention rate 116 114 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We use adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow to measure our performance, identify trends, formulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 We define adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization, and as further adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, restructuring and impairment charge, change in fair value of contingent earn-out consideration liability, and other income, net. Net income margin represents net income as a percentage of revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin represents adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure we use to assess our financial performance and is also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe adjusted EBITDA is helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because it can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP measures and are presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered as alternatives or substitutes to the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of operations that are necessary to run our business. Other companies, including other companies in our industry, may not use these measures or may calculate these measures differently than as presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.

 Free Cash Flow 
 Free cash flow is a key performance measure that our management uses to assess our overall performance. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by our business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening our financial position. 
 We calculate free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and internal-use software development costs. 
 Although we believe free cash flow is a useful indicator of business performance, free cash flow is presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool, and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities. Some of the limitations of free cash flow are that it may not properly reflect future contractual commitments that have not been realized in the current period. Our free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because they may not calculate free cash flow in the same manner as we calculate the measure, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of our free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating activities, for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):

 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 Marketing Solutions. Our customers purchase a subscription to Marketing Solutions, either directly or through marketing agencies, for the ability to share tailored content on the Doximity platform via a variety of modules for defined time periods. We generally bill customers a portion of the contract upon contract execution and then bill throughout the remainder of the contract based on various time-based milestones. Generally, we bill in advance of revenue recognition. When revenue is recognized in advance of billings, we record unbilled revenue. Unbilled revenue is recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets within prepaid expenses and other current assets. Subscriptions to Marketing Solutions include the following contractual arrangements: 
 Subscriptions for specific modules delivered on a monthly basis to a consistent number of targeted Doximity members during the subscription period. Pricing is based on the number and composition of the targeted Doximity members, and on the specific modules purchased. 
 Integrated subscriptions for a fixed subscription fee that are not tied to a single module, allowing customers to utilize any combination of modules during the subscription period. 
 For these subscription-based contractual arrangements, we recognize revenue over time as control of the service is transferred to the customer. 
 Hiring Solutions. We provide customers access to our platform which enables them to post job openings or deliver a fixed number of monthly messages to our network of medical professionals. Hiring Solutions contracts are noncancelable and customers are billed in annual, quarterly, or monthly installments in advance of the service period, and revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual term. 
 We also generate revenue from temporary and permanent medical recruiting services which we charge on an hourly-fee, and retainer and placement-fee basis, respectively. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the revenue from temporary and permanent medical recruiting services was not significant to our total revenue. 
 For a description of our revenue accounting policies, see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 and filed with the SEC on May 23, 2024. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of revenue is primarily comprised of expenses related to cloud hosting, personnel-related expenses for our customer success team, costs for third-party platform access, information technology and software-related services and contractors, and other services used in connection with the delivery and support of our platform. Our cost of revenue also includes the amortization of internal-use software development costs, editorial and other content-related expenses, and allocated overhead. Cost of revenue is driven by the growth of our member network and utilization of our productivity tools. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our cloud infrastructure and our customer support organizations to support the growth of our business. 
 Gross Profit and Gross Margin 
 Gross profit is total revenue less total cost of revenue. Gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue. Gross profit and gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a number of factors, including the timing of our acquisition of new customers and sa les of additional solutions to existing customer s , the timing and extent of our investments in our operations, cloud hosting costs, growth in our customer success team, and the timing of amortization of internal-use software development costs. We expect our gross margin to remain relatively steady over the near term, although our quarterly gross margin is expected to fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of these and other factors. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative expenses, and restructuring and impairment charge.

Table of Contents 

 Research and Development 
 Research and development expense is primarily comprised of personnel-related expenses associated with our engineering and product teams who are responsible for building new products and improving existing products. Research and development expense also includes costs for third-party services and contractors, information technology and software-related costs, and allocated overhead. Other than internal-use software development costs that qualify for capitalization, research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We expect research and development expenses will increase on an absolute dollar basis as we continue to grow our platform and product offerings. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing expense is primarily comprised of personnel-related expenses , sales incentive compensation, advertising costs, travel, and other event expenses. Sales and marketing expense also includes costs for third-party services and contractors, information technology and software-related costs, allocated overhead, amortization of intangible assets, and change in fair value of contingent earn-out consideration liability. We capitalize sales incentive compensation that is considered to be an incremental and recoverable cost of obtaining a contract with a customer. These sales incentive compensation costs are amortized over the period of benefit. We expect sales and marketing expense to increase and to be our largest expense on an absolute basis. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expense is primarily comprised of personnel-related expenses associated with our executive, finance, legal, human resources, information technology, and facilities employees. General and administrative expense includes fees for third-party legal and accounting services, insurance expense, information technology and software-related costs, and allocated overhead. We expect that general and administrative expense will increase on an absolute dollar basis as we incur compliance costs associated with being a publicly-traded company, including legal, audit, and consulting fees. 
 Restructuring and Impairment Charge 
 Restructuring expenses primarily consist of severance payments, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation in relation to the modification of equity awards associated with the management-approved plan. One-time employee termination benefits are recognized at the time of communication of the terms of the plan to the employees, unless future service is required, in which case the costs are recognized over the future service period. Impairment charges primarily include impairment of right-of-use and other property and equipment recognized upon the execution of a sublease for a portion of our office space. 
 Other Income, Net 
 Other income, net consists primarily of investment income earned on our cash equivalents and marketable securities. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 Provision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in U.S. federal, state, and local jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We calculate income taxes in interim periods by applying an estimated annual effective tax rate to income before income taxes and by calculating the tax effect of discrete items recognized during the period. Our effective income tax rate generally differs from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21.0 primarily due to U.S. federal and state research and development tax credits and stock-based compensation related tax benefits, and state income taxes.

 Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 23.2 million as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a 23.0 million increase in subscription revenue. Of the increase in subscription revenue, 5.7 million was driven by the addition of new subscription customers 1 and 17.3 million was due to the expansion of existing customers. The expansion of existing customers was primarily driven by average revenue per existing Marketing Solutions customers increasing by approximately 22 as a result of adding new and growing existing brands and service lines. Approximately 95 of our revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was derived from subscription customers. 
 Revenue for the six months ended September 30, 2024 increased 41.4 million as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a 41.7 million increase in subscription revenue. Of the increase in subscription revenue, 9.0 million was driven by the addition of new subscription customers 1 and 32.7 million was due to the expansion of existing customers. The expansion of existing customers was primarily driven by average revenue per existing Marketing Solutions customers increasing by approximately 20 as a result of adding new and growing existing brands and service lines. Approximately 95 of our revenue for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was derived from subscription customers.

 Cost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 0.9 million as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was driven by a 0.4 million increase in stock-based compensation as a result of new awards granted to existing employees and a 0.3 million increase in third-party software costs to support revenue growth. 
 Cost of revenue for the six months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.3 million as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a 0.8 million increase in stock-based compensation as a result of new awards granted to existing employees and a 0.3 million increase in third-party software costs to support revenue growth. 
 The gross margin for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 increased due to the growth in our revenue outpacing the growth in our cost of revenue. 
 
 1 We define new subscription customers as revenue-generating subscription customers in the current fiscal period who did not contribute any revenue for the same period in the prior fiscal year.

 Research and development expense for the six months ended September 30, 2024 increased 3.9 million as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was driven by a 4.3 million increase in stock-based compensation, primarily due to new awards granted to existing employees, a 0.6 million increase due to employee events and travel-related expenses, partially offset by a 0.9 million decrease in personnel costs due to reduction in average headcount as a result of the Company s restructuring plan executed in August 2023.

 Sales and marketing expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 4.2 million as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was driven by a 4.1 million increase in stock-based compensation primarily due to new awards granted to existing and new employees and the reversal of expense in the prior period from award forfeitures as a result of the August 2023 restructuring plan and a 0.7 million increase in sales incentive compensation. These increases were partially offset by a 0.7 million decrease in personnel costs due to a reduction in average headcount. 
 Sales and marketing expense for the six months ended September 30, 2024 increased 5.0 million as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was driven by a 4.7 million net increase in stock-based compensation as a result of new awards granted to existing and new employees, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation from awards fully vested since the prior year, a 1.7 million increase in sales incentive compensation, and a 0.6 million increase in third-party software and contractor costs. These increases were partially offset by a 2.3 million decrease in personnel costs due to a reduction in average headcount.

 During the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, the Company executed a sublease for its Curative office space in Irving, Texas, which resulted in a 2.3 million impairment charge for the subleased asset group. 
 In August 2023, the Company initiated a restructuring plan to better align the Company s resources with its priorities, and reduced its workforce by 10 . The 7.9 million in restructuring charges incurred during the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of 4.3 million of severance payments and employee benefits and 3.6 million of stock-based compensation expense for the accelerated vesting of equity awards.

 Other income, net for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 increased 3.1 million and 5.4 million as compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily driven by increases in interest income due to higher yields earned on our cash equivalents and marketable securities portfolio, partially offset by lower average portfolio balances.

 Income tax expense for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 increased 8.9 million and 14.6 million as compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily driven by higher income before taxes and decreased tax deductions from stock award activities. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Since inception, we have financed operations primarily through proceeds received from sales of equity securities and payments received from our customers. As of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of 805.6 million. Our marketable securities consist of U.S. government and agency securities, corporate notes and bonds, and commercial paper. 
 Prior to March 31, 2024, the Company s board of directors authorized various programs to repurchase up to 410 million of the Company s Class A common stock. Under these programs, the Company repurchased and retired 16,480,514 shares of Class A common stock. All of these programs were completed as of April 2024. 
 On May 1, 2024 the Company s board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 500 million of the Company s Class A common stock with no expiration date. As of September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased and retired 1,021,233 shares of Class A common stock under this program for an aggregate purchase price of 30.0 million and 470.0 million remained available and authorized for repurchase. 
 All repurchases are subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities and may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans.

Table of Contents 

 Immediately upon the repurchase of any shares of Class A common stock, such shares shall be retired by the Company and shall automatically return to the status of authorized but unissued shares of Class A common stock. 
 Effective January 1, 2023, the Company s share repurchases in excess of allowable share issuances are subject to a 1 excise tax as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. As of March 31, 2024 and September 30, 2024, the Company had accrued excise taxes of 1.5 million, all of which remained unpaid as of September 30, 2024. 
 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to support working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue growth rate, the timing and the amount of cash received from customers, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, timing of share repurchases, and the timing and extent of spending to support research and development efforts. Further, we may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in businesses and technologies. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements and do not have any holdings in variable interest entities. 
 For further details regarding our cash requirements from noncancelable operating lease obligations and other contractual commitments, see Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies and Note 13 Leases included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Cash Flows 
 Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities 109,589 70,098 Net cash provided by investing activities 54,099 67,224 Net cash used in financing activities (76,225) (186,946) 
 Net cash provided by operating activities 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 109.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024. This consisted of net income of 85.5 million, adjusted for non-cash items of 42.9 million and a net outflow from operating assets and liabilities of 18.8 million. Non-cash items primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expense of 35.0 million, depreciation and amortization expense of 5.2 million, amortization of deferred contract costs of 4.8 million, impairment of long-lived assets of 2.3 million, and non-cash lease expense of 1.0 million, partially offset by the accretion of discount on marketable securities of 5.4 million. The net outflow from operating assets and liabilities was driven by a 23.5 million increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of billings and collections, a 5.5 million decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities which was primarily due to the timing of income tax and transferable tax credit payments, a 5.5 million decrease in deferred revenue due to the timing of customer billings and program launches, and a 3.2 million increase in deferred contract costs. The outflows were partially offset by a 19.9 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets primarily due to prepaid taxes. During the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company made 22.0 million and 29.4 million, respectively, in payments for taxes. The increase in cash paid for income taxes in these periods, as compared to prior years, was partially related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures and required taxpayers to capitalize and amortize them over five or fifteen years. Although Congress is considering legislation that would defer the amortization requirement to later years, we have no assurance that the provision will be so deferred, repealed or otherwise modified. The requirement may also reduce our cash flows from operating activities in future periods, the amounts and specific periods of which we are unable to estimate at this time. 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 70.1 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. This consisted of net income of 59.0 million, adjusted for non-cash items of 36.8 million and a net outflow from operating assets and liabilities of 25.7 million. Non-cash items primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expense of 27.4 million, depreciation and amortization expense of 5.2 million, amortization of deferred contract costs of 4.7 million, non-cash lease expense of 1.1 million, partially offset by the accretion of discount on marketable securities of 1.8 million. The net outflow from operating assets and liabilities was driven by a 13.8 million decrease in deferred revenue due to the timing of customer billings and program launches, a 10.5 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets primarily due to prepayment of income

 taxes, an 8.1 million decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities which was primarily due to the timing of commissions and agency rebate payments, and a 2.4 million increase in deferred contract costs. These outflows were partially offset by a 9.6 million decrease in accounts receivable due to the timing of billings and collections. 
 Net cash provided by investing activities 
 Cash provided by investing activities was 54.1 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, which primarily consisted of proceeds from the maturities of marketable securities of 417.9 million and 7.2 million of proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, partially offset by 367.8 million of marketable securities purchases and 3.2 million for internal-use software development costs. 
 Cash provided by investing activities was 67.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023, which primarily consisted of proceeds from the maturities of marketable securities of 212.8 million and proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of 37.5 million. These inflows were partially offset by 180.2 million of marketable securities purchases and 2.7 million for internal-use software development costs. 
 Net cash used in financing activities 
 Cash used in financing activities was 76.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, which primarily consisted of common stock repurchases of 74.2 million, 5.5 million of payments for contingent consideration related to the AMiON acquisition, and 8.2 million of taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards. These payments were partially offset by 10.2 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and common stock warrants, and 1.4 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the Company s employee stock purchase plan. 
 Cash used in financing activities was 186.9 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023, which primarily consisted of common stock repurchases of 186.2 million, 5.4 million of payments for contingent consideration related to the AMiON acquisition, and 4.1 million of taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards. These payments were partially offset by 7.2 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, and 1.5 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to the employee stock purchase plan. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts stated in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by management. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows will be affected. 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to those described in the section titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 and filed with the SEC on May 23, 2024. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 Refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Substantially all of our operations are within the United States and we do not have any foreign currency exposure. We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, including the effects of interest rate changes and inflation. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities primarily consist of cash on hand and highly liquid investments in money market funds, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, and U.S. government and agency securities. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 184.2 million and marketable securities of 621.3 million. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our investments are exposed to market risk due to fluctuations in 
 
 34 

Table of Contents 

 interest rates, which may affect our interest income and the fair value of our investments. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. 
 A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of 5.0 million and 3.4 million, respectively, in the market value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investments caused by a change in interest rates are recorded in other comprehensive income and are realized in net income only if we sell the underlying securities. 
 Impact of Inflation 
 We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Nonetheless, if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Beginning in April 2024, the Company and certain of our directors and officers have been named in lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The first lawsuit is captioned In re Doximity, Inc. Securities Litigation, No. 5:24-cv-02281-EKL (N.D. Cal.). The operative complaint brings securities law claims on behalf of a putative class of our investors from June 24, 2021 and August 8, 2023 against the Company and our CEO related to our disclosure of user count and engagement rates. Two shareholder derivative lawsuits have also been filed and are consolidated under the caption In re Doximity, Inc. Derivative Litigation, No. 5:24-cv-02801-EKL (N.D. Cal.). The complaints assert claims for, among other things, breach of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, and waste against certain of our directors and officers on a similar basis to the securities lawsuit. Other similar lawsuits or proceedings may be initiated in the future. The defendants intend to defend vigorously against these actions. 
 For further discussion of our legal proceedings, please refer to Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 We are subject to various risks that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, they may include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed under Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. There have been no material changes to the risk factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
 Common Stock Warrant Exercises 
 On August 8, 2024 and August 14, 2024, the Company issued 100,000 and 100,667 shares of Class A common stock, respectively, upon the exercise of the warrant issued to U.S. News World Report, L.P. in June 2021, at an exercise price of 12.56 per share and aggregate consideration of 1.3 million and 1.3 million, respectively. 
 The foregoing transaction did not involve any underwriters, underwriting discounts, or commissions, or any public offering. We believe the issuance of the above securities was exempt from registration by virtue of Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act because the issuance of the securities to the recipients was a transaction that did not involve a public offering. The recipient of the securities in the transaction represented (i) its intentions to acquire the securities for investment only and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof, and (ii) that it is an accredited investor under Regulation D of the Securities Act. Appropriate legends were placed upon the stock certificates issued in the transaction. The recipient had adequate access, through its relationships with us, to information about us. The issuance of these securities was made without any general solicitation or advertising.
