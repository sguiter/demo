Forward-Looking
Statements 

This
annual report contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are projections of events, revenues, income, future economic
performance or management s plans and objectives for future operations. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified
by the use of terminology such as may , should , expect , plan , anticipate ,
 believe , estimate , predict , potential or continues or the negative
of these terms or other comparable terminology. Examples of forward-looking statements made in this annual report include or may include,
among others, statements about: 

our
 proposed plan of operations; 

our
 financial and operating objectives and strategies to achieve them; 

the
 costs and timing of our services; 

our
 use of available funds; 

our
 capital and funding requirements; and 

our
 other financial or operating performances. 

The
material assumptions supporting these forward-looking statements include, among other things: 

our
 future growth potential, results of operations, prospects and opportunities; 

execution
 of our business strategy; 

there
 being no material variations in current regulatory environments; 

our
 operating expenses, including general and administrative expenses; 

our
 ability to obtain any necessary financing on acceptable terms; 

timing
 and amount of capital expenditures; 

retention
 of skilled personnel; 

continuation
 of current tax and regulatory regimes; and 

general
 economic and financial market conditions. 

Although
management considers these assumptions reasonable based on information currently available to it, they may prove incorrect. 

These
forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including: 

inability
 to efficiently manage our operations; 

general
 economic and business conditions; 

our
 negative operating cash flow; 

our
 ability to obtain additional financing; 

our
 ability to collect outstanding loans; 

increases
 in capital and operating costs; 

general
 cryptocurrency risks; 

technological
 changes and developments in the blockchain and cryptocurrencies; 

risks
 relating to regulatory changes or actions; 

competition
 for blockchain platforms and technologies; and 

other
 factors discussed under the section entitled Risk Factors , 

any
of which may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results,
levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Further, although we have attempted
to identify factors that could cause actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from those
described in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause results, levels of activity, performance or achievements
not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. 

3 

While
these forward-looking statements and any assumptions upon which they are based are made in good faith and reflect management s
current judgment regarding the direction of our business, actual results may vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions,
projections, assumptions or other future performance suggested herein. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking
statements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States and Canada, we do not intend to
update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results. All forward-looking statements in this annual
report are qualified by this cautionary statement. 

Unless otherwise stated, all
financial information contained herein is shown in United States dollars. Our financial statements are prepared
by the United States generally accepted accounting principles. Unless otherwise stated, refers to United
States dollars. 

In
this annual report, unless otherwise specified, all references to shares refer to shares of common stock in the capital
of our company.

Description
of Business 

Overview 

Our business owns, builds, partners with and operates Web3 Platforms-as-a-Service
that leverages Web3 tools and technologies like Blockchain, digital wallets rewards and non-fungible and fungible tokens and green
technologies. We anticipate that we will enable companies to leverage these emerging technologies to grow and complement their existing
and new businesses in ways they could not using traditional or web2 centralized technologies. 

Web3 

Is generally referred to
as the next iteration of the World Wide Web. Web3 incorporates the concepts of decentralization, digital ownership, blockchain-based
technologies and the use and tokenization of both physical and digital assets. 

Blockchain
Technology 

Blockchain
is a continuously growing list of records called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block contains typically
a hash pointer as a link to a previous block, a timestamp and transaction data. By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification
of the data. Functionally, a blockchain can serve as an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently
and in a verifiable and permanent way. For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively
adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without
the alteration of all subsequent blocks and a collusion of the network majority. Blockchains are secure by design and are an example
of a distributed computing system and decentralization can be achieved with a blockchain. This makes blockchains potentially suitable
for the recording of events, medical records and other record management activities, such as identity management, documenting provenance,
digital asset registration and transaction processing.

We
do not intend to find or make referrals to, or otherwise solicit, or assist in any way in the solicitation of, investors for investment

any activity that would require us to register under Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or similar provisions under
state law. 

Sales

We
intend to implement our sales and marketing plan to attract new clients to our fintech-as-a-service and consulting business as follows: 

Direct
 sales pipeline development and management with management signing and managing qualified business prospects;

Speaking

Public
 relations campaigns. 

Competition 

We
are in a novel business of providing services for companies to develop and integrate blockchain and Web3 technologies into
their business operations. We compete with the many companies in the Web3 space. Here are some of the larger competitors: 

ConsenSys 

ConsenSys
is a venture production studio building decentralized applications and various developer and end-user tools for blockchain ecosystems,
primarily focused on Ethereum. The ConsenSys hub coordinates, incubates, accelerates and spawns spoke ventures
through development, resource sharing, acquisitions, investments and the formation of joint ventures. These spokes benefit from foundational
components built by ConsenSys that enable new services and business models to be built on the blockchain. In addition to the development
of internal projects and consulting work, ConsenSys is engaged in the identification, development and acquisition of talent and projects
on an ongoing basis. 

6 

IBM 

With
thousands of technical experts, IBM is moving quickly into enterprise blockchain and claims the leading blockchain for business platform.
This is primarily B2B-focused work. 

Many
of our current and potential competitors may have greater brand recognition, longer operating histories, larger customer bases and,
significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend
greater amounts on product development, marketing and distribution. This advantage could enable our competitors to acquire a larger
market share and develop and offer more competitive products and services. Such competition could adversely impact our ability to
attain the financing necessary for us to develop our business plan. In the face of competition, we may not be successful in
sufficient market share to make our business profitable. 

Many
 of the large management consultancy firms are developing blockchain-specific practice areas including Accenture, Deloitte and Bain. 

Intellectual
Property and Technology 

We
do not currently own any intellectual property. We intend to aggressively assert our rights under trade secrets, patents, trademarks and
copyright laws to protect any intellectual property that we create, including product design, product research and concepts and recognized
trademarks. These rights may be protected through the acquisition of patents and trademark registrations, the maintenance of trade secrets,
the development of trade dress, and, where appropriate, litigation against those who are, in our opinion, infringing these rights. 

We
may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of
our proprietary rights. In addition, while we are not aware that our services or proprietary rights infringe the proprietary rights
of third parties, we may receive notices from third parties asserting that we have infringed their patents, trademarks, copyrights
or other intellectual property rights. Any such claims could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause service stoppages
or lead us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements rather than disputing the merits of such claims. An adverse outcome in
litigation or similar proceedings could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require the expenditure of
significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, require disputed rights to be licensed from others or require us to
cease operating our business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial
condition. 

As
we are still in the early stages of developing our business, we have devoted no substantial efforts to research and development within
the last three fiscal years. 

Government
Regulation 

Current
and future legislation rulemaking and other regulatory developments, including interpretations released by a regulatory authority,
may impact how bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies are viewed or treated for classification and clearing purposes. In particular,
bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies may not be excluded from the definition of security by regulatory rulemaking or interpretation
requiring registration of all transactions, unless an exemption is available, including transacting in bitcoin or cryptocurrency amongst
owners and requiring registration of trading platforms as exchanges such as Coinsquare. We cannot be certain as to how future
regulatory developments will impact the treatment of bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies under the law. If we determine not to comply
with such additional regulatory and registration requirements, we may seek to cease certain of our operations or be subjected to fines,
penalties and other governmental action. Any such action may adversely affect an investment in us. Such circumstances would have a material
adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue this segment at all, which would have a material adverse effect
on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any cryptocurrencies we hold or expect to acquire for our account
and harm investors. 

We
intend to comply with any applicable anti-money laundering or know-your-customer rules relating to tokens imposed by the SEC and Canadian
securities regulators. 

Investment
Company Act of 1940 Considerations 

We
intend to conduct our operations so that we do not fall within, or are excluded from the definition of an investment company 
under the Investment Company Act of 1940. 

7 

Under
Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, a company is deemed to be an investment company if it is, or
holds itself out as being, engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in
securities. We believe that we will not be considered an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act of
1940 because we will not engage primarily or hold ourselves out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting
or trading in securities. Rather, our new business is a services and development business that provides a turnkey set of services for
companies to develop and integrate blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies into their business operations. 

Under
Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, a company is deemed to be an investment company if it is engaged,
or proposes to engage, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire
 investment securities having a value exceeding 40 of the value of our company s total assets (exclusive of U.S.
Government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis, which we refer to as the 40 test. We intend to monitor
our holdings and conduct operations so that on an unconsolidated basis we will comply with the 40 test. Nevertheless, because we may
accept tokens, coins or equity in payment for our services, to the extent permitted under applicable law, we may acquire investment
securities having a value exceeding 40 of the value of our company s total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities
and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. In that case, we intend to rely on a safe harbour exemption from the Investment Company Act
of 1940 for so-called transient investment companies. 

Consistent
with the transient investment company safe harbour, we will have to reduce our holdings of investment securities
to not more than 40 of our total assets as soon as is reasonably possible and in any event within one year from the earlier of (i) the
date on which we own securities and/or cash having a value exceeding 50 of the value of our company s total assets on either a
consolidated or unconsolidated basis or (ii) the date on which we own or propose to acquire investment securities having
a value exceeding 40 of the value of our company s total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an
unconsolidated basis. This reduction could be attempted in several ways, including the disposition of securities and the acquisition
of other assets that would not constitute investment securities for purposes of the Investment Company Act of 1940. If we are required
to sell securities, we may sell them sooner than we otherwise would, the sales may be at depressed prices, and we may never realize anticipated
benefits from, or may incur losses on, those investments. We may not be able to sell some investments due to contractual or legal restrictions
or the inability to locate a suitable buyer. We may also incur tax liabilities when we sell our assets. If we decide to try to acquire
additional assets that would not constitute investment securities, we may not be able to identify and acquire suitable assets. If these
steps do not achieve a sufficient reduction in our holdings of investment securities within the prescribed period, we will be forced
to liquidate some of our securities holdings and invest the proceeds in U.S. government securities and cash items, with a potential loss. 

Because
we can rely on the transient investment company safe harbour only once during any three years, we may not accept
tokens, coins or equity in payment for our services during the period that this safe harbour is not available. 

If
we become obligated to register our company as an investment company, we would have to comply with a variety of substantive requirements
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 imposing, among other things: 

limitations
 on capital structure; 

restrictions
 on specified investments; 

prohibitions
 on transactions with affiliates; and 

compliance
 with reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy disclosure and other rules and regulations that would significantly change our operations. 

If
we were required to register our company as an investment company but failed to do so, we would be prohibited from engaging in our business,
and criminal and civil actions could be brought against us. In addition, our contracts would be unenforceable unless a court required
enforcement and a court could appoint a receiver to take control of us and liquidate our business, all of which would have a material
adverse effect on us. 

Employees 

As
of April 10, 2024, we have two executive officers, Scott Gallagher, who is our president, and Swapan Kakumanu, who is our chief
financial officer, secretary, and treasurer and no employees. Our management oversees all responsibilities in the areas of corporate
administration, business development, and research. We also employ consultants on an as-needed basis to provide specific expertise
in areas of product design and development and other business functions including marketing and accounting. We intend to expand our
current management to retain skilled directors, officers, and employees with experience relevant to our business focus.

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

An
investment in our common stock involves several very significant risks. You should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties
in addition to other information in this annual report in evaluating our company and our business before purchasing our securities. Our
business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed as a result of the occurrence of any of the following risks.
You could lose all or part of your investment due to any of these risks. You should invest in our common stock only if you can afford
to lose your entire investment. 

General
Cryptocurrency Risks 

Cryptocurrency
exchanges and other trading venues are relatively new and, in most cases, largely unregulated and may therefore be subject to fraud and
failures. 

When
cryptocurrency exchanges or other trading venues are involved in fraud or experience security failures or other operational issues, such
events could result in a reduction in cryptocurrency prices or confidence impact our success and have a material adverse effect on
our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue this segment at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business,
prospects and operations. 

Cryptocurrency
market prices depend, directly or indirectly, on the prices set on exchanges and other trading venues, which are new and, in most cases,
largely unregulated as compared to established, regulated exchanges for securities, commodities or currencies. For example, during the
past three years, several Bitcoin exchanges have closed due to fraud, business failure or security breaches. In many of these instances,
the customers of the closed exchanges were not compensated or made whole for partial or complete losses of their account balances. While
smaller exchanges are less likely to have the infrastructure and capitalization that may provide larger exchanges with some stability,
larger exchanges may be more likely to be appealing targets for hackers and malware (i.e., software used or programmed
by attackers to disrupt computer operation, gather sensitive information or gain access to private computer systems) and may be more
likely to be targets of regulatory enforcement action. We do not maintain any insurance to protect from such risks and do not expect
any insurance for customer accounts to be available (such as federal deposit insurance) at any time in the future, putting customer accounts
at risk from such events. In the event we face fraud, security failures, operational issues or similar events such factors would have
a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue this segment at all, which would have a material
adverse effect on our business, prospects and operations. 

Regulatory
changes or actions may alter the nature of an investment in us or restrict the use of cryptocurrencies in a manner that adversely affects
our business, prospects or operations. 

As
cryptocurrencies have grown in both popularity and market size, governments around the world have reacted differently to cryptocurrencies,
with certain governments deeming them illegal while others have allowed their use and trade. 

Governments
may in the future regulate, curtail or outlaw the ability for acquisition, use or redemption of cryptocurrencies. Ownership of, holding
or trading in cryptocurrencies may then be considered illegal and subject to sanction. Governments may also take regulatory action that
may increase the cost and/or subject cryptocurrency companies to additional regulation. Similar actions by governments or regulatory
bodies could result in restriction of the acquisition, ownership, holding, selling, use or trading of our securities. The effect of any
future regulatory change on our business or any cryptocurrency that may impact our business is impossible to predict, but such change
could be substantial and would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects and operations. 

On-going
and future regulatory actions and regulatory change related to our business or cryptocurrencies may impact our ability to continue to
operate and such actions could affect our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue this segment at all, which would have a
material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations.

The
development and acceptance of cryptographic and algorithmic protocols governing the issuance of transactions in cryptocurrencies
are subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate. 

The
use of cryptocurrencies to, among other things, buy and sell goods and services and complete transactions, is part of a new and rapidly
evolving industry that employs digital assets based upon a computer-generated mathematical and/or cryptographic protocol. The growth
of this industry in general, and the use of cryptocurrencies in particular, is subject to a high degree of uncertainty, and the slowing
or stopping of the development or acceptance of developing protocols may occur and is unpredictable. The factors include, but are not
limited to: 

Continued
 worldwide growth in the adoption and use of cryptocurrencies; 

Governmental
 and quasi-governmental regulation of cryptocurrencies and their use, or restrictions on or regulation of access to and operation
 of the network or similar cryptocurrency systems; 

Changes
 in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences; 

The
 maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of the network; 

The
 availability and popularity of other forms or methods of buying and selling goods and services, including new means of using fiat
 currencies; 

Maintenance
 and development of cryptosystems requires a large draw of power and secure battery backup systems, development of these related
 products has significant environmental impacts that could negatively impact public popularity; 

General
 economic conditions and the regulatory environment relating to digital assets; and 

Negative
 consumer sentiment and perception of Bitcoin specifically and cryptocurrencies generally. 

Such
events would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue this segment at all, which would
have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any cryptocurrencies we hold or
expect to acquire for our account and harm investors in our securities. 

Banks
and financial institutions may not provide banking services or may cut off services, to businesses that provide cryptocurrency-related
services or that accept cryptocurrencies as payment, including financial institutions of investors in our securities. 

Several companies that provide Bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrency-related services have been unable to find banks or financial institutions
that are willing to provide them with bank accounts and other services. Similarly, several companies and individuals or businesses
associated with cryptocurrencies may have had and may continue to have their existing bank accounts closed or services discontinued with
financial institutions. We also may be unable to obtain or maintain these services for our business. The difficulty that many businesses
that provide bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrency-related services have and may continue to have in finding banks and financial institutions
willing to provide them services may be decreasing the usefulness of cryptocurrencies as a payment system and harming public perception
of cryptocurrencies and could decrease its usefulness and harm its public perception in the future. Similarly, the usefulness of cryptocurrencies
as a payment system and the public perception of cryptocurrencies could be damaged if banks or financial institutions were to close the
accounts of businesses providing bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrency-related services. This could occur as a result of compliance risk,
cost, government regulation or public pressure. The risk applies to securities firms, clearance and settlement firms, national stock
and commodities exchanges, the over-the-counter market and the Depository Trust Company, which, if any of such entities adopts or implements
similar policies, rules or regulations, could result in the inability of our investors to open or maintain stock or commodities accounts,
including the ability to deposit, maintain or trade our securities. Such factors would have a material adverse effect on our ability
to continue as a going concern or to pursue this segment at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects
or operations and harm investors. 

The
impact of geopolitical events on the supply and demand for cryptocurrencies is uncertain. 

Crises
may motivate large-scale purchases of cryptocurrencies which could increase the price of cryptocurrencies rapidly. This may increase
the likelihood of a subsequent price decrease as crisis-driven purchasing behaviour wanes, adversely affecting the value of any cryptocurrencies
we hold or expect to acquire for our account. Such risks are similar to the risks of purchasing commodities in general uncertain
times, such as the risk of purchasing, holding or selling gold. 

10 

As
an alternative to gold or fiat currencies that are backed by central governments, cryptocurrencies, which are relatively new, are subject
to supply and demand forces. How such supply and demand will be impacted by geopolitical events is uncertain but could be harmful to
us and investors in our securities. Nevertheless, political or economic crises may motivate large-scale acquisitions or sales of cryptocurrencies
either globally or locally. Such events would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue
this segment at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of
any cryptocurrencies we hold or expect to acquire for our account. 

Acceptance
and/or widespread use of cryptocurrency is uncertain. 

Currently,
there is a relatively small use of bitcoins and/or other cryptocurrencies in the retail and commercial marketplace for goods or services.
In comparison, there is relatively large use by speculators contributing to price volatility. 

The
relative lack of acceptance of cryptocurrencies in the retail and commercial marketplace limits the ability of end-users to use them
to pay for goods and services. Such lack of acceptance or decline in acceptances would have a material adverse effect on our ability
to continue as a going concern or to pursue this segment at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects
or operations and potentially the value of any cryptocurrencies we hold or expect to acquire for our account. 

Political
or economic crises may motivate large-scale sales of Bitcoins Ethereum, or other cryptocurrencies, which could result in a reduction
in value and adversely affect us. 

There
was much volatility in the digital assets industry during 2022 and 2021. During 2022 there was the collapse of FTX, a major exchange,
which led the crypto market cap to decline by billions of U.S. dollars in only a few days. Large-scale sales of bitcoins and Ethereum
or other cryptocurrencies would result in a reduction in their value and could adversely affect us. Such circumstances would have a material
adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue this segment at all, which would have a material adverse effect
on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any cryptocurrencies we hold or expect to acquire for our account
and harm investors. 

It
may be illegal now, or in the future, to acquire, own, hold, sell or use Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other cryptocurrencies, participate in
the blockchain or utilize similar digital assets in one or more countries, the ruling of which would adversely affect us. 

Although
currently bitcoins, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies, blockchain and digital assets generally are not regulated or are lightly regulated
in most countries, including the United States, one or more countries such as China and Russia may take regulatory actions in the future
that could severely restrict the right to acquire, own, hold, sell or use these digital assets or to exchange these digital assets for
fiat currency. Such restrictions may adversely affect us. Such circumstances would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue
as a going concern or to pursue this segment at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations
and potentially the value of any cryptocurrencies we hold or expect to acquire for our account and harm investors. 

If
regulatory changes or interpretations require the regulation of digital assets under the securities laws of the United States or elsewhere,
including the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Company Act of 1940 or similar laws of other
jurisdictions and interpretations by the SEC, CFTC, IRS, Department of Treasury or other agencies or authorities, we may be required
to register and comply with such regulations, including at a state or local level. To the extent that we decide to continue operations,
the required registrations and regulatory compliance steps may result in extraordinary expense or burdens to us. We may also decide to
cease certain operations. Any disruption of our operations in response to the changed regulatory circumstances may be at a time that
is disadvantageous to us. 

Current
and future legislation SEC rulemaking and other regulatory developments, including interpretations released by a regulatory authority,
may impact how digital assets are viewed or treated for classification and clearing purposes. In particular, digital
assets may not be excluded from the definition of security by SEC rulemaking or interpretation requiring registration of
all transactions, unless another exemption is available, including transacting in digital assets amongst owners and requiring registration
of trading platforms as exchanges . We cannot be certain as to how future regulatory developments will impact the treatment
of digital assets s under the law. If we determine not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements, we may
seek to cease certain of our operations or be subjected to fines, penalties and other governmental action. Any such action may adversely
affect an investment in us. Such circumstances would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or
to pursue this segment at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the
value of any digital assets we hold or expect to acquire for our account and harm investors. 

11 

Lack
of liquid markets and possible manipulation of blockchain/cryptocurrency-based assets may adversely affect us. 

Digital
assets that are represented and traded on a ledger-based platform may not necessarily benefit from viable trading markets. Stock exchanges
have listing requirements and vet issuers, requiring them to be subjected to rigorous listing standards and rules and monitoring investors
transacting on such platforms for fraud and other improprieties. These conditions may not necessarily be replicated on a distributed ledger
platform, depending on the platform s controls and other policies. The more lax a distributed ledger platform is about vetting
issuers of digital assets or users that transact on the platform, the higher the potential risk for fraud or the manipulation of digital
assets. These factors may decrease liquidity or volume, or increase volatility of digital securities or other assets trading on a ledger-based
system, which may adversely affect us. Such circumstances would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going
concern or to pursue this segment at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially
the value of any cryptocurrencies we hold or expect to acquire for our account and harm investors. 

Risks
Related to Our Business 

We
have an evolving business model. 

As
fintech and blockchain technologies become more widely available, we expect the services and products associated with them to evolve.
As a result, to stay current with the industry, our business model may need to evolve as well. From time to time, we may modify aspects
of our business model relating to our product mix and service offerings. We cannot offer any assurance that these or any other modifications
will be successful or will not result in harm to the business. We may not be able to manage growth effectively, which could damage our
reputation, limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results. Such circumstances would have a material adverse effect on
our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue this segment at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business,
prospects or operations and potentially the value of any cryptocurrencies we hold or expect to acquire for our account and harm investors. 

The
loss or potential loss of our exclusion from regulation pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisors Act of
1940 or any related state exemptions, could require us to restructure our operations. 

The
SEC heavily regulates how investment companies, investment advisors, and broker-dealers 
are permitted to conduct their business activities. We believe we will conduct our business in a manner that does not result in us
being characterized as an investment company, an investment advisor or a broker-dealer, as we do not believe that we will engage in
any of the activities that require registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 or any
similar provisions under state law. We intend to continue to conduct our business in such a manner. If, however, we are deemed to be
an investment company, an investment advisor, or a broker-dealer, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements
and our activities may be restricted, which would affect our business to a material degree. The loss or potential loss of our
exclusion from regulation pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 or any related state
exemptions, could require us to restructure our operations, which could hurt our financial condition and
results of operations. In addition, we are determined to have engaged in activities that require any such registration, without
obtaining such registration, we could be subject to civil and/or criminal liability, which could hurt our
financial condition and results of operations. 

12 

Cryptocurrency
inventory, including that maintained by or for us, may be exposed to cybersecurity threats and hacks. 

As
with any computer code generally, flaws in cryptocurrency codes may be exposed by malicious actors. Several errors and defects have been
found previously, including those that disabled some functionality for users and exposed users information. Flaws in and exploitations
of the source code allow malicious actors to take or create money that has previously occurred. To date, several hackings have become public
knowledge whereby hackers have exploited security vulnerabilities in computer code used by cryptocurrency exchanges, digital wallets
and companies that hold cryptocurrency to steal the equivalent of hundreds of millions of dollars based on current exchange rates. Such
events would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue this segment at all, which would
have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any cryptocurrencies we hold or
expect to acquire for our account. 

Competing
fintech and blockchain platforms and technologies may adversely affect our business. 

The
development and acceptance of competing blockchain platforms or technologies may cause consumers to use alternative distributed ledgers
or an alternative to distributed ledgers altogether. This may adversely affect us and our exposure to various blockchain technologies.
Such circumstances would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue this segment at all,
which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any cryptocurrencies
we hold or expect to acquire for our account and harm investors. 

Competition
in our market could harm our business. 

Many
of our current and potential competitors may have greater brand recognition, longer operating histories, larger customer bases and
significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend
greater amounts on product development, marketing and distribution. This advantage could enable our competitors to acquire a larger
market share and develop and offer more competitive products and services. Such competition could adversely impact our ability to
attain the financing necessary for us to develop our business plan. In the face of competition, we may not be successful in
sufficient market share to make our business profitable. 

The
cryptocurrency assets we may hold may be subject to lose, theft or restriction on access. 

There
is a risk that some or all of the cryptocurrency assets we hold from time to time could be lost or stolen. Access to the cryptocurrency
assets we hold from time to time could also be restricted by cybercrime (such as a denial of service attack) against a service at which
we maintain a hosted online wallet. Any of these events may adversely affect our operations and, consequently, our investments and profitability.
The loss or destruction of a private key required to access our digital wallets may be irreversible and we may be denied access for all
time to our cryptocurrency holdings. Our loss of access to our private keys or our experience of data loss relating to our digital
wallets could adversely affect our investments and assets. 

Cryptocurrencies
are controllable only by the possessor of both the unique public and private keys relating to the local or online digital wallet in
which they are held, and which wallet s public key or address is reflected in the network s public blockchain. We will
publish the public key relating to digital wallets in use when we verify the receipt of transfers and disseminate such information
into the network, but we will need to safeguard the private keys relating to such digital wallets. To the extent such private keys
are lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised, we will be unable to access the cryptocurrency assets we hold from time to time and
such private keys will not be capable of being restored by any network. Any loss of private keys relating to digital wallets used to
store the cryptocurrency assets we hold from time to time would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going
concern or to pursue this segment at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and
potentially the value of any cryptocurrencies we hold or expect to acquire for our account. 

Incorrect
or fraudulent coin transactions may be irreversible. 

Cryptocurrency
transactions are irrevocable, stolen or incorrectly transferred coins may be irretrievable. As a result, any incorrectly executed
or fraudulent coin transactions could adversely affect our investments and assets. 

Coin
transactions are not, from an administrative perspective, reversible without the consent and active participation of the recipient of
the transaction. In theory, cryptocurrency transactions may be reversible with the control or consent of a majority of processing power
on the network. Once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to the blockchain, an incorrect transfer of
a coin or a theft of coin generally will not be reversible and we may not be capable of seeking compensation for any such transfer or
theft. It is possible that, through computer or human error, or theft or criminal action, our coins could be transferred in incorrect
amounts or to unauthorized third parties, or uncontrolled accounts. Such events would have a material adverse effect on our ability
to continue as a going concern or to pursue this segment at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects
or operations and potentially the value of any cryptocurrencies we hold or expect to acquire for our account. 

13 

There
is limited precedence and a lack of authoritative guidance on digital assets. 

Since
there has been limited precedence set for the financial accounting of digital assets, it is unclear how we will be required to account
for digital asset transactions or assets. Furthermore, a change in regulatory or financial accounting standards could result in the necessity
to restate our financial statements. Such a restatement could negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results
of operation. Such circumstances would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue this
segment at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any
cryptocurrencies we hold or expect to acquire for our account and harm investors. 

The
current state of capital markets, particularly for small companies, is expected to reduce our ability to obtain the financing necessary
to continue our business. If we cannot raise the funds that we need to operate and expand our new business, we may go out of business
and investors may lose their entire investment in us. 

Like
other smaller companies, we face difficulties in raising capital for our continued operations and to operate and expand our new business.
We may not be able to raise money through the sale of our equity securities or through borrowing funds on terms we find acceptable. 

We
have had negative cash flows from operations and if we are not able to obtain further financing, our business operations may fail. 

We
had cash and cash equivalents in the amount of 3,076 and a working capital deficit of 2,452,883 as of December 31, 2023, and cash
and cash equivalents of 34,941 and a working deficit of 562,541 as of December 31, 2022. We anticipate that we will require
additional financing while we operate our business. Further, we anticipate that we will not have sufficient capital to fund our
ongoing operations for the next twelve months. We would likely secure any additional financing necessary through a private placement
of our common stock or through debt financing. There can be no assurance that any financing will be available to us, or, even if it
is, if it will be offered on terms and conditions acceptable to us. Our inability to obtain additional financing in a sufficient
amount when needed and upon terms and conditions acceptable to us could have a material adverse effect on us. If additional funds
are raised by issuing equity securities, dilution to existing or future stockholders will result. If adequate funds are not
available on acceptable terms when needed, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate the expansion of our new
business. 

Our
chief financial officer devotes approximately 50 of his working time to our company. 

Swapan
Kakumanu, our chief financial officer, devotes approximately 50 of his working time, or approximately up to 20 hours per week, to our
company. Because Mr. Kakumanu works only part-time, instances may occur where he may not be immediately available to provide solutions
to problems or address concerns that arise in the course of our conducting our business and thus adversely affect our business. In addition,
Mr. Kakumanu can become subject to conflicts of interest because he devotes part of his working time to other business endeavours, including
consulting relationships with other entities, and has responsibilities to these other entities. Such conflicts include deciding how
much time to devote to our affairs, as well as what business opportunities should be presented to us. Because of these relationships,
Mr. Kakumanu could be subject to conflicts of interest. 

14 

The
directors and officers of our company, including Mr. Kakumanu, are aware of the existence of laws governing the accountability of directors
and officers for corporate opportunity and requiring disclosures by the directors and officers of conflicts of interest, and we will
rely upon such laws in respect of any directors and officers conflicts of interest or respect of any breaches of duty
by any of our directors and officers. All such conflicts are to be disclosed by such directors or officers by applicable
laws and the directors and officers are to govern themselves in respect thereof to the best of their ability by the obligations
imposed upon them by law. 

Risks
Related to Our Common Stock 

Because
we can issue additional shares of common stock, our stockholders may experience dilution in the future. 

We
are authorized to issue up to 400,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 117,452,923 shares of common stock were issued and
outstanding as of April 10, 2024. Our board of directors has the authority to cause us to issue additional shares of common stock
without the consent of our stockholders. Consequently, stockholders may experience dilution in their ownership of our stock in the
future. 

If
the outstanding stock options or convertible notes are exercised or converted, then we will be required to issue additional shares of
our common stock, which will result in the dilution of our stockholders ownership of our stock. 

Because
we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock shortly, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return
on their shares unless they sell them. 

We
do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock shortly. The declaration, payment and amount of any future
dividends will be made at the discretion of the board of directors, and will depend upon, among other things, our results of operations,
cash flows and financial condition, operating and capital requirements, and other factors the board considers relevant. We may never
pay any dividends. Unless we pay dividends, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them. 

Our
stock is a penny stock. Trading of our stock is restricted by the SEC s penny stock regulations, which may limit a stockholder s
ability to buy and sell our stock. 

Our
stock is a penny stock. The SEC has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines penny stock to be any equity security
that has a market price (as defined in Rule 15g-9) less than 5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than 5.00 per share,
subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice
requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and accredited investors . The term
 accredited investor refers generally to institutions with assets more than 5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth
over 1,000,000 or annual income exceeding 200,000 or 300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a
broker-dealer, before a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk
disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC, which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks
in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with the current bid and offer quotations for the penny
stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the
market value of each penny stock held in the customer s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and
salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must
be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer s confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require
that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written
determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to
the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market
for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of
broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest and limit the
marketability of our common stock. 

15 

The
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder s ability to buy and sell our
stock. 

In
addition to the penny stock rules promulgated by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing
that the investment is suitable for that customer. Before recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional
customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer s financial status, tax status,
investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that
speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers
to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock.

On July 31, 2024, LarCo Holdings, LLC LarCo filed a joint complaint against BIG and MetaWorks in the
Superior Court of the State of Arizona, Maricopa County, demanding a total settlement of 1,321,382 of which MetaWorks is to pay 752,500
as a partial settlement of this amount. The claim discloses MetaWorks contingent commitment to settle a portion of this loan if a specific
customer invoice is collected. The Company intends to file a motion to dismiss this claim against it, as it has never collected on the
specified invoice and the Company s agreement for partial payment of this loan was solely dependent on collecting this customer balance.
Management determined with the advice of legal counsel that it is too early to estimate the outcome of this claim.

7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Our
management s discussion and analysis provide a narrative about our financial performance and condition that should be read in
conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in this annual report. This discussion
contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations estimates and assumptions about events and trends that may
affect our future operating results or financial position. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially
from those discussed in these forward-looking statements due to several factors, including, but not limited to, those outlined in
the sections of this annual report titled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements . 

Overview 

Our
business is a services and development business that provides a turnkey set of services for companies to develop and integrate blockchain
and payment technologies into their business operations. We anticipate that we will enable companies to focus on their core competencies
while providing the necessary resources and expertise to execute a strategy that will enable companies to integrate new blockchain-plus
payment technologies into their business operations. Our plan is to be compensated on a fee-for-service model, technology licensing
model and reoccurring transactions revenue model. We may accept tokens, coins or equity in payment for our services, to the extent permitted
under applicable law. 

Results
of Operations 

Revenue 

We recognized total revenue of 415,082 with 5,082
coming from the sale of NFTs, 330,000 from consulting services, and 80,000 from the sale of movie rights for the year ended December
31, 2023, compared to 1,835,773 for the year ended December 31, 2022 which is comprised of 81,023 from NFT sales, 504,750 from consulting
services and 1,250,000 from the sale of movie rights. 

Operating
Expenses 

We incurred operating expenses of 2,804,222 and 5,528,831
for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively, representing a decrease of 2,724,609 between the two periods. These expenses
consisted primarily of consulting fees, service costs, professional fees, stock-based compensation, interest and bank charges, and other
general and administrative expenses. The decrease in operating expenses between the years 2023 and 2022 is principally due to a decrease
in other general and administrative expenses. Consulting expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were 943,382 and 948,013,
respectively, a decrease of 4,031. Professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were 222,570 and 210,093, respectively,
an increase of 12,477. Professional fees increased as a result of legal and consulting services relating to financing agreements. Project
costs in the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were 439,648 and 1,239,077, respectively, a decrease of 799,429. Some projects requiring
these services were scaled back, additionally, projects were managed more efficiently to reduce costs. 

Net Loss from Operations 

We incurred net losses from operations of 2,389,140
and 3,693,058 for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively, representing a decrease of 1,303,918 primarily attributable
to the factors discussed above under the heading Operating Expenses . 

Other Income (Expense) 

Other income (expense) for the year ended December
31, 2023, includes 0 of expenses compared to 7,287 of costs associated with notes payable for the year ended December 31, 2022, on notes
receivable to a related party. Other income includes interest revenue on notes receivable of 397,592 for the year ended December 31,
2023, compared to 117,721 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Other expenses include interest expense on notes payable of 253,473
for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 6,601 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The change in fair value of the derivative
liability from warrants issued and outstanding resulted in a 440,065 gain in 2022. There was no change in derivative liability value
determined on December 31, 2023, it remained at zero principally due to the decline in the Company s stock price. During 2022 the intangible
asset (movie rights) was impaired resulting in a loss of 2,625,000. The distributor s movie sales in 2022 resulted in a loss. Using
this recent financial performance, the Company was unable to project future cash flows based on its percentage earnings of the distributor s
gross receipts less certain costs. For the year ended December 31, 2023, there was a write-off of uncollectable receivables for 195,688
compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, there was a loss from a partial write-off of the investment in sBetOne for 430,005.

Operating
Activities 

Net cash used in operating activities was 1,023,047 for the year ended December
31, 2023, as compared to 1,222,773 for the year ended December 31, 2022, resulting in a decrease of 199,726 in net cash used. The decrease
in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to a decreased net loss for the period. 

Financing
Activities 

Financing activities provided cash of 991,182 for the year ended December
31, 2023, and 690,684 for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 300,498. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the change
was principally due to cash proceeds from notes payable, issuance of convertible notes and share issuances. During the year ended December
31, 2022, the change was principally due to cash proceeds from notes payable and share issuances. 

Cash
Requirements 

We
expect that we will require 1,200,000, including our current working capital, to fund our operating expenditures for the next twelve
months. Projected working capital requirements for the next twelve months are as follows: 

Estimated
Working Capital Expenditures During the Next Twelve Months 

General and administrative expenses 
 1,200,000 
 
 Total 
 1,200,000 

Our
estimated general and administrative expenses for the next 12 months are 1,200,000 and are comprised of: consulting fees, accounting
services, board of directors and our advisory board, investor relations consultants, and to our public relations and marketing consultants;
legal and professional fees (including auditing fees); for insurance; marketing and advertising expenses; trade shows; travel expenses;
office rent and miscellaneous and office expenses. 

We
will require additional cash resources to meet our planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements for the next 12 months.
We expect to derive such cash through the sale of equity or debt securities or by obtaining a credit facility. The sale of additional
equity securities will result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness will result in debt service obligations,
which could cause additional dilution to our stockholders, and could require us to agree to financial covenants that could restrict our
operations or modify our plans to source a new business opportunity. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable
to us, if at all. Failure to raise additional funds could cause our company to fail. 

19 

Going
Concern 

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared
using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization
of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have not yet established a source of revenues sufficient
to cover our operating costs and to allow us to continue as a going concern. We have incurred losses since inception resulting in an accumulated
deficit on December 31, 2023 and 2022 of 47,078,270 and 41,428,167, respectively. Net losses for the year ended December 31, 2023 and
2022 were 5,664,278 and 6,204,165, respectively. Our ability to operate as a going concern is dependent on obtaining adequate capital
to fund operating losses until we become profitable. 

In
its report on our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, our independent registered public accounting firm
included an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

 MetaWorks
Platforms, Inc 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MetaWorks Platforms, Inc the Company , MetaWorks as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity (deficit),
and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related notes and schedules (collectively referred to as the financial
statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company
as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going
Concern Uncertainty 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
1 to the financial statements, the Company s losses from operations and accumulated deficit raise substantial doubt about its
ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1 . The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical
Audit Matters 

The
critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. The communication of critical audit matters
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Complex
Accounting Treatments - Financing Transactions 

Description
of the Matter: 

As
discussed in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s financing transactions include warrants
that are denominated in a currency other than the Company s functional currency which requires derivative accounting. During 2023,
the Company issued convertible notes and conversion features required derivative accounting. Derivative accounting is complex, involves
judgements, and estimations. 

How
We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit: 

We
examined on a sample basis the underlying warrant and note payable agreements, evaluated management s selection of a valuation
method, tested the inputs used in the Black-Scholes calculation by agreeing terms to the agreements, we retrieved market information
on third-party sites, and recalculated the derivative liability. 

Complex
judgements - NFT Revenue Recognition 

Description
of the Matter: 

As
discussed in Notes 2 the valuation of NFT transactions could be subject to limited regulatory and accounting guidance. 

How
We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit: 

In
2023, NFT sales were immaterial, we scanned activity and made inquiry and analysis. For 2022, we examined the terms of the agreements
for sampled NFT sales, information from third-party sites, proof of payment and documentation that ownership of the NFT was transferred
to the purchaser. We reviewed the AICPA Practice Aid Accounting for and Auditing of Digital Assets issued on June 30, 2022
and October 1, 2023, and the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121, issued on June 15, 2022, on digital assets, to determine what
recent authoritative and nonauthoritative guidance would apply to these transactions. We evaluated as applicable ASC 606 New Revenue
Recognition Policy . Accordingly, NFT revenues were tested based on available guidance that was most applicable to the nature of
sales. 

Complex
judgements - Movie Distribution Revenue Recognition 

Description
of the Matter: 

As
discussed in Notes 2 the valuation of movie distribution sales could be subject to industry specific accounting guidance considerations. 

How
We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit: 

We
examined the terms of agreement for the movie distribution sale, information from third-party sites regarding publications on the sale,
proof of payment and documentation supporting the transfer of distribution rights to the purchaser, and records on subsequent movie revenues
sent to the Company by the purchaser. We reviewed publications on common revenue recognition guidance issues related to the movie distribution
industry from reputable sources. We evaluated as applicable ASC 606 New Revenue Recognition Policy . Accordingly, the movie
distribution revenue was tested based on available guidance that was most applicable to the nature of sales. In 2023, we obtained third
party confirmations regarding revenues earned as residual payments from the distribution sale. 

Complex
Accounting Treatments - Stock Options 

Description
of the Matter: 

As
discussed in Notes 2 and 16 the Company has stock options, which requires fair value calculations that are complex and subject
to critical judgment. 

F- 3 

How
We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit: 

We
examined stock option agreements, on a sample basis tested inputs used in the Black-Scholes calculation by agreeing terms to the agreements,
market information on third-party sites, and recalculated the stock option s fair value and stock-based compensation expense. 

Subjective
Judgement Notes Receivable 

Description
of the Matter: 

As
discussed in Note 6 the Company held significant balances as note receivables during 2023 and indirectly wrote-off these balances
on December 31, 2023, due to potential non-collections. This resulted in significant losses in the other income section of statement
of operations. 

How
We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit: 

We
examined the general ledger for the loan activity such as payments of principals, accruals and payments of interest. We examined the
related agreements and amendment to these agreements to determine if these notes were current or in default. We evaluated collectability
based on historical payments made, extensions of the maturity date and inquiry and observation of the financial condition of note holders.
We determined from our evaluation that there is a potential for non-collections and proposed entries to incur a loss and allocate a reserve.
We considered business prospects disclosed to us regarding these note holders and determined that if they are fulfilled then the note
receivable can become realizable in future periods. 

Subjective
Judgement Software 

Description
of the Matter: 

As
discussed in Note 7, during 2023, the Company capitalized the cost for software not placed in service and reported this value
at its net book value on December 31, 2023. 

How
We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit: 

We
examined the related agreement for the acquisition of the software, tested the value used in capitalization, inquired, and considered
if the software s condition met the capitalization requirements and determined if conditions existed that required impairment assessment.
We also did research on the reputation of the software s vendor in this industry, the level of costs associated with this type
of software in the industry, and we inquired on how the software will be used to generate income and researched the level of income that
could be generated from such software. Our examination provided us comfort that capitalization was done in accordance with related accounting
standards and the net book value was determined after adequate consideration and reasonable judgement. 

Consolidation 

Description
of the Matter: 

As
discussed in Notes 2 the Company has multiple subsidiaries with intercompany balances and transactions. 

How
We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit: 

We
examined detailed transactions and consolidation reports to obtain comfort that intercompany transactions and balances were properly
eliminated.

Concern

assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has incurred losses
since inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of 
and 
as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and incurred net losses of and for the year ended
December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Further losses are anticipated, as the Company pursues business
opportunities, raising substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as
a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profits, adequate cash flows and/or obtaining the necessary
financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management
intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand, loans from third parties, related party debt and proceeds from

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT D) 

FASB
Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, Income Taxes ASC 740 ), clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income
taxes recognized in the financial statements. ASC 740 provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when
it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation
processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold
to be recognized. ASC 740 also provides guidance on measurement, derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in
interim periods, disclosure and transition. We have determined that the Company does not have uncertain tax positions on its tax returns
for the years 2022, and prior. Based on our evaluation of the 2023 transactions and events, the Company does not believe it has any material
uncertain tax positions that require measurement. The 2023 tax return has not been filed as of he date of these financial statements were available for issuance,
a filing extension has been elected. 

Our
policy is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. We had no accrual for interest
or penalties on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2023 or 2022, and have not recognized interest and/or penalties in the
consolidated statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 or 2022. 

We
are subject to taxation in the U.S. and the state of California. The Company s tax returns for tax years from 2021 to recent filings
remain subject to potential examination by the tax authorities. 

allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2023 and 2022. Management individually reviews all delinquent accounts receivable balances
and based on an assessment of current creditworthiness, estimates the portion, if any, of the balance that will not be collected and
would directly write-off these balances. Management considers a number of factors, including the age of the receivables, which is
often less than 60 days, current economic conditions and other information management obtains regarding the financial condition of
customers. The policy for determining the past due status is based on the contractual payment terms of each customer. Once
collection efforts by the Company are exhausted, the determination for directly writing off uncollectible receivables is
made. 

shares of common stock and stock
options exercisable to shares of common stock. On December 31, 2022 the Company had no convertible debt outstanding, warrants
exercisable to shares of common stock and stock options exercisable to shares of common stock. For both years the
effect of exercisable options and warrants is anti-dilutive and they have been excluded from dilutive EPS.

In
assessing the ability to realize the deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or
all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation
of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled
reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. 

The
returns filed from the year 2019 going-forward are subject to examination by the IRS.

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by our
company is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Our principal
executive officer, who is our president, and our principal financial officer, who is our chief financial officer, are responsible for
establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures for our company. 

Our
management conducted an evaluation, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, of
the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and
our principal financial officer concluded that as a result of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting
described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2022. 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
principal executive officer and our principal financial officer are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting. Our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer have assessed the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K based on the criteria
for effective internal control described Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of
the Treadway Commission 2013. Based on this assessment, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer have concluded
our internal control over the financial reporting is not effective due to the following material weaknesses, which existed as of December
31, 2023: 

Financial
 Reporting Systems : We did not maintain a fully integrated financial reporting system throughout the period and as a result, extensive
 manual analysis, reconciliation and adjustments were required in order to produce financial statements for external reporting purposes;
 and 

Segregation
 of Duties : We do not currently have a sufficient complement of technical accounting and external reporting personnel commensurate
 to support standalone external financial reporting under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP or SEC requirements. Specifically, we did not effectively segregate certain accounting duties due to the small size of our accounting
 staff, and inability to maintain a sufficient number of adequately trained personnel who have the knowledge and experience with U.S.
 GAAP and SEC reporting necessary to anticipate and identify risks critical to financial reporting and the closing process. In addition,
 there were inadequate reviews and approvals by our personnel of certain reconciliations and other processes in day-to-day operations
 due to the lack of a full complement of accounting staff. 

We
believe that our material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures relate in
part to the fact that we are an emerging business with limited personnel. Management and our board of directors believe that we must
allocate additional human and financial resources to address these matters. Throughout the year, we have been continuously improving
our monitoring of current reporting systems and our personnel. We intend to continue to make improvements in our internal control over
financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures until our material weaknesses are remediated. 

Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Controls and Permitted Omission from Management s Assessment 

Our
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. All internal control systems, no matter
how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls.
Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

In
light of the material weaknesses described above, additional procedures were performed by our management to ensure that the consolidated
financial statements included in this report were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting during the Fourth Quarter of 2022 

During
the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022, there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that have materially
affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

9B. OTHER INFORMATION

Code
of Ethics 

On
December 20, 2017, our board of directors adopted a code of ethics and business conduct for directors, senior officers and employees
of our company. We adopted the code of ethics and business conduct for the purpose of promoting: 

honest
 and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest; 

full,
 fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in all reports and documents that we file with, or submits to, the Securities
 and Exchange Commission and in other public communications made by our company; 

compliance
 with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations; 

the
 protection of our assets, including corporate opportunities and confidential information; 

fair
 dealing practices; 

the
 prompt internal reporting of violations of the code of ethics and business conduct; and 

accountability
 for adherence to the code of ethics and business conduct. 

Audit
Committee 

We
have an audit committee consisting of James P. Geiskopf, Edmund C. Moy, and Shelly Murphy. Our audit committee assists our board of directors
in fulfilling its responsibility to our stockholders relating to corporate accounting matters, the financial reporting practices of our
company, and the quality and integrity of the financial reports of our company. 

Audit
Committee Financial Expert 

Our
board of directors has determined that it does not have a member that qualifies as an audit committee financial expert 
as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K. We believe that our board of directors is capable of analyzing and evaluating our
financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. In addition, we believe that retaining
an independent director who would qualify as an audit committee financial expert would be overly costly and burdensome
and is not warranted in our circumstances given the early stages of our development. 

Other
Committees of Board of Directors 

We
do not have nominating or compensation committees or committees performing similar functions nor do we have a written nominating or compensation
committee charter. Our board of directors does not believe that it is necessary to have such committees because it believes that the
functions of such committees can be adequately performed by our board of directors. 

We
do not have any defined policy or procedure requirements for our stockholders to submit recommendations or nominations for directors.
We do not currently have any specific or minimum criteria for the election of nominees to our board of directors and we do not have any
specific process or procedure for evaluating such nominees. Our board of directors assesses all candidates, whether submitted by management
or stockholders, and makes recommendations for election or appointment. 

A
stockholder who wishes to communicate with our board of directors may do so by directing a written request to the address appearing on
the first page of this annual report.

Compensation
for Executive Officers and Directors 

For
information regarding compensation for our executive officers and directors, see Executive Compensation . 

Director
Independence 

We
currently act with four directors consisting of Cameron Chell, James P. Geiskopf, Edmund C. Moy, and Shelly Murphy. Our common stock
is quoted on the OTCQB operated by the OTC Markets Group, which does not impose any director independence requirements. Under NASDAQ
Rule 5605(a)(2), a director is not independent if, among other things, (1) he or she is also an executive officer or employee of the
corporation or was, at any time during the past three years, employed by the corporation; or (2) he or she accepted or who has a family
member who accepted any compensation from our company in excess of 120,000 during any period of twelve consecutive months within the
past three years, other than the following: (i) compensation for board or board committee service; (ii) compensation paid to a family
member who is an employee (other than an executive officer) of our company; or (iii) benefits under a tax-qualified retirement plan,
or non-discretionary compensation. Using this definition of independent director, we have three independent directors, James Geiskopf,
Edmund C. Moy, and Shelly Murphy. 

In
addition, James P. Geiskopf, Edmund C. Moy, and Shelly Murphy, the members of our audit committee, have not accepted directly or indirectly
any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from our company or subsidiary other than in his or her capacity as a member of the
audit committee, our board of directors, or any other board committee, and each member of our audit committee is not a beneficial owner,
directly or indirectly, of more than 10 of our common stock and is not an executive officer of our company. Accordingly, they are independent
under independence standards applicable to the audit committee of a company whose stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market.

Pre-Approval
Policies and Procedures 

Our
audit committee pre-approves all services provided by our independent registered public accountants. All of the above services and fees
were reviewed and approved by our board of directors or our audit committee before the respective services were rendered. 

Our
board of directors has considered the nature and amount of fees billed by our independent registered public accountants and believes
that the provision of services for activities unrelated to the audit is compatible with maintaining the independence of our independent
registered public accountants.

 Consultant shall hold all the benefits of the rights, title and interest mentioned above in trust for the Company prior to the assignment

 against the Company, any of the Company s successors in interest, or any of the Company s customers.

 Consultant agrees to perform, during and after the Term, all acts that the Company deems necessary or desirable to permit and assist
 the Company, at its expense, in obtaining, perfecting and enforcing the full benefits, enjoyment, rights and title throughout the
 world in the Company Innovations as provided to the Company under this Agreement. If the Company is unable for any reason to secure
 the Consultant s signature to any document required to file, prosecute, register or memorialize the assignment of any rights
 under any Company Innovations as provided under this Agreement, the Consultant hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Company
 and the Company s duly authorized officers and agents as the Consultant s agents and attorneys-in-fact to act for and
 on the Consultant s behalf and instead of the Consultant to take all lawfully permitted acts to further the filing, prosecution,
 registration, memorialization of assignment, issuance and enforcement of rights in, to and under the Company Innovations, all with
 the same legal force and effect as if executed by the Consultant. The foregoing is deemed a power coupled with an interest and is

 to practice, creation, derivation, development or making of the Innovation, to the Company s business or actual or demonstrably
 anticipated research or development but which were conceived, reduced to practice, created, derived, developed or made by the Consultant
 (solely or jointly) either unrelated to the Consultant s work for Company under this Agreement or prior to the Effective Date
 (collectively, the Out-of-Scope Innovations into any of the Company Innovations, then the Consultant hereby
 grants to the Company and the Company s designees a royalty-free, transferable, irrevocable, worldwide, fully paid-up license
 (with rights to sublicense through multiple tiers of sublicensees) to fully use, practice and exploit all patent, copyright, moral
 right, mask work, trade secret and other intellectual property rights relating to the Out-of-Scope Innovations. Notwithstanding the
 foregoing, the Consultant agrees that the Consultant shall not incorporate, or permit to be incorporated, any Innovations conceived,

8. 
 GENERAL 

8.1 
 This
 Agreement contains the entire Agreement and obligation between the Parties with respect to its subject matter. No amendment to this
 Agreement will be valid or effective unless in writing and signed by both Parties. 

8.2 
 The
 Parties agree that the Consultant s obligations under this Agreement are of a unique character that gives them particular value,
 and that the Consultant s breach of any of these obligations will cause irreparable and continuing damage to the Company for
 which money damages are insufficient. The Company is entitled to injunctive relief, a decree for specific performance, and all other
 relief as may be proper (including money damages if appropriate), without the need to post a bond. 

8.3 
 The
 Consultant acknowledges that the restrictions contained in Section 5, 6 and 7 are, in view of the nature of the Business of the Company,
 reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the Company, that the Company would not have entered into this Agreement
 in the absence of such restrictions and that any violation of any provision of those Sections could result in irreparable injury
 to the Company. The Consultant agrees that, in the event it violates any of the restrictions referred to in Section 5, 6 and 7, the
 Company shall be entitled to such injunctive relief or other remedies at law or in equity which the Court deems fit. 

8.4 
 The
 Consultant expressly acknowledges that this Agreement is reasonable and valid in all respects and irrevocably waives (and irrevocably
 agrees not to raise) as a defence any issue of reasonableness in any proceeding to enforce any provision of this Agreement, the intention
 of the Parties being to provide for the legitimate and reasonable protection of the interests of the Company by providing, without
 limitation, for the broadest scope, the longest duration and the widest territory allowable by law. 

8.5 
 The
 Consultant agrees to indemnify the Company from all losses, claims, actions, damages, assessments or demands (including reasonable
 legal fees and expenses) which result from negligent acts or omissions of the Consultant in providing the Services. Notwithstanding
 the foregoing, the Company agrees that the Consultant will be covered by the Company s Directors Officers and Employment
 Practices Liability Insurance, once such insurance is obtained by the Company.

 notice, request, demand or other communication hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered as follows, with notice deemed
 given as indicated: (a) by personal delivery, when actually delivered; (b) by overnight courier, upon written verification of receipt;

 hours, then on the recipient s next business day; or (e) by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, upon verification
 of receipt. Notice shall be sent to the addresses set forth on the first page of this Agreement or to such other address as either
 Party may advise the other in writing from time to time in accordance with this Section 8.6.

8.7 
 Each
 Party will be responsible for all of its own expenses, legal and other professional fees, disbursements, and all other costs incurred
 in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and all documents and instruments relating
 hereto. The Parties agree that they have had adequate opportunity to seek independent legal advice with respect to the subject matter
 of this Agreement, and have either obtained such advice or consciously chosen not to do so with full knowledge of the risks associated
 with not obtaining such legal advice. 

8.8 
 If
 any provision of this Agreement, including as to term or geographical area, is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under
 present or future laws by any court of competent jurisdiction, such illegality, invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the
 legality, enforceability or validity of any other provisions of this Agreement or of the same provision as applied to any other fact
 or circumstance, and such illegal, unenforceable or invalid provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make such
 provision legal, valid or enforceable. 

8.9 
 Time
 shall be of the essence of this Agreement. 

8.10 
 The
 Consultant may not sell, assign or transfer any rights or interests created under this Agreement or delegate any of the Consultant s
 duties without the prior written consent of the Company. 

8.11

 Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of British Columbia, and the federal laws
 of Canada applicable therein, and each Party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of courts of competent jurisdiction
 in the Province of British Columbia.

 Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together
 shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument. Counterparts may be executed either in original or electronic form and
