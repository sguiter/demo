 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDEN SED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

million as well as negative cash flows from operating activities. Presently, the Company does not have sufficient cash resources to meet its plans for the next twelve months following the issuance of these financial statements. The Company will continue to require substantial funds to continue research and development, including clinical trials of its product candidates. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance of these financial statements. Management s plans in order to meet its operating cash flow requirements include seeking additional collaborative agreements for certain of its programs as well as financing activities such as public offerings and private placements of its common stock, preferred stock offerings, issuances of debt and convertible debt instruments. There are no assurances that such additional funding will be obtained and that the Company will succeed in its future operations. If the Company cannot successfully raise additional capital and implement its strategic development plan, its liquidity, financial condition and business prospects will be materially and adversely affected, and the Company may have to cease operations. As further described in Note 6, the Company classified the remaining balance of its term loan as a current liability on the Company s balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary in the event the Company can no longer continue as a going concern.

Options to purchase approximately million and million shares of common stock were excluded from the denominator in the calculation of diluted net loss share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as the effect would be anti-dilutive. Options to purchase approximately million and million shares of common stock were excluded from the denominator in the calculation of diluted net loss per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, as the effect would be anti-dilutive. Both the pre-funded warrants and the common warrants to purchase shares of common stock entitle the holders thereof to participate in dividends and other distributions of assets by the Company to its holders of common shares, but are not required to absorb losses incurred. As a result, all warrants were excluded from basic net loss per share calculations during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For diluted net loss per share purposes, warrants are included in the number of shares outstanding if the effect is dilutive. T he dilutive effect of pre-funded warrants was shares and shares for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively . Additional common warrants to purchase million shares were excluded from the denominator in the calculation of diluted net loss share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as the effect would be anti-dilutive.

million in the aggregate, depending on the achievement of certain regulatory, commercial, and intellectual property milestones with respect to POSIMIR. There were revenues recognized related to the Innocoll Agreement for the three and nine months periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and none of the agreement milestones have been met. On November 8, 2024, the Company received notice that Innocoll is terminating the Innocoll Agreement, effective May 6, 2025. Innocoll has committed to transfer all data and know-how related to POSIMIR to the Company, and the Company is evaluating next steps with respect to the commercialization of POSIMIR. Patent Purchase Agreement with Indivior In September 2017, we entered into an agreement with Indivior (the Indivior Agreement ), under which we assigned to Indivior certain patents that may provide further intellectual property protection for PERSERIS, Indivior s extended-release injectable suspension for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. In consideration for such assignment, Indivior made non-refundable upfront and milestone payments to DURECT totaling million. Additionally, under the terms of the agreement with Indivior, the Company is entitled to receive quarterly earn-out payments into 2026 based on a single digit percentage of U.S. net sales of PERSERIS. Indivior commercially launched PERSERIS in the U.S. in February 2019. The Indivior Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and indemnities of the parties. Amounts recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 related to earn-out revenues from PERSERIS have been immaterial and are included in collaborative research and development and other revenue . In July 2024, Indivior announced discontinuation of sales and marketing for PERSERIS due to the highly competitive market and impending changes that are expected to intensify payor management in the treatment category in which PERSERIS participates.

There were securities that have had an unrealized loss for more than 12 months as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, unrealized losses on available-for-sale investments are not attributed to credit risk and are considered to be temporary. The Company believes that it is more-likely-than-not that investments in an unrealized loss position will be held until maturity or the recovery of the cost basis of the investment. To date, the Company has not recorded any impairment charges on marketable securities related to other-than-temporary declines in market value. Warrant Liabilities

February 2023 Warrants In February 2023, the Company issued pre-funded warrants to purchase an aggregate of shares of common stock and common warrants to purchase an aggregate of shares of common stock in a registered direct offering. Pre-Funded Warrants The pre-funded warrants were accounted for as current liabilities on the balance sheets and were adjusted to estimated fair value at period end through other income (expense) on the statements of operations. The estimated fair value of the outstanding pre-funded warrants was million, and as of February 8, 2023 (i.e., the issuance date), December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively. In November 2023, all shares of the pre-funded warrants were exercised in accordance with the financing agreement, resulting in an issuance of shares of common stock to the holder.

Common Warrants The common warrants are accounted for as current liabilities on the balance sheets and are adjusted to estimated fair value at period end through other income (expense) on the statements of operations. The estimated fair value of the outstanding common warrants was million, and as of February 8, 2023 (i.e., the issuance date), December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively. In September 2023, shares of the common warrants were exercised through the alternative cashless exercise provision in accordance with the financing agreement, resulting in a net issuance of shares to the holder. The aggregate number of shares of our common stock issuable in such alternative cashless exercise equals the product of (x)

. The Company calculated the estimated fair value of the common warrants using a Monte Carlo simulation model with the following key assumptions. The Company took the likelihood of achieving certain clinical events and related impact on the Company's common stock price into account, as appropriate. The exercise price for the outstanding common warrants (i.e., shares) was adjusted down from per share to per share as of December 31, 2023 as a result of an anti-dilution provision in the common warrants issued in the February 2023 financing that was triggered by the sale of our common stock in the open market in November 2023. There were shares of outstanding common warrants as of September 30, 2024.

The estimated fair value of the outstanding common warrants was million, and million as of July 21, 2023 (i.e., the issuance date), December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively.

million secured single-draw term loan (as amended, the Loan Agreement with Oxford Finance LLC Oxford Finance ). The Company and Oxford Finance entered into five subsequent amendments to the Loan Agreement in February 2018, November 2018, December 2019, March 2021 and May 2021. For amendments 1-3 and 5, the Company paid Oxford Finance loan modification fees of , , and , respectively. and continuing through the maturity date of the term loan of . The Loan Agreement provides for a floating interest rate initially and as of September 30, 2024) based on . In addition, a payment equal to of the principal amount of the term loan is due when the term loan becomes due or upon the prepayment of the facility. If the Company elects to prepay the loan, there is also a prepayment fee of between and of the principal amount of the term loan depending on the timing of prepayment. The facility fee that was paid at the original closing, the loan modification fees and other debt offering/issuance costs have been recorded as debt discount on the Company s balance sheets and together with the final million payment are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the revised term of the loan. The Company made principal payments of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with million and million for the corresponding periods in 2023, respectively. The term loan is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company, except that the collateral does not include any intellectual property (including licensing, collaboration and similar agreements relating thereto), and certain other excluded assets. The Loan Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants by the Company, which covenants limit the Company s ability to convey, sell, lease, transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of certain assets of the Company; engage in any business other than the businesses currently engaged in by the Company or reasonably related thereto; liquidate or dissolve; make certain management changes; undergo certain change of control events; create, incur, assume, or be liable with respect to certain indebtedness; grant certain liens; pay dividends and make certain other restricted payments; make certain investments; and make payments on any subordinated debt. The Loan Agreement also contains customary indemnification obligations and customary events of default, including, among other things, the Company s failure to fulfill certain obligations of the Company under the Loan Agreement and the occurrence of a material adverse change which is defined as a material adverse change in the Company s business, operations, or condition (financial or otherwise), a material impairment of the prospect of repayment of any portion of the loan, or a material impairment in the perfection or priority of lender s lien in the collateral or in the value of such collateral. In the event of default by the Company under the Loan Agreement, the lender would be entitled to exercise its remedies thereunder, including the right to accelerate the debt, upon which the Company may be required to repay all amounts then outstanding under the Loan Agreement, which could harm the Company s financial condition. The conditionally exercisable call option related to the event of default is considered to be an embedded derivative which is required to be bifurcated and accounted for as a separate financial instrument. In the periods presented, the value of the embedded derivative is not material, but could become material in future periods if an event of default became more probable than is currently estimated. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all material covenants under the Loan Agreement and there had been no material adverse change. In accordance with ASC 470-10-45-2, the term loan was classified as a current liability on the Company s balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 due to the timing of repayment obligations and due to recurring losses, liquidity concerns and a subjective acceleration clause in the Company s Loan Agreement.

million of securities from time to time in one or more public offerings, inclusive of up to million of shares of the Company s common stock which the Company could sell, subject to certain limitations, pursuant to a sales agreement dated July 30, 2021 with Cantor Fitzgerald Co. (the 2021 Sales Agreement ). The 2021 Registration Statement expired on August 16, 2024. On August 14, 2024, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC (the 2024 Registration Statement (File No. 333-281550), which upon being declared effective on August 23, 2024, allowed us to offer up to million of securities from time to time in one or more public offerings. In addition, due to the SEC s baby shelf rules, which prohibit companies with a public float of less than million from issuing securities under a shelf registration statement in excess of one-third of such company s public float in a 12-month period, we are currently only able to issue a limited number of shares under our 2024 Registration Statement, which aggregate to no more than one-third of our public float. Registered Direct Offerings February 2023 Financing , the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with two institutional investors relating to the purchase and sale of an aggregate of (i) shares of its common stock, par value per share, (ii) pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of common stock, and (iii) accompanying common warrants, to purchase an aggregate of shares of common stock, in a registered direct offering (the February Offering . The issuance date of the common stock, the pre-funded warrants and the accompanying common warrants was February 8, 2023. The aggregate net proceeds to the Company from the February Offering were approximately million after deducting million in placement agent fees and other offering expenses, which were allocated to warrant liabilities and included in loss on issuance of warrants on the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023. The pre-funded warrants were exercisable immediately following the closing date of the February Offering and have an unlimited term and an initial exercise price of per share. The common warrants were immediately exercisable and have a term and an initial exercise price of per share, which was lowered to per share as a result of an anti-dilution provision in the common warrants issued in the February Offering that was triggered by the July Offering (as defined below) and then 

 20 

that was triggered by the sale of our common stock in the open market in November 2023. The combined offering price was per share and accompanying common warrant, or in the case of pre-funded warrants, per pre-funded warrant and accompanying common warrant. A holder (together with its affiliates) may not exercise any portion of a pre-funded warrant or common warrant to the extent that the holder would own more than (or, at the election of the holder of the Company s outstanding common stock immediately after exercise. The Company accounts for the pre-funded warrants and the common warrants as current liabilities based upon the guidance of ASC 480 and ASC 815. The Company evaluated the common and pre-funded warrants under ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity ASC 815-40 and concluded that they do not meet the criteria to be classified in stockholders equity. Specifically, the exercise of the pre-funded warrants could be settled in cash upon the occurrence of a tender offer or exchange that involves 50 or more of the Company s common stock. Because a change of 50 or more of the Company s common stock may not result in a change in control of the Company, the Company believes that the scope exception related to the occurrence of a fundamental transaction in ASC 815-40 is not met. The common warrants have the same characteristics as the pre-funded warrants related to the occurrence of a fundamental transaction, therefore the common warrants are also precluded from equity classification. In addition, the holder of the common warrants is permitted to receive the highest volume weighted average price ("VWAP") from the date of announcement of the fundamental transaction through the date the holder provides notice of repurchase, as a way to protect the holder against reductions in the stock price in a fundamental transaction, while allowing the holder to keep the benefits of an upside, which precludes the common warrants from being considered indexed to the Company s stock. Since the common and pre-funded warrants meet the definition of derivatives under ASC 815, the Company recorded these warrants as current liabilities on the balance sheets at the estimated fair value, with subsequent changes in their respective estimated fair values recognized in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss at each reporting date. Estimating fair values of liability-classified financial instruments requires the development of estimates that may, and are likely to, change over the duration of the instrument with related changes in internal and external market factors. In addition, option-based techniques are highly volatile and sensitive to changes in the trading market price of the Company s common stock. Because liability-classified financial instruments are initially and subsequently carried at fair value, the Company s financial results will reflect the volatility in these estimate and assumption changes. Changes in estimated fair value are recognized as a component of other income (expense) in the statements of operations. At the date of issuance, the Company valued the common warrants using a Monte-Carlo valuation model due to the presence of an alternative cashless settlement feature in the financing agreement that provides the warrant holders with an alternative settlement feature to receive a fixed percentage of the shares underlying the warrants for no consideration. Because this feature allows for the warrant holders to use an alternative mechanism to exercise their warrants in a manner that would yield different values, a Monte-Carlo valuation model was determined to be appropriate. The Monte-Carlo valuation resulted in an estimated fair value of the common warrants at issuance of million. The pre-funded warrants were valued using the Black-Scholes option valuation model which is a common valuation method that is generally used for valuing warrants that are for the exercise of a fixed number of shares at a fixed exercise price per share. The Black-Scholes method was determined to be appropriate for the pre-funded warrants given the lack of alternative mechanisms to settle the warrants in a manner that would yield different values, such as an alternative cashless settlement feature. The Black-Scholes valuation resulted in an estimated fair value of the pre-funded warrants at issuance of million. Since the estimated fair value of the warrants at issuance was greater than the gross proceeds of million received, the Company recorded approximately million (i.e., the difference of the estimated fair values of the warrants and the gross proceeds received) as a loss on issuance of warrants on the statements of operations at issuance. In September 2023, shares of the common warrants were exercised in connection with the alternative cashless exercise of the warrants and the Company issued shares to the holder. The Company recorded a gain of million resulting from the exercise of the warrants in the accompanying statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 and recorded million in additional-paid-in capital upon the issuance of the shares on the balance sheets as of December 31, 2023. In November 2023, shares of the pre-funded warrants were exercised in connection with the cashless exercise of the warrants and the Company issued shares to the holder. The Company recorded a gain of resulting from the exercise of the pre-funded warrants in the accompanying statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 and recorded in additional-paid-in capital upon the issuance of the shares on the balance sheets as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, common warrants to purchase shares of the Company's common stock were outstanding with an exercise price of per share. At September 30, 2024, the Company updated the estimated fair value of the outstanding common warrants using a Monte-Carlo valuation model resulting in an estimated fair value of , an increase of for these common warrants compared to the estimated fair value at December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were pre-funded warrants outstanding.

in common warrants and the gain of million in common warrants and pre-funded warrants resulting from the change in the estimated fair value of the liabilities for such warrants were recorded as a change in the estimated fair value of warrant liabilities in the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The loss of in common warrants and the gain of million in common warrants and pre-funded warrants resulting from the change in the estimated fair value of the liabilities for such warrants was recorded as a change in the estimated fair value of warrant liabilities in the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The common warrant liability will be adjusted to estimated fair value at each balance sheet date until the warrants are settled. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrant liabilities are recognized as a component of other income (expense), net in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss. July 2023 Financing , the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with several institutional investors relating to the purchase and sale of an aggregate of (i) shares of its common stock, par value per share, and (ii) accompanying common warrants to purchase an aggregate of shares of common stock, in a registered direct offering (the July Offering ). The issuance date of the common stock and the accompanying common warrants was . The aggregate net proceeds to the Company from the July Offering were approximately million after deducting million in placement agent fees and other offering expenses. The common warrants were immediately exercisable and have a term and an initial exercise price of per share. The combined offering price was per share and accompanying common warrant. A holder (together with its affiliates) may not exercise any portion of the common warrants to the extent that the holder would own more than (or, at the election of the holder of the Company s outstanding common stock immediately after exercise. The common stock and common warrants are separate freestanding instruments. The estimated fair value of the common stock issued in the July Offering as of the date of issuance (i.e., July 21, 2023) was million, which was the number of shares of multiplied by the price per share as of the date of issuance of per share. The common stock issued in the July Offering was classified as equity on the Company s balance sheets. The Company allocated the offering expenses related to the July 2023 offering of million based on the relative fair values of common stock and common warrants issued. The Company recognized an expense for the amount allocated to the common warrants of (included within other expense, net) upon the closing of the July Offering in the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company recorded the amount allocated to the common stock of as a reduction in additional paid-in capital on its balance sheets as of December 31, 2023. The Company accounted for the common warrants issued in the July Offering as current liabilities based upon the guidance of ASC 815. The Company evaluated the common warrants under ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity ASC 815-40 and concluded that they do not meet the criteria to be classified in stockholders equity. Upon a fundamental transaction, holders of the common warrants are permitted to settle warrants for a value determined using the Black Scholes formula that incorporates a leveraged common stock price. Specifically, for purposes of the calculation, the stock price is determined as the higher of the VWAP measured over the period from the date of announcement of the fundamental transaction through the date the holder provides notice of repurchase, and the value received by common stockholders in such fundamental transaction. This in effect protects the holder against reductions in the stock price that may result from a fundamental transaction, while allowing the holder to keep the benefits of an upside. This feature precludes the common warrants from being considered indexed to the Company s stock. Since the common warrants meet the definition of derivatives under ASC 815, the Company recorded these warrants as current liabilities on the balance sheets at the estimated fair value, with subsequent changes in their respective estimated fair values recognized in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss at each reporting date. Estimating fair values of liability-classified financial instruments requires the development of estimates that may, and are likely to, change over the duration of the instrument with related changes in internal and external market factors.

The Company valued the common warrants issued in the July Offering using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The Black-Scholes method was determined to be appropriate given the lack of alternative mechanisms to settle the warrants in a manner that would yield different values, such as an alternative cashless settlement feature. The estimated fair value of these warrants as of the issuance date and as of December 31, 2023 was million and , respectively.

ne of the warrants issued in the July Offering have been exercised. Common warrants to purchase shares of the Company's common stock were outstanding with an exercise price of per share. At September 30, 2024, the Company updated the estimated fair value of the outstanding common warrants using the Black-Scholes option valuation model resulting in an estimated fair value of million, an increase of million for these common warrants compared to the estimated fair value at December 31, 2023. The loss of and million resulting from the change in the estimated fair value of the liabilities for the warrants was recorded as a change in the estimated fair value of warrant liabilities in the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The common warrant liability will be adjusted to estimated fair value at each balance sheet date until the warrants are settled. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrant liabilities are recognized as a component of other income (expense), net in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The pre-funded warrants and the common warrants issued in the February Offering and the July Offering in 2023 are participating securities which, by definition, entitle the holders thereof to participate in dividends and other distributions of assets by the Company to its holders of common shares as though the holder then held common shares. ATM Financings During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no sales of the Company's common stock in the open market. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company raised net proceeds (net of commissions) of approximately from the sale of shares of the Company s common stock in the open market at a weighted average price of per share pursuant to the 2021 Registration Statement and the 2021 Sales Agreement. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, there were no sales of the Company's common stock in the open market. As of November 11, 2024, the Company had up to million of the Company s securities available for sale under the 2024 Registration Statement. However, due to the SEC s baby shelf rules discussed above, only up to approximately million of our securities are available for sale under the 2024 Registration Statement.

 Overview 
 We are a biopharmaceutical company advancing novel and potentially lifesaving investigational therapies derived from our Epigenetic Regulator Program. Larsucosterol, a new chemical entity in clinical development, is the lead candidate in our Epigenetic Regulator Program. An endogenous, orally bioavailable small molecule, larsucosterol has been shown in both in vitro and in vivo studies to play an important regulatory role in lipid metabolism, stress and inflammatory responses, and cell death and survival. We are developing larsucosterol for alcohol-associated hepatitis AH ), a life-threatening acute liver condition with no approved therapeutics and 28-Day and 90-Day historical mortality rates of 20 -26 and 29 -31 , respectively. After completing a Phase 2a trial in which 100 of AH patients treated with larsucosterol survived the 28-Day study period, we conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial called AHFIRM (trial in AH to evaluate saFety and effIcacy of laRsucosterol treatMent). Through our AHFIRM trial, we evaluated larsucosterol s potential to reduce mortality or liver transplantation compared to a placebo with or without steroids at the investigators discretion. In total, we enrolled 307 patients at leading hospitals in the U.S., Australia, E.U. and U.K. In November 2023, we announced topline data from the AHFIRM trial that showed a compelling efficacy signal in favor of larsucosterol in the key secondary endpoint of mortality at 90 days. Both the 30 mg and 90 mg larsucosterol doses demonstrated clinically meaningful trends in reduction of mortality at 90 days with mortality reductions of 41 (p=0.068) in the 30 mg arm and 35 (p=0.124) in the 90 mg arm compared with placebo. The numerical improvement in the primary endpoint of mortality or liver transplant at 90 days did not achieve statistical significance for either dose of larsucosterol. Both doses of larsucosterol in AHFIRM showed a more pronounced reduction in mortality in patients enrolled in the U.S., representing 76 of patients enrolled in the trial. The reductions in mortality at 90 days were 57 (p=0.014) in the 30 mg arm and 58 (p=0.008) in the 90 mg arm compared with placebo in the U.S. Larsucosterol was safe and well tolerated. There were fewer treatment-emergent adverse events TEAEs in the larsucosterol arms compared with placebo. In May 2024, we announced that the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation ("BTD") to larsucosterol for the treatment of AH. In July 2024, we held a Type B meeting with the FDA to discuss the design of our planned Phase 3 clinical trial of larsucosterol in AH that, if successful, could support a potential New Drug Application filing. In September 2024, we provided details on the design of our upcoming registrational Phase 3 trial which will evaluate larsucosterol for the treatment of patients with severe AH. The proposed Phase 3 trial design incorporates feedback from the Type B meeting held with the FDA under the BTD. It is designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study conducted in the U.S., which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of larsucosterol for the treatment of patients with severe AH. The primary outcome measure will be a 90-day survival endpoint. The Phase 3 trial is planned to enroll approximately 200 patients randomized in a 1:1 ratio across two arms: (1) larsucosterol (30 mg) or (2) placebo, which will be added to the current standard of care, with or without methylprednisolone capsules in the placebo patients at the investigators discretion. Patients enrolled in the trial will be followed for an additional 90 days to collect additional safety and outcomes data. Our plan is to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial of larsucosterol in AH, subject to obtaining sufficient funding, and present topline results within two years of initiation. We have also investigated larsucosterol in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis MASH ), previously known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH with encouraging results in a Phase 1b clinical trial and may consider further development of larsucosterol for this and other indications. 
 In addition to our Epigenetic Regulator Program, we developed a novel and proprietary post-surgical pain product called POSIMIR that utilizes our innovative SABER platform technology to enable continuous sustained delivery of bupivacaine, a non-opioid local analgesic, over three days in adults. In February 2021, POSIMIR received FDA approval for post-surgical pain reduction for up to 72 hours following arthroscopic subacromial decompression. In December 2021, we entered into a license agreement (as amended, the Innocoll Agreement with Innocoll Pharmaceuticals Limited Innocoll ), pursuant to which we granted to Innocoll an exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable right and license to develop, manufacture and commercialize POSIMIR in the United States. In September 2022, Innocoll launched POSIMIR in the U.S. On November 8, 2024, we received notice that Innocoll is terminating the Innocoll Agreement, effective May 6, 2025. Innocoll has committed to transfer all data and know-how related to POSIMIR to us, and we are evaluating next steps with respect to the commercialization of POSIMIR. We do not expect that this termination will have a material impact on our financial statements.

As a result of the assignment of certain patent rights, we have in the past received single digit sales-based earn-out payments from U.S. net sales of Indivior UK Limited Indivior s PERSERIS (risperidone) drug for schizophrenia and single-digit royalties from net sales of Orient Pharma Co., Ltd. Orient Pharma s Methydur Sustained Release Capsules Methydur for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD in Taiwan. In July 2024, Indivior announced discontinuation of sales and marketing for PERSERIS due to the highly competitive market and impending changes that are expected to intensify payor management in the treatment category in which PERSERIS participates. We do not expect that this discontinuation will have a material impact on our financial statements. We also manufacture and sell ALZET osmotic pumps used in laboratory research.

 Collaborative Research and Development and Other Revenue 
 Collaborative research and development and other revenue consists of three broad categories: (a) the recognition of upfront license payments over the period of our continuing involvement with the third party, (b) the reimbursement of qualified research expenses by third parties, (c) milestone payments in connection with our collaborative agreements and (d) royalties and earn-out payments from our agreements with third parties. 
 Product Revenues 
 We also currently generate product revenue from the sale of two product lines: 
 ALZET osmotic pumps which are used for animal research; and 

certain key excipients that are included in Methydur and one excipient that is included in POSIMIR and in a marketed animal health product. 

Because we consider our core business to be developing and commercializing pharmaceuticals, we do not intend to significantly increase our investments in or efforts to sell or market any of our existing product lines. However, we expect that we will continue to make efforts to increase our revenues related to collaborative research and development by entering into new collaborations. 
 Operating Results 
 Since our inception in 1998, we have generally had a history of operating losses. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 604.6 million as well as negative cash flows from operating activities. Our net losses were 4.3 million and 15.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with 3.0 million and 26.2 million for the corresponding periods in 2023. These losses have resulted primarily from costs incurred to research and develop our product candidates and, to a lesser extent, from selling, general and administrative costs associated with our operations and product sales. We expect our research and development expenses and our selling, general and administrative expenses in the near future to be comparable to the third quarter of 2024. We also expect to incur continuing losses and negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future. As disclosed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section, we have concluded that substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The most significant accounting estimates and assumptions relate to revenue recognition, prepaid and accrued clinical costs, prepaid and accrued manufacturing costs and valuation of warrant liabilities. Actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates. There have been no material changes to our other critical accounting estimates as compared to the disclosures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Results of Operations 
 Three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Collaborative research and development and other revenue 
 We recognize revenue from collaborative research and development activities and service contracts. We expect our collaborative research and development and other revenue to decrease in the near term due to Indivior s discontinuation of sales and marketing of PERSERIS. 
 The collaborative research and development and other revenue associated with our collaborators or counterparties were 369,000 and 1.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with 506,000 and 1.7 million for the corresponding periods in 2023. The collaborative research and development and other revenue included (a) amounts related to earn-out revenue from Indivior with respect to PERSERIS net sales; (b) feasibility programs and research and development activities funded by our collaborators and (c) royalty revenue from Orient Pharma with respect to Methydur net sales. 
 The decrease in collaborative research and development and other revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the corresponding period in 2023 was primarily due to lower earn-out revenue recognized from Indivior, partially offset by higher royalty revenue recognized from Orient Pharma. The decrease in collaborative research and development and other revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the corresponding period in 2023 was primarily due to lower revenue recognized from the feasibility agreements with other companies, partially offset by higher earn-out revenue recognized from Indivior and royalty revenue recognized from Orient Pharma. 
 Product revenue, net 
 A portion of our revenues is derived from product sales, which include our ALZET osmotic pump product line and certain excipients that are included in POSIMIR, Methydur and in a marketed animal health product. Net product revenues were 1.6 million and 4.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with 1.2 million and 4.2 million for the corresponding periods in 2023. The increases in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily attributable to higher revenue from our ALZET osmotic pump product line as a result of higher unit sales prices and higher revenue from certain excipients that are included in Methydur and in a marketed animal health product compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. 
 Cost of product revenues 
 Cost of product revenues was 513,000 and 1.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with 312,000 and 1.1 million for the corresponding periods in 2023. The increases in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to higher units sold as well as higher inventory reserve recorded for our ALZET product line and higher units sold of certain excipients that are included in Methydur and in a marketed animal health product compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. Stock-based compensation expense recognized related to cost of product revenues was 3,000 and 11,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 4,000 and 13,000 for the corresponding periods in 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had eight manufacturing employees compared with nine as of September 30, 2023. We expect the number of employees involved in manufacturing will remain consistent in the near future. 
 Research and development 
 Research and development expenses are primarily comprised of salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and other compensation costs associated with research and development personnel, overhead and facility costs, preclinical and non-clinical development costs, clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs, contract services, and other outside costs. 
 26 

Research and development expenses were 2.2 million and 8.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 7.2 million and 23.7 million for the corresponding periods in 2023. We incurred lower research and development costs associated with larsucosterol, the depot injectable programs as well as other research programs in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding periods in 2023, as more fully discussed below. Stock-based compensation expense recognized related to research and development personnel was 176,000 and 552,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 306,000 and 899,000 for the corresponding periods in 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had 17 research and development employees compared with 38 as of September 30, 2023. We expect the number of employees involved in research and development will remain consistent in the near future and that research and development expenses in the near future will be comparable with the third quarter of 2024. 
 Research and development expenses associated with our major development programs were as follows (in thousands):

Larsucosterol 
 Our research and development expenses for larsucosterol were 2.1 million and 8.4 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 6.4 million and 21.1 million for the corresponding periods in 2023. The decreases in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to lower clinical trial related expenses as we completed the AHFIRM trial and lower employee-related costs for this drug candidate compared with the corresponding periods in 2023. 
 Depot injectable programs 
 Our research and development expenses for depot injectable programs were zero and 2,000 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to zero and 319,000 for the corresponding periods in 2023. The decreases in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to lower employee-related costs and lower outside expenses for these programs compared with the corresponding periods in 2023. 
 Other DURECT research programs 
 Our research and development expenses for all other programs were 15,000 and 113,000 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 808,000 and 2.3 million for the corresponding periods in 2023. The decreases in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to lower employee-related costs and lower outside expenses associated with these programs compared with the corresponding periods in 2023. 
 Our research and development programs may span as many as ten years or more, and estimation of completion dates or costs to complete are highly speculative and subjective due to numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products, including significant and changing government regulation, uncertainties of future preclinical and clinical study results, uncertainties with our collaborators commitment to and progress in the programs and uncertainties associated with process development and manufacturing as well as sales and marketing. In addition, with respect to our development programs subject to third-party collaborations, the timing and expenditures to complete the programs are subject to the control of our collaborators. Therefore, we cannot reasonably estimate the timing and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the research and development programs. For additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1A., Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 28, 2024, and any additional risk factors that may be described herein or in our subsequent filings filed with the SEC. 
 Selling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses are primarily comprised of salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and other costs associated with finance, accounting, legal, business development, sales and marketing and other administrative personnel, overhead and facility costs, and other general and administrative costs. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses were 3.2 million and 9.3 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 3.8 million and 11.7 million for the corresponding periods in 2023. The decreases in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to lower employee expenses, lower audit related expenses and lower patent expenses compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. Stock-based compensation expense recognized related to selling, general and administrative personnel was 279,000 and 838,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 351,000 and 1.0 million for the corresponding periods in 2023. 
 We had 21 selling, general and administrative employees as of September 30, 2024 compared with 25 as of September 30, 2023. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses in the near future to be comparable to the third quarter of 2024. 
 27 

Other income (expense). Other expense was 318,000 and 2.5 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to other income of 6.5 million and 4.4 million for the corresponding periods in 2023. 
 Interest and other income 
 Interest and other income was 163,000 and 711,000 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 653,000 and 1.7 million for the corresponding periods in 2023. The decreases in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to lower balances in our cash, cash equivalents and investments compared with the corresponding periods in 2023. 
 Interest and other expenses 
 Interest and other expenses were 364,000 and 1.3 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 700,000 and 2.2 million for the corresponding periods in 2023. The decreases in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to lower principal balances on our term loan compared with the corresponding periods in 2023. 
 Change in fair value of warrant liabilities 
 The change in fair value of warrant liabilities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was comprised of a non-cash loss of 117,000 for the common warrants issued in February 2023 and July 2023. The change in fair value of warrant liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was comprised of a non-cash loss of 1.9 million for the common warrants issued in February 2023 and July 2023. 
 The change in fair value of warrant liabilities during the three months ended September 30, 2023 was comprised of a non-cash gain of 7.0 million for the liability-classified warrants issued in February 2023 and July 2023 as well as the alternative cashless exercise of common warrants issued in February 2023. The change in fair value of warrant liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 comprised of a non-cash gain of 8.6 million for the liability-classified warrants issued in February 2023 and July 2023 as well as the alternative cashless exercise of common warrants issued in February 2023. 
 Issuance cost for warrants 
 The issuance cost for warrants was zero in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The issuance cost for warrants was 427,000 and 1.6 million in the three and nine months ended September 30 2023, respectively. 
 Loss on issuance of warrants 
 Loss on issuance of warrants was zero in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Loss on issuance of warrants was zero and 2.0 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We had cash, cash equivalents and investments totaling 10.5 million at September 30, 2024 compared to cash, cash equivalents, and investments of 29.8 million at December 31, 2023. These balances include 150,000 of interest-bearing marketable securities classified as restricted investments on our balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The decrease in cash, cash equivalents and investments was primarily due to cash used in ongoing operating activities and principal and interest payments on the term loan, partially offset by net proceeds of 648,000 from the sale of our common stock in the open market pursuant to the 2021 Sales Agreement (as described below) and payments received from collaboration partners and customers. For more information on our registered direct offerings that took place in February and July 2023, see Note 8 Stockholders Equity Registered Direct Offerings to our unaudited condensed financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations. We select investments that maximize interest income to the extent possible given these two constraints. We satisfy liquidity requirements by investing excess cash in securities with different maturities to match projected cash needs and limit concentration of credit risk by diversifying our investments among a variety of high credit-quality issuers. 
 As discussed below, we do not have sufficient cash resources to fund our planned operations, existing debt and contractual commitments and planned capital expenditures. Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion as of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2023. Unless we secure funding from collaborations, additional equity or debt financing, of which there can be no assurance, we may not be able to continue operations. 
 Cash Flows 
 We used 13.6 million of cash in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 26.1 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The decrease in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to lower costs incurred to research and develop our product candidates and, to a lesser extent, from selling, general and administrative costs associated with our operations and product sales, partially offset by lower payments from our collaborators. The cash used in operations was primarily to 
 28 

fund operations as well as our working capital requirements. We anticipate that cash used in operating activities in the near future will be comparable to the third quarter of 2024. 
 We received 34,000 of cash from investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to using 132,000 of cash in investing activities for the corresponding period in 2023. The increase in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to an increase in net proceeds from maturities of available-for-sale securities and a decrease in purchases of available of available-for-sale securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the corresponding period in 2023. 
 We used 5.8 million of cash in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to receiving 21.7 million of cash from financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash received from financing activities was primarily due to no cash proceeds received from registered direct financings and higher principal payments on the term loan with Oxford Finance LLC ("Oxford Finance") during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the corresponding period in 2023. 
 Shelf Registration Statement 
 In July 2021, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC (the 2021 Registration Statement (File No. 333-258333), which upon being declared effective in August 2021, allowed us to offer up to 250.0 million of securities from time to time in one or more public offerings, inclusive of up to 75.0 million of shares of our common stock which we could sell, subject to certain limitations, pursuant to the 2021 Sales Agreement. The 2021 Registration Statement expired on August 16, 2024. 
 On August 14, 2024, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC (the 2024 Registration Statement (File No. 333-281550), which upon being declared effective on August 23, 2024, allowed us to offer up to 250.0 million of securities from time to time in one or more public offerings. In addition, due to the SEC s baby shelf rules, which prohibit companies with a public float of less than 75 million from issuing securities under a shelf registration statement in excess of one-third of such company s public float in a 12-month period, we are currently only able to issue a limited number of shares under our 2024 Registration Statement, which aggregate to no more than one-third of our public float. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we raised net proceeds (net of commissions) of approximately 648,000 from the sale of our common stock in the open market under the 2021 Sales Agreement. 
 As of November 11, 2024, we had up to 250.0 million of our securities available for sale under the 2024 Registration Statement. However, due to the SEC s baby shelf rules discussed above, only up to approximately 15.8 million of our securities are available for sale under the 2024 Registration Statement. 
 Any material sales in the public market of our common stock, under the 2024 Registration Statement, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock. 
 Term Loan 
 In July 2016, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (as amended, the "Loan Agreement") with Oxford Finance, pursuant to which Oxford Finance provided a 20.0 million secured single-draw term loan to us with an initial maturity date of August 1, 2020. The term loan was fully drawn at close and the proceeds were used for working capital and general business requirements. Following five amendments, we made interest only payments under the amended Loan Agreement until June 1, 2023, and are making consecutive monthly payments of principal and interest in arrears to be paid through September 1, 2025, the final maturity date of the term loan. The Loan Agreement provides for a floating interest rate (7.95 initially and 12.61 as of September 30, 2024) based on an index rate plus a spread and an additional payment equal to 10 of the principal amount of the term loan, which is due when the term loan becomes due or upon the prepayment of the facility. If we elect to prepay the term loan, there is also a prepayment fee between 0.75 and 2.5 of the principal amount of the term loan depending on the timing of prepayment. Our debt repayment obligations under the Loan Agreement may prove a burden to the Company as they become due, particularly following the expiration of the interest-only period. 
 The term loan is secured by substantially all of our assets, except that the collateral does not include any intellectual property (including licensing, collaboration and similar agreements relating thereto), and certain other excluded assets. The Loan Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants by us, which covenants limit our ability to convey, sell, lease, transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of certain assets; engage in any business other than the businesses currently engaged in by us or reasonably related thereto; liquidate or dissolve; make certain management changes; undergo certain change of control events; create, incur, assume, or be liable with respect to certain indebtedness; grant certain liens; pay dividends and make certain other restricted payments; make certain investments; and make payments on any subordinated debt. 
 29 

The Loan Agreement also contains customary indemnification obligations and customary events of default, including, among other things, our failure to fulfill certain obligations under the 2016 Loan Agreement and the occurrence of a material adverse change which is defined as a material adverse change in our business, operations, or condition (financial or otherwise), a material impairment of the prospect of repayment of any portion of the term loan, or a material impairment in the perfection or priority of lender s lien in the collateral or in the value of such collateral. In the event of default by us under the 2016 Loan Agreement, the lender would be entitled to exercise its remedies thereunder, including the right to accelerate the debt, upon which we may be required to repay all amounts then outstanding under the Loan Agreement. As a result, the term loan was reclassified to current liabilities from non-current liabilities on our balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 due to recurring losses, liquidity concerns and a subjective acceleration clause in the Loan Agreement. 
 Going Concern 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments totaling 10.5 million compared to cash, cash equivalents, and investments of 29.8 million at December 31, 2023. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we raised net proceeds (net of commissions) of approximately 648,000 from the sale of our common stock in the open market under the 2021 Sales Agreement. 
 In accordance with ASU No. 2014-15 Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (subtopic 205-40), our management evaluates whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. Based on our evaluation, substantial doubt exists regarding our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance of our financial statements. 
 Presently, we do not have sufficient cash resources to fund our planned operations, existing debt and contractual commitments and planned capital expenditures through at least the next 12 months from issuance of these financial statements. We may consume available resources more rapidly than currently anticipated, resulting in the need for additional funding. We expect to incur continuing losses and negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future. 
 We may decide to raise additional capital through a variety of sources in the short-term and in the long-term, including but not limited to: 
 the public equity markets; 

private equity financings; 

collaborative arrangements; 

asset sales; and/or 

public or private debt. 

There can be no assurance that we will enter into additional collaborative agreements or maintain existing collaborative agreements, will earn collaborative revenues or that additional capital will be available on favorable terms to the Company, if at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to significantly reduce or re-focus our operations or to obtain funds through arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our products, technologies or potential markets, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. To the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities would result in ownership dilution to our existing stockholders (assuming convertible debt securities were converted into shares). These factors raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Our inability to obtain required funding in the near future or our inability to obtain funding on favorable terms will have a material adverse effect on our operations and strategic development plan for future growth. If we cannot successfully raise additional capital and implement our strategic development plan, our liquidity, financial condition and business prospects will be materially and adversely affected, and we may have to cease operations. 
 As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our financial statements as of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2023. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes in our commercial commitments and contractual obligations as compared with the information presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 28, 2024. 
 Human Capital 
 As of November 11, 2024, we had 45 employees, including 17 in research and development, 8 in manufacturing and 20 in selling, general and administrative.

Item 3.	Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures about Market Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, our exposure to market risk has not changed materially since December 31, 2023. For more information on financial market risks related to changes in interest rates, reference is made to Part II, Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 28, 2024. 
 Item 4.	Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures: The Company s principal executive and principal financial officers reviewed and evaluated the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective at ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting: There were no significant changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) during the Company s most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceed ings 
 We are not a party to any material legal proceedings. 
 Item 1A. Risk F actors. 
 You should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A., Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 28, 2024, which could materially affect our business, financial position, or future results of operations. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial position, or future results of operations. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. The risk factor set forth below supplements and updates the risk factors previously disclosed and should be read together with the risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and with any risk factors we may include in subsequent filings with the SEC. 
 We will require and may have difficulty or be unsuccessful in raising needed capital in the future to continue to operate as a going concern 
 Our business currently does not generate sufficient revenues to meet our capital requirements and we do not expect that it will do so in the near future. We have expended and will continue to expend substantial funds to conduct the research, development, manufacturing and clinical testing of larsucosterol. 
 Presently, we do not have sufficient cash resources to meet our plans for the next twelve months from the issuance of the financial statements included herein. Our recurring losses from operations, negative cash flows and need for additional capital raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our financial statements as of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2023. We will require additional financing to fund our operations or we will have to significantly curtail or discontinue our operations to conserve our capital resources. Additional funds may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, and such availability will depend on a number of factors, some of which are outside of our control, including general capital markets conditions and investors view of our prospects and valuation. In addition, our ability to raise capital in the public capital markets may be limited by, among other things, SEC rules and regulations impacting the eligibility of smaller companies to use Form S-3 for primary offerings of securities. Based on our public float, as of the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we are only permitted to utilize the shelf registration statement subject to Instruction I.B.6. to Form S-3, which is referred to as the baby shelf rule. For so long as our public float is less than 75 million, we may not sell more than the equivalent of one-third of our public float during any 12 consecutive months pursuant to the baby shelf rules. Although alternative public and private transaction structures may be available, these may require additional time and cost, may impose operational restrictions on us, and may not be available on attractive terms. Further, investors perception of our ability to continue as a going concern may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing, or necessitate that we obtain financing on terms that are more favorable to investors, and could result in the loss of confidence by investors, suppliers and employees. Our continued operations are contingent on our ability to raise additional capital or license or otherwise monetize our assets. If we do not acquire sufficient additional funding or alternative sources of capital to meet our working capital needs, we will have to substantially curtail or discontinue our operations, resulting in delays in the development of larsucosterol and in generating revenue. 
 Our actual capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 
 continued progress and cost of our research and development programs; 

progress with clinical trials, including a Phase 3 clinical trial for larsucosterol in alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH); 

the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals, if any; 

costs involved in establishing manufacturing capabilities for pre-clinical, non-clinical, clinical and commercial quantities of our product candidates; 

success in entering into collaboration agreements and achieving milestones under such agreements; 

regulatory actions with respect to our products and product candidates; 

costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing intellectual property rights; 

costs of developing sales, marketing and distribution channels and our ability and that of our collaborators to sell our products, products we have a financial interest in and, eventually, product candidates; 

competing technological and market developments; 

market acceptance of our products, products we have a financial interest in and, eventually, product candidates; 

32 

any failure to comply with the covenants in our debt instruments that results in acceleration of repayment obligations; 

costs for recruiting and retaining employees and consultants; and 

unexpected legal, accounting and other costs and liabilities related to our business. 

We may consume available resources more rapidly than currently anticipated, resulting in the need for additional funding. For example, we do not currently have sufficient capital resources to conduct a Phase 3 trial of larsucosterol. We may seek to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings, convertible debt financings, collaborative arrangements with corporate collaborators or other sources, which, in each case, may be dilutive to existing stockholders and may cause the price of our common stock to decline. In addition, in the event that additional funds are obtained through arrangements with collaborators or other sources, we may have to relinquish rights to some of our technologies, products or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves. 
 We do not control the commercialization of PERSERIS or Methydur 
 We have relied on Indivior for the commercialization of PERSERIS. In July 2024, Indivior announced that they were discontinuing sales and marketing activities related to PERSERIS. Accordingly, we expect payments based on sales of PERSERIS to decline in the future. Further, we rely on Orient Pharma for the commercialization of Methydur. If Orient Pharma does not successfully grow Methydur sales, the royalty payments we receive under our agreement with them will be limited. The sales of each of these products may be negatively impacted by challenging macroeconomic conditions. 
 Our ability to obtain revenues from the commercialization of POSIMIR is uncertain. 
 We have relied on Innocoll to commercialize POSIMIR in the United States pursuant to the Innocoll Agreement, which entitled us to tiered, low double-digit to mid-teen royalties on net product sales of POSIMIR in the United States, and milestone payments of up to 122.0 million in the aggregate, depending on the achievement of certain regulatory, commercial, and intellectual property milestones with respect to POSIMIR. The current approved labeling for POSIMIR is limited, and Innocoll has been responsible for completing post-marketing non-clinical studies and any additional studies required by the FDA, as well as for manufacturing POSIMIR. On November 8, 2024, we received notice that Innocoll is terminating the Innocoll Agreement, effective May 6, 2025. Innocoll has committed to transfer all data and know-how related to POSIMIR to us, and we are evaluating next steps with respect to the commercialization of POSIMIR. There can be no assurance that we will be able to generate revenues from the commercialization of POSIMIR. 
 For certain of our product candidates, we depend to a large extent on third-party collaborators, and we have limited or no control over their development, sales, distribution and disclosure for those product candidates 
 Our performance for certain of our product candidates depends to a large extent on the ability of our third-party collaborators to successfully develop and obtain regulatory approvals. We have entered into agreements with Indivior and Orient Pharma under which we granted such third parties the right to develop, apply for regulatory approval for, market, promote or distribute certain products or product candidates, subject to payments to us in the form of product royalties, earn-out and other payments. We have limited or no control over the expertise or resources that any collaborator may devote to the development, clinical trial strategy, regulatory approval, marketing or sale of these product candidates, or the timing of their activities. Any of our present or future collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected. These collaborators may breach or terminate their agreement with us or otherwise fail to conduct their collaborative activities successfully and in a timely manner. Enforcing any of these agreements in the event of a breach by the other party could require the expenditure of significant resources and consume a significant amount of management time and attention. Our collaborators may also conduct their activities in a manner that is different from the manner we would recommend or would have chosen had we been developing such product candidates ourselves. Further, our collaborators may elect not to develop or commercialize product candidates arising out of our collaborative arrangements or not devote sufficient resources to the development, clinical trials, regulatory approval, manufacture, marketing or sale of these product candidates. If any of these events occur, we may not recognize revenue from the commercialization of our product candidates based on such collaborations. In addition, these third parties may have similar or competitive products to the ones which are the subject of their collaborations with us, or relationships with our competitors, which may reduce their interest in developing or selling our products or product candidates. We may not be able to control public disclosures made by some of our third-party collaborators, which could negatively impact our stock price. 
 Cancellation of third-party collaborations may adversely affect potential economic benefits 
 Third-party collaboration agreements typically allow the third party to terminate the agreement (or a specific program within an agreement) at will by providing notice. Termination can result from failure of the collaboration to achieve anticipated milestones, from changes in strategy of the other party or for other reasons. In these cases, the product rights typically revert to us or certain rights of the partner to use our proprietary technology are terminated. If there have been payments under such agreements that are being recognized over time, termination of such agreements (or programs) can lead to a near-term increase in our reported revenues resulting from the immediate recognition of the balance of such payments. Termination deprives us of potential future economic benefits under such agreements, and may make it more difficult, unattractive or impossible to enter into agreements with other third parties for use of the assets and/or technologies that were subject to the terminated agreement. For example, on November 8, 2024, Innocoll notified us of their termination of the Innocoll Agreement, effective as of May 6, 2025, pursuant to which we could have received royalties and milestone payments beyond May 6, 2025.

Item 5. Other Information 
 The information set forth below Item 1.02. Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement of Part II, Item 5 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is provided in lieu of filing such information on a Current Report on Form 8-K under Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement. 
 Item 1.02.	Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement 
 On November 8, 2024, we received a notice of termination of the Innocoll Agreement, dated December 21, 2021, as amended on September 19, 2022, by and between the Company and Innocoll. Innocoll terminated the Innocoll Agreement for convenience pursuant to Section 10.2(a) of the Innocoll Agreement, effective May 6, 2025 (the Termination Date ). Pursuant to the Innocoll Agreement, the Company granted Innocoll an exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable right and license to develop, manufacture and commercialize in the United States, POSIMIR , the Company s FDA-approved post-surgical pain product, with respect to all uses and applications in humans. For further description of the Innocoll Agreement, see Note 2 Strategic Agreements Agreement with Innocoll to our unaudited condensed financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Prior to the Termination Date, Innocoll will work with the Company to fulfill the respective rights and obligations of each party in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Innocoll Agreement, including the transfer of data and know-how related to POSIMIR. As a result of the termination of the Innocoll Agreement, the Company will not be entitled to receive any further royalties or milestone payments due after the Termination Date unless such royalties or milestone payments were accrued prior to the Termination Date. The Company is evaluating next steps with respect to the commercialization of POSIMIR. 
 Insider Adoption or Termination of Trading Arrangements 
 During the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, none of our directors or officers informed us of the or of a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as those terms are defined in Regulation S-K, Item 408.
