The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation under a contract with an advertiser. The transaction price is allocated to performance obligations based on executed contracts, which represent relative standalone selling prices. Payment is generally due within 30 days, although certain advertisers are required to pay in advance. Revenues are reported at the amount the Company expects to be entitled to receive under the contract. The Company has elected to use the practical expedient to expense sales commissions as incurred. Payments received from advertisers before the performance obligation is satisfied are recorded as deferred revenue in the balance sheets. Substantially all deferred revenue is recognized within 12 months of the payment date. 

Audio revenue includes revenue from the sale or trade of aired commercial spots to advertisers directly or through national, regional or local advertising agencies. Each commercial spot is considered a performance obligation. Revenue is recognized when the commercial spots have aired. Trade sales are recorded at the estimated fair value of the goods or services received. If commercial spots are aired before the goods or services are received, then a trade sales receivable is recorded. If goods or services are received before the commercial spots are aired, then a trade sales payable is recorded. Other revenue includes revenue from concerts, promotional events, talent fees and other miscellaneous items. Such revenue is generally recognized when the concert, promotional event, or talent services are completed.

Digital revenue includes revenue from the sale of streamed commercial spots, station-owned assets and third-party products. Each streamed commercial spot, station-owned asset and third-party product is considered a performance obligation. Revenue is recognized when the commercial spots have streamed. Station-owned assets are generally scheduled over a period of time and revenue is recognized over time as the digital items are used for advertising content, except for streamed commercial spots. Third-party products are generally scheduled over a period of time with an impression target each month. Revenue from the sale of third-party products is recognized over time as the digital items are used for advertising content and impression targets are met each month.

 Reverse Stock Split 
 On September 23, 2024, the Company effected a 1-for-20 reverse stock split of the Company s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock (the Reverse Stock Split ). As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every 20 shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding were automatically converted into one share of Class A Common Stock, and every 20 shares of the Company s Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding were automatically converted into one share of Class B Common Stock. No fractional shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Holders of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock received cash in lieu of fractional shares. The Reverse Stock Split had no effect on the par value of the Company s Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, which remained 0.001 per share, and had no effect on the number of authorized shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock. Following the Reverse Stock Split, the Class A Common Stock continued to be traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol BBGI on a split-adjusted basis beginning on September 24, 2024. 
 
 In addition, consistent with the terms of the Company's 2007 Equity Incentive Award Plan (the "2007 Plan") and outstanding awards granted under the 2007 Plan, the total number of shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise, vesting or settlement of such awards and the total number of shares of Class A Common Stock remaining available for future awards under the 2007 Plan, as well as any share-based limits in the 2007 Plan, were proportionately reduced, and any fractional shares resulting therefrom were rounded down to the nearest whole share. Furthermore, the exercise prices of any outstanding options under the 2007 Plan were proportionately increased based on the Reverse Stock Split ratio, and the resulting exercise prices were rounded up to the nearest whole cent. All share and share-related information presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements, for all periods presented, has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split.

 Financial Statement Presentation 
 The following discussion provides a brief description of certain key items that appear in our financial statements and general factors that impact these items. 
 Net Revenue. Our net revenue is primarily derived from the sale of commercial spots to advertisers directly or through national, regional or local advertising agencies. Revenues are reported at the amount we expect to be entitled to receive under the contract. Local revenue generally consists of commercial advertising sales, digital advertising sales and other sales to advertisers in a station s local market, either directly to the advertiser or through the advertiser s agency. National revenue generally consists of commercial 
 16 

advertising sales through advertiser agencies. National advertiser agencies generally purchase advertising for multiple markets. National sales are generally facilitated by our national representation firm, which serves as our agent in these transactions. 
 Our net revenue is generally determined by the advertising rates that we are able to charge and the number of advertisements that we can broadcast without jeopardizing listener levels. Advertising rates are primarily based on the following factors: 
 a station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers as measured principally by periodic reports issued by Nielsen Audio; 

the number of stations, as well as other forms of media, in the market competing for the attention of the same demographic groups; 

the supply of, and demand for, radio advertising time; and 

the size of the market. 

Our net revenue is affected by general economic conditions, competition and our ability to improve operations at our radio market clusters. Seasonal revenue fluctuations are also common in the radio broadcasting industry and are primarily due to variations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers. Our revenues typically are lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year. In addition, our revenues tend to fluctuate between years, consistent with, among other things, increased advertising expenditures in even-numbered years by political candidates, political parties and special interest groups. This political spending typically is heaviest during the fourth quarter of such years. 
 We use trade sales agreements to reduce cash paid for operating costs and expenses by exchanging advertising airtime for goods or services; however, we endeavor to minimize trade revenue in order to maximize cash revenue from our available airtime. 
 We also continue to invest in digital support services to develop and promote our station websites, applications, and other distribution platforms. We derive revenue from our websites through the sale of advertiser promotions and advertising on our websites and the sale of advertising airtime during audio streaming of our stations over the internet. We also generate revenue from selling third-party digital products and services. 
 Operating Expenses. Our operating expenses consist primarily of programming, engineering, sales, advertising and promotion, and general and administrative expenses incurred at our stations. We strive to control our operating expenses by centralizing certain functions at our corporate offices and consolidating certain functions in each of our market clusters. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: 
 it involves a significant level of estimation uncertainty; and 

changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. 

Our critical accounting estimates are described in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no additional material changes to our critical accounting estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Net Revenue. Net revenue decreased 1.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Audio revenue decreased 1.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in local agency revenue and the disposition of WJBR-FM in Wilmington, DE in October 2023 partially offset by an increase in political advertising for the 2024 elections. Digital revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was comparable to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Other revenue decreased 0.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to the termination of our esports operations in December 2023. 
 Operating Expenses. Operating expenses decreased 0.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Audio operating expenses increased 0.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in compensation expense related to workforce reductions, partially offset by the disposition of WJBR-FM in Wilmington, DE in October 2023. Digital operating expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 were comparable to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Other operating expenses decreased 1.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to the termination of our esports operations in December 2023. 
 Corporate Expenses. Corporate expenses decreased 0.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in digital expenses allocated to operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in contract services. 
 FCC Licenses Impairment Losses. Due to an increase in interest rates in the U.S. economy and a decrease in projected revenues, we tested our FCC licenses for impairment during the third quarter of 2023. As a result of the quantitative impairment tests, we recorded impairment losses of 78.2 million related to the FCC licenses in each of our market clusters. The impairment losses were primarily due to an increase in the discount rate due to certain risks associated with the U.S. economy and a decrease in the projected revenues in each market cluster used in the discounted cash flow analyses to estimate the fair value of FCC licenses. 
 18 

Goodwill Impairment Losses. Due to an increase in interest rates in the U.S. economy and a decrease in projected revenues, we tested our goodwill for impairment during the third quarter of 2023. As a result of the quantitative impairment test, we recorded an impairment loss of 10.6 million related to the goodwill in our Philadelphia, PA market cluster. The impairment loss was primarily due to an increase in the discount rate due to certain risks associated with the U.S. economy and a decrease in the projected revenues used in the discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value of the goodwill. 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased 0.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to repurchases of the Existing Notes throughout 2023. 
 Income Tax Benefit. Our effective tax rate was approximately (26) and (27) for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. These rates differ from the federal statutory rate of 21 due to the effect of state income taxes and certain expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes. 
 Net Loss. Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.6 million compared to a net loss of 67.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of the factors described above. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023

Audio operating expenses decreased 0.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the disposition of WJBR-FM in Wilmington, DE in October 2023, partially offset by an increase in compensation expense related to workforce reductions. Digital operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were comparable to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Other operating expenses decreased 3.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to the termination of our esports operations in December 2023. 
 Corporate Expenses. Corporate expenses decreased 0.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in digital expenses allocated to operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in compensation and contract services. 
 FCC Licenses Impairment Losses. Due to an increase in interest rates in the U.S. economy and a decrease in projected revenues, we tested our FCC licenses for impairment during the third quarter of 2023. As a result of the quantitative impairment tests, we recorded impairment losses of 78.2 million related to the FCC licenses in each of our market clusters. The impairment losses were primarily due to an increase in the discount rate due to certain risks associated with the U.S. economy and a decrease in the projected revenues in each market cluster used in the discounted cash flow analyses to estimate the fair value of FCC licenses. On August 11, 2023, we entered into an agreement to sell substantially all of the assets used in the operations of WJBR-FM in Wilmington, DE to a third party for 5.0 million in cash. As a result of entering the agreement, we recorded an impairment loss of 10.0 million related to the FCC license during the second quarter of 2023. 
 Goodwill Impairment Losses. Due to an increase in interest rates in the U.S. economy and a decrease in projected revenues, we tested our goodwill for impairment during the third quarter of 2023. As a result of the quantitative impairment test we recorded an impairment loss of 10.6 million related to the goodwill in our Philadelphia, PA market cluster. The impairment loss was primarily due to an increase in the discount rate due to certain risks associated with the U.S. economy and a decrease in the projected revenues used in the discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value of the goodwill. 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased 2.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to repurchases of the Existing Notes throughout 2023. 
 Gain on Sale of Investment. On March 8, 2024, we received 6.0 million related to the sale of an investment in Broadcast Music, Inc. and recorded a gain of 6.0 million. 
 Income Tax Benefit. Our effective tax rate was approximately (24) and (32) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. These rates differ from the federal statutory rate of 21 due to the effect of state income taxes and certain expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes. 
 Net Loss. Net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.8 million compared to a net loss of 81.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of the factors described above. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview. Our primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow and cash on hand. Our primary liquidity needs have been, and for the next 12 months and thereafter are expected to continue to be, for working capital, debt service, and other general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures and station acquisitions. Historically, our capital expenditures have not been significant. In addition to property and equipment associated with station acquisitions, our capital expenditures have generally been, and are expected to continue to be, related to the maintenance of our office and studio space, the maintenance of our towers and equipment, and digital products and information technology. We have also purchased or constructed office and studio space in some of our markets to facilitate the consolidation of our operations. 
 20 

Our board of directors has suspended future quarterly dividend payments until it is determined that resumption of dividend payments is in the best interest of the Company s stockholders. In addition, as discussed in Secured Notes below, the New Notes Indenture and Exchange Notes Indenture limit our ability to pay dividends. 
 Secured Notes. On February 2, 2021, we issued 300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.625 senior secured notes due on February 1, 2026 (the Existing Notes under an indenture dated February 2, 2021 (the Existing Notes Indenture ). Interest on the Existing Notes accrues at the rate of 8.625 per annum and is payable semiannually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year. The Existing Notes are secured on a first-lien priority basis by substantially all assets of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries and are guaranteed jointly and severally by the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. 
 In the second quarter of 2023, we repurchased 3.0 million principal amount of the Existing Notes for a price equal to 66 of the principal amount and recorded a gain of 1.0 million as a result of the repurchase. 
 On October 8, 2024 (the Settlement Date ), Beasley Mezzanine Holdings, LLC (the Issuer ), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and certain other of the Company s subsidiaries, completed: (i) the exchange (the Exchange Offer of 194.7 million aggregate principal amount of the Existing Notes (representing 72.9 of the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Existing Notes) for (a) 184.9 million aggregate principal amount of the Issuer s newly issued 9.200 Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due August 1, 2028 (the Exchange Notes at an exchange ratio of 95.0 of the aggregate principal amount of the Existing Notes tendered for exchange, (b) 179,384 shares of Class A Common Stock of the Company, based upon pro rata ownership of the Exchange Notes issued by the Issuer, and (c) certain cash payments aggregating approximately 1.0 million, (ii) the purchase of 68.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Existing Notes at a purchase price of 62.5 plus accrued and unpaid interest (such offer, the Tender Offer and (iii) the issuance by the Issuer of 30.9 million aggregate principal amount of 11.000 Senior Secured First Lien notes due 2028 (the New Notes, and such offering, the New Notes Offer to holders of Existing Notes or their designees who participated in the Exchange Offer, including to certain backstop commitment parties who committed to purchase the New Notes not otherwise subscribed for. The Company received requisite consents from holders of Existing Notes to (a) adopt certain amendments (the Proposed Amendments to the Existing Notes Indenture and the related security documents and (b) execute a supplemental indenture (the Supplemental Indenture to the Existing Notes Indenture and each relevant ancillary document effecting the Proposed Amendments. The Company used the proceeds from the New Notes Offer of 30.0 million to fund, in part, the purchase of Existing Notes tendered in the Tender Offer. 
 On the Settlement Date, the Issuer entered into (i) a new indenture (the New Notes Indenture governing its New Notes, which are fully and unconditionally secured by substantially all of the assets, other than certain excluded property, of the Issuer and the guarantors (the Collateral on a senior secured first-priority lien basis, subject to certain exceptions, limitations and permitted liens and (ii) a new indenture (the Exchange Notes Indenture governing its Exchange Notes, which are fully and unconditionally secured by liens on the Collateral on a senior secured second-priority lien basis, subject to certain exceptions, limitations and permitted liens, in each case with the guarantors thereto and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee and collateral agent, with respect to both the Exchange Notes Indenture and New Notes Indenture. On the Settlement Date, the Issuer also entered into the Supplemental Indenture with Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee and collateral agent, supplementing the Existing Notes Indenture. The New Notes Indenture and the Exchange Notes Indenture contain restrictive covenants that limit the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, guarantee indebtedness or issue disqualified stock or, in the case of such subsidiaries, preferred stock; pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments; make certain investments or acquisitions; sell, transfer or otherwise convey certain assets; create liens; enter into agreements restricting certain subsidiaries ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany transfers; consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; enter into transactions with affiliates; prepay certain kinds of indebtedness; and issue or sell stock of our subsidiaries. 
 On the Settlement Date, the Company entered into a common stock purchase agreement for the issuance and sale of 56,864 shares of Class A Common Stock of the Company to Beasley Family Towers, LLC at an offering price of approximately 12.31 per share, for gross proceeds of 700,000. The Company used the net proceeds to fund a portion of the cash payment made to the exchanging holders in the Exchange Offer and for other corporate purposes. 
 From time to time, we repurchase sufficient shares of our Class A Common Stock to fund withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of restricted stock units. We paid approximately 90,000 to repurchase 6,684 shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. From time to time, we may seek to repurchase, redeem or otherwise retire our Existing Notes through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or otherwise. Such repurchases, redemptions or other transactions, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. 
 21 

We expect to provide for future liquidity needs through one or a combination of the following sources of liquidity: 
 internally generated cash flow; 

additional borrowings or notes offerings, to the extent permitted under the Existing Notes Indenture, New Notes Indenture and Exchange Notes Indenture; and 

additional equity offerings. 

We believe we will have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to permit us to provide for our liquidity requirements and meet our financial obligations for the next 12 months and thereafter. However, poor financial results or unanticipated expenses could give rise to default under the Existing Notes, additional debt servicing requirements or other additional financing or liquidity requirements sooner than we expect, and we may not secure financing when needed or on acceptable terms. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. 
 Cash Flows . The following summary table presents a comparison of our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024 with respect to certain of our key measures affecting our liquidity. The changes set forth in the table are discussed in greater detail below. This section should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report.
