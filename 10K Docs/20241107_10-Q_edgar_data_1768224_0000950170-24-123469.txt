 million and million, respectively. The Company s activities since inception have consisted principally of research and development activities, general and administrative activities, and raising capital. The Company s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including failing to secure additional funding before the Company achieves sustainable revenues and profit from operations. From the Company s inception through September 30, 2024, the Company has funded its operations principally with the proceeds from revenues earned through collaboration agreements, the sale of capital stock, expense reimbursements from government contracts and proceeds from long-term debt. At September 30, 2024, the Company s balance of cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, was million. Management believes that it has sufficient working capital on hand to fund operations through at least the next twelve months from the date these condensed consolidated financial statements were available to be issued. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in securing additional funding, that the Company s projections of its future working capital needs will prove accurate, or that any additional funding would be sufficient to continue operations in future years.

million. Restricted cash also includes cash required to be set aside as security for lease payments and to maintain a letter of credit for the benefit of the landlord for the Company s offices. At September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company had restricted cash of million and million, respectively, in conjunction with property leases in San Diego, California, and such restriction is expected to be removed at the end of the lease term. At September 30, 2023, non-current restricted cash also includes million related to the Wells Fargo Loan (Note 5). The following table provides a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of cash flows as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 :

million upfront payment and is eligible to receive over billion in development milestones if all products are registered in the licensed fields and entitled to potentially receive up to billion in commercial milestones based on net sale of vaccines in the various fields. In addition, the Company is eligible to receive a net profit share for COVID-19 vaccine products and up to low double-digit royalties for vaccines against flu, pandemic preparedness and three other respiratory pathogens. During the third quarter of 2024, upon the first commercial sale of KOSTAIVE following regulatory approval in Japan, the Company achieved a million development milestone related to the CSL Collaboration Agreement which was included in accounts receivable as of September 30, 2024. In evaluating the CSL Collaboration Agreement in accordance with ASC 606, the Company concluded that CSL Seqirus is a customer. The Company identified all promised goods/services within the CSL Collaboration Agreement, and when combining certain promised goods/services, the Company concluded that there are five distinct performance obligations. The nature of the performance obligations consists of delivery of the vaccine license, research and development services for COVID and non-COVID vaccines and regulatory activities for COVID vaccines. For each performance obligation, the Company estimated the standalone selling price based on 1) in the case of the license, the fair value using costs to recreate plus margin method and 2) in the case of research and development services and regulatory activities, cost plus margin for estimated full-time equivalent FTE costs, direct costs including laboratory supplies, contractors, and other out-of-pocket expenses for research and development services and regulatory activities. As of September 30, 2024, the transaction price consisted of upfront consideration received and milestones achieved. Additional variable consideration was not included in the transaction price at September 30, 2024 because the Company could not conclude that it is probable that including the variable consideration will not result in a significant revenue reversal. The Company allocated the transaction price to the performance obligations in proportion to their standalone selling price. The vaccine license was recognized at the point in time it was transferred in 2022. The research and development and regulatory activities performance obligations are recognized over a period of time based on the percentage of services rendered using the input method, meaning actual costs incurred divided by total costs budgeted to satisfy the performance obligation. Any consideration related to sales-based royalties will be recognized when the amounts are probable of non-reversal, provided that the reported sales are reliably measurable and the Company has no remaining promised goods/services, as they are constrained and therefore have also been excluded from the transaction price. The revenue recognized in the third quarter of 2024 relates to the license delivered, milestones achieved and services performed through September 30, 2024. Total deferred revenue as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 for the CSL Collaboration Agreement was 40.3 million and million, respectively. During 2023, the Company also received an advance payment of million for the manufacturing and supply of ARCT-154 drug product. The advance payment was for specified manufacturing runs of ARCT-154 which include the drug substance utilized, as well as the reservation fees and related manufacturing requirements. The Company concluded that the promise to manufacture and supply ARCT-154 drug product is a customer option as part of the CSL Collaboration Agreement and is accounted for as a separate contract. The Company recognized million in revenue related to this customer option during the second quarter of 2024. amount related to this customer option remained in deferred revenue as of September 30, 2024. During 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to the CSL Collaboration Agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sponsor and conduct a Phase 1 clinical study in the influenza field. As part of the amendment, the Company received million from CSL Seqirus. The amendment also provides for up to million in additional payments which are achievable upon meeting certain clinical milestones relating to the Phase 1 clinical study in the influenza field. The Company previously concluded that the expansion of research and development support services under the CSL Collaboration Agreement represented an option that was not a material right. Therefore the Company concluded the promise to sponsor and conduct the Phase 1 clinical study is a separate contract and the sole performance obligation under the new arrangement. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024 , the Company recognized million related to the performance obligation and the remaining amount of million is included in deferred revenue.

million from CSL Seqirus for manufacturing activities related to COVID-19 vaccine product. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company received an additional advance payment of million from CSL Seqirus for manufacturing activities related to COVID-19 vaccine product. The Company concluded that the promise to perform manufacturing activities is a customer option as part of the CSL Collaboration Agreement and is accounted for as a separate contract. The Company recognized million in revenue related to this customer option during the third quarter of 2024 upon the transfer of vaccine product to CSL Seqirus. The remaining million is included in deferred revenue as of September 30, 2024 and will be recognized as revenue when the remaining vaccine product is transferred to CSL Seqirus. In March 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to the CSL Collaboration Agreement, pursuant to which the parties agreed to, among other things, adjust (i) the development plans for certain product candidates, (ii) various development milestones related to such product candidates, (iii) provisions of the CSL Collaboration Agreement related to specific royalty payments, (iii) provisions of the CSL Collaboration Agreement related to distributors, and (iv) proprietary payment calculations related to the foregoing. BARDA Grant In August 2022, the Company entered into a cost reimbursement contract (the BARDA Contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority ("BARDA"), a division of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for an award of up to million for the development of a pandemic influenza vaccine using the Company's STARR self-amplifying mRNA vaccine platform technology. The Company earns grant revenue for performing tasks under the agreement. The Company determined that the BARDA Contract is not in the scope of ASC 808 or ASC 606. Applying International Accounting Standards No. 20 ("IAS 20"), Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance, by analogy, the Company recognizes grant revenue from the reimbursement of direct out-of-pocket expenses, overhead allocations and fringe benefits for research costs associated with the grant. The costs associated with these reimbursements are reflected as a component of research and development expense in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). As of September 30, 2024, the remaining available funding net of revenue e arned was million.

months from the commencement date with a remaining lease term through March 2025. Monthly rental payments are due under the lease and there are escalating rent payments during the term of the lease. The Company is also responsible for its proportional share of operating expenses of the building and common areas. In conjunction with the new lease, the Company received free rent for and received a tenant improvement allowance of million. In March 2024, the Company negotiated with the lessor to extend the lease through March 2027. The Company entered into an irrevocable standby letter of credit with the landlord for a security deposit of million upon executing the lease which is included (along with additional funds required to secure the letter of credit) in the balance of non-current restricted cash. In February 2020, the Company entered into a second non-cancellable operating lease agreement for office space near its current headquarters. The lease extended for months from the commencement date and included a right to extend In January 2024, the Company vacated this office space with no intention of operating out of the location in the future. The Company was still engaged in the lease for the property and obligated to make the remaining lease payments through March 31, 2025, and therefore recorded an impairment loss in the amount of million during the three months ended March 31, 2024, as there was no future economic benefit from the lease. In July 2024, the Company terminated the existing lease agreement, in accordance with its terms, thereby ending their contractual obligation to pay for the premises. As a result, no lease liability remains as of September 30, 2024. In September 2021, the Company entered into a third non-cancellable lease agreement for office, research and development, engineering and laboratory space near its current headquarters, and such lease term commenced during the second quarter of 2022. The initial term of this lease extends from the date of possession, and When the lease term was determined for the operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, the extension option for the lease was not included. The lease has a monthly base rent ranging from million to million which escalates over the lease term. The Company received a free rent period of four months and also pays for various operating costs, including utilities and real property taxes. The Company entered into an irrevocable standby letter of credit with the landlord for a security deposit of million upon executing the lease which is included (along with additional funds required to secure the letter of credit) in the balance of non-current restricted cash. Operating lease right-of-use asset and liability on the condensed consolidated balance sheets represent the present value of remaining lease payments over the remaining lease terms. The Company does not allocate lease payments to non-lease components; therefore, payments for common-area-maintenance and administrative services are not included in the operating lease right-of-use asset and liability. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to calculate the present value of the lease payments, as the implicit rate in the lease is not readily determinable.

 Overview 
 We are a commercial messenger RNA medicines company focused on the development of infectious disease vaccines and opportunities within liver and respiratory rare diseases. In addition to our messenger RNA mRNA platform, our proprietary lipid nanoparticle LNP delivery system, LUNAR , may enable multiple nucleic acid medicines. Our proprietary self-amplifying mRNA technology (STARR technology) has been demonstrated to be longer lasting and broader response at lower dose levels than conventional mRNA. In 2023, our COVID-19 vaccine, ARCT-154 (also referred to as KOSTAIVE ), received marketing authorization approval in Japan, and in September 2024 KOSTAIVE became the world s first approved and commercially available self-amplifying RNA (sa-mRNA) vaccine. 
 We are leveraging our proprietary LUNAR platform and our nucleic acid technologies to develop and advance a pipeline of mRNA-based vaccines and therapeutics for infectious diseases and rare genetic disorders with significant unmet medical needs. We continue to expand this platform by adding new innovative delivery solutions that allow us to expand our discovery efforts. Our proprietary LUNAR technology is intended to address the major hurdles in RNA drug development, namely the effective and safe delivery of RNA therapeutics to disease-relevant target tissues. We believe the versatility of our platform to target multiple tissues, its compatibility with various nucleic acid therapeutics, and our expertise in developing scalable manufacturing processes can allow us to deliver on the next generation of nucleic acid medicines. 
 
 Business Updates 
 Vaccine Collaboration with CSL Seqirus 
 In November 2022, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement (as amended, the CSL Collaboration Agreement with Seqirus, Inc. CSL Seqirus ), a part of CSL Limited, and one of the world s leading influenza vaccine providers, for global exclusive rights to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize self-amplifying mRNA vaccines against COVID-19, influenza and three other respiratory infectious diseases and global non-exclusive rights to pandemic pathogens. The CSL Collaboration Agreement became effective on December 8, 2022. The collaboration combines CSL Seqirus established global vaccine commercial and manufacturing infrastructure with Arcturus manufacturing expertise and innovative STARR self-amplifying mRNA vaccine and LUNAR delivery platform technologies. Under the framework of our collaboration with CSL Seqirus, we continue the development of the COVID-19 vaccine to establish a differentiated platform and address routine recommendations for periodic vaccine composition updates in a timely manner. 
 In November 2023, KOSTAIVE , a self-amplifying messenger RNA (sa-mRNA) vaccine, received marketing authorization approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare for use as a primary immunization and booster in Japan for adults 18 years and older. The approval was based on positive clinical data from several ARCT-154 studies, including a 19,000-subject efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity study performed in Vietnam, as well as a Phase 3 booster study in Japan. 
 KOSTAIVE is the brand name approved in Japan for ARCT-154, which is the version of the sa-mRNA COVID vaccine encoding the ancestral strain of SARS-CoV-2, and for updated variant-specific versions of this vaccine. We may use KOSTAIVE or the specific internally generated name, such as ARCT-154, ARCT-2302 and ARCT-2303, to identify the vaccine. 
 16 

In September 2024, we announced that Japan s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) granted approval and authorization for an updated version of KOSTAIVE, targeted to protect against the JN.1 lineage of Omicron subvariants for adults 18 years of age and older. CSL s exclusive partner in Japan, Meiji Holdings Co., Ltd Meiji began distributing the updated vaccine in Japan in October 2024, marking the world s first commercially available sa-mRNA COVID-19 vaccine for adults 18 and older. The approval was based on manufacturing data demonstrating the quality and consistency of the vaccine product, non-clinical immunogenicity data against JN.1 lineage of Omicron subvariants of KOSTAIVE (JN.1), and clinical evidence supporting the safety and immunogenicity of KOSTAIVE (bivalent, BA.4/5 and ancestral strain). 
 The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is currently reviewing a marketing authorization application for ARCT-154. The review procedure started on August 17, 2023. 
 Earlier this year, CSL Seqirus partner Meiji Seika Pharma announced that it submitted a partial change application for an amendment to the manufacturing and marketing approval of KOSTAIVE to include manufacturing sites in Japan, including ARCALIS, Inc., Arcturus manufacturing joint venture in Japan. Meiji Seika Pharma will begin selling domestically produced KOSTAIVE this season. 
 
 Clinical Studies of KOSTAIVE (COVID-19 vaccine) 
 In connection with our collaboration with CSL Seqirus, we continue to collect data from the various ongoing studies described below. 
 Pivotal Phase 3 Non-Inferiority Study of KOSTAIVE (ARCT-154) in Japan 
 Meiji sponsored a randomized, multicenter, Phase 3, observer-blind, active-controlled comparative study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose of ARCT-154 and to evaluate the non-inferiority of ARCT-154 over COMIRNATY (Monovalent, Original strain). The study targeted 780 adult participants, with half in the ARCT-154 group and half in a comparator group, and completed enrollment with 828 participants in February 2023. The study met all primary and secondary immunogenicity endpoints, including a secondary pre-defined superiority assessment over COMIRNATY (Omicron BA.4/5 strain). Overall, the safety and immunogenicity results of the study support the favorable benefit/risk profile of the ARCT-154 vaccine when administered as a booster dose in adult individuals who previously received other mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. 
 On February 1, 2024, the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases published the article Persistence of immune responses of a self-amplifying RNA COVID-19 vaccine (ARCT154) versus BNT162b2 (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(24)00060-4/fulltext), with six-month follow-up results from this study. These additional data demonstrate the extended persistence of neutralizing antibodies after administration with ARCT-154 compared with conventional mRNA vaccine in the clinical setting, indicating longer-lasting immunity and implying a longer duration of protection by ARCT-154. 
 On September 30, 2024, we announced results from this study demonstrating that ARCT-154 maintained superior immunogenicity compared to the conventional mRNA vaccine (COMIRNATY) for up to 12 months against Wuhan-Hu-1, Omicron BA.4-5 and certain other COVID-19 variants, and at one-sixth the dose of the comparator (5 g vs 30 g, respectively). 
 In October 2024, Lancet Infectious Diseases published the follow-up article 12-month persistence of immune responses to self-amplifying mRNA COVID-19 vaccines: ARCT-154 versus BNT162b2 vaccine https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(24)00615-7/fulltext ), which confirmed a better neutralizing immune response against a panel of SARS-CoV-2 strains in pre-immunized Japanese adults boosted with ARCT-154 compared with the conventional mRNA vaccine, BNT162b2, which persisted up to 12 months post-vaccination, including in those age 50 years and older. 
 Phase 3 Study of Bivalent Version of COVID-19 KOSTAIVE in Japan 
 On September 29, 2023, Meiji initiated an additional Phase 3 clinical study with ARCT-2301, a bivalent version of KOSTAIVE (ancestral strain and Omicron BA.4/5) to further support immunogenicity and safety data for our self-amplifying mRNA platform, which may facilitate the timely release of future seasonal updates of our COVID-19 vaccine against evolving variants of concern. On March 19, 2024, Meiji announced that the bivalent vaccine met the primary study endpoint (non-inferiority). The study enrolled 930 healthy adults and individuals with comorbidities, who previously received three to five doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, including the last booster at least three months prior to recruitment. The study compares the investigational vaccine (ARCT-2301) and COMIRNATY (ancestral strain and BA.4/5) to evaluate safety and immunogenicity between observer-blind groups. Both the geometric mean titer (GMT) ratio and seroresponse rate (SRR) difference of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (Omicron BA.4/5 and Wuhan strains) met pre-specified non-inferiority and superiority criteria versus COMIRNATY. There were no causally-associated severe or serious adverse events with ARCT-2301. 
 In September 2024, we announced 6-month immunogenicity and safety results from this study. As with the monovalent vaccine, the bivalent sa-mRNA formulation demonstrates superior immunogenicity over the conventional bivalent mRNA vaccine 
 17 

COMIRNATY, a higher immune response persisting up to six months after a booster dose, and improved breadth, supporting the robustness of the sa-mRNA vaccine platform for future vaccine strain updates. The study results were presented at OPTIONS XII for the Control of Influenza conference in Brisbane, Australia, in September 2024. 
 Phase 3 Study in Southern Hemisphere of KOSTAIVE (Monovalent XBB1.5) 
 In March 2024, Arcturus and CSL Seqirus initiated a Phase 3 pivotal study with the ARCT-2303 candidate vaccine containing the XBB1.5 Omicron variant. The study aims to generate additional immunogenicity and safety data in multiple ethnicities to support regulatory filings in the US and globally. In addition, the study will assess the co-administration of the ARCT-2303 vaccine with the age-appropriate seasonal influenza vaccines. Overall, 1,499 young and older adults were recruited in the study in Australia, Costa Rica, Honduras and the Philippines. 
 The study results show that all four primary study objectives and key secondary study objectives were met. ARCT-2303 demonstrated superior immune response compared to ARCT-154 as measured by neutralizing antibodies against Omicron XBB.1.5 in terms of GMT ratio and SCR difference. Co-administration of ARCT-2303 and quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV; Flucelvax, CSL) in adults 18-64 years old showed noninferior immune response compared to standalone QIV. Co-administration of ARCT-2303 and QIV also showed noninferior immune response compared to standalone ARCT-2303. Co-administration of ARCT-2303 and adjuvanted QIV (Fluad, CSL) in adults 65 years of age and above showed similar results for co-administered and separately administered groups. The safety and reactogenicity of co-administered vaccines were comparable with standalone administration. No safety concerns were raised based on the study results. 
 
 Seasonal Flu Collaboration Program Updates 
 Our LUNAR-qsFLU (qs; quadrivalent seasonal) program, now exclusively licensed to CSL Seqirus, has the objective of producing a safe and effective seasonal influenza vaccine candidate with significant advantages over the traditional egg-based inactivated quadrivalent vaccine. Inaccurate predictions of circulating influenza strains as well as mutations due to adaptation in egg-grown vaccines can substantially reduce efficacy on a year-to-year basis. We believe the ability of mRNA platforms to nimbly adapt to new viral strains should help improve efficacy. In addition, we do not expect mRNA vaccines to face the challenge from mutations common to egg-grown vaccines. 
 LUNAR-qsFLU has been designed to take advantage of our expertise in both LUNAR lipid delivery systems and our STARR self-amplifying mRNA technology. This platform has been shown to deliver effective protection against COVID-19 and has been optimized to elicit robust immunogenicity with acceptable reactogenicity at a lower dose than conventional mRNA vaccines with the objective of creating a highly effective influenza vaccine for use in general and high-risk populations. Working with CSL Seqirus, we generated a comprehensive non-clinical data package to support the initiation of the Phase 1 clinical trial with a novel influenza sa-mRNA vaccine candidate. A Phase 1 dose-finding safety and immunogenicity study was initiated in January 2024 in Australia. 
 Pandemic Influenza Program 
 Our LUNAR-pandFLU program continues to progress under the award from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority BARDA that we obtained in 2022. The program includes all non-clinical, manufacturing, and regulatory support to advance a vaccine to protect against disease caused by H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza. A pre-IND meeting was 
 18 

granted, and a Written Response Only WRO was received for integration into future development plans. Nonclinical safety studies have been completed that will enable the Phase 1 clinical trial. 
 The IND application was submitted on October 9, 2024. Enrollment for a Phase 1 clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of ARCT-2304 (LUNAR-pandFLU candidate vaccine) is expected to begin before the end of 2024. 
 Key Updates on Arcturus-Owned mRNA Therapeutic Development Candidates 
 The following chart represents our current pipeline of Arcturus-owned mRNA therapeutic candidates: 

LUNAR-OTC/ARCT-810 

o A Phase 1b study in stable OTC-deficient adults was completed in the United States in September 2023. The trial assessed safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a single dose of ARCT-810, and exploratory biomarkers of drug activity. The Phase 1b study was a single ascending dose, placebo-controlled study that enrolled 16 adults with mild OTC-deficiency. ARCT-810 was generally safe and well tolerated at doses ranging from 0.1-0.5mg/kg and no serious or severe adverse events were observed. Sporadic infusion-related reactions (IRRs) were managed with symptomatic treatment and appeared to be less frequent with slower infusion rates. In plasma, ARCT-810 mRNA could be detected up to 4 weeks, while ionizable lipid was no longer measurable after 48 hours, indicating rapid degradation of the lipid nanoparticle that was utilized to deliver ARCT-810 mRNA. Study results were presented at the Society for Inherited Metabolic Disorders meeting in Charlotte, North Carolina in April 2024 and at the annual symposium for the Society for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism in Porto, Portugal in August 2024. 

o A Phase 2 double-blind study of ARCT-810 in OTC-deficient adolescents and adults in the European Union and United Kingdom completed dosing of eight subjects in August 2024 at the 0.3 mg/kg dose level. The participants in this group were randomized 3:1 to receive 6 doses of ARCT-810 or placebo administered every 14 days, and follow-up is ongoing. 

o We are expanding the Phase 2 clinical program of ARCT-810 to the U.S. with an open-label, multiple-dose study to evaluate pharmacodynamics and safety in adult and adolescent patients requiring clinical management for OTC-deficiency. The study is currently recruiting patients. 

o ARCT-810 was granted Orphan Drug Designation in June 2019, Fast Track Designation in May 2023, and Rare Pediatric Disease Designation in June 2023 by the FDA, and Orphan Medicinal Product Designation in August 2022 by the European Commission (EC). by the FDA. 

LUNAR-CF/ARCT-032 Our program for cystic fibrosis is being supported in part by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation CFF ). In 2023 we initiated and successfully completed a safety and tolerability Phase 1 single ascending dose study of ARCT-032 (LUNAR-CF), our mRNA therapeutic candidate for cystic fibrosis (CF). Thirty-two healthy participants (eight subjects in each of four dose cohorts) received a single inhaled dose of ARCT-032. A subsequent protocol amendment to transition to a safety and tolerability Phase 1b clinical study of ARCT-032 in adults with CF received regulatory approval in August 2023 and completed dosing and follow-up visits for 7 CF participants in August 2024, with each CF participant having received two administrations of ARCT-032 separated by two days. 

o In the Phase 1/1b clinical study, ARCT-032 was generally safe and well tolerated in healthy volunteers and in the participants with CF. Of the seven total CF participants in the Phase 1b study, six were being treated with CFTR modulators while one subject had Class I mutations that do not benefit from modulator therapy. No serious or severe adverse events (SAEs) were observed, and the safety profile was similar between healthy volunteers and CF participants. Mild, transient events of elevated temperature or feeling hot accompanied by other nonspecific symptoms were observed at dose levels that are higher than those planned for the Phase 2 study. In the CF subjects, lung function measured over 8 days did not demonstrate a discernable pattern or safety concern after 2 doses of 

19 

ARCT-032. Preliminary findings from the study were presented at the European CF Society Conference in June 2024 in Glasgow, Scotland, and at the North American CF Conference in September 2024 in Boston, MA. 

o We submitted an IND application at the end of July 2024, and on August 29, 2024, the FDA issued a Study May Proceed notification for an ARCT-032 Phase 2 multiple ascending dose study designed to identify a safe and effective dose in Class I (null) and other CF participants who do not benefit from CFTR modulators. This study is supported by safety and tolerability data collected in healthy volunteers (N = 32) and the two-administration Phase 1b study. 

o In February 2024, the European Commission (EC), based on a positive opinion issued by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), granted Orphan Medicinal Product Designation for ARCT-032 to treat CF. ARCT-032 was granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation in October 2023, and Orphan Drug Designation in November 2023 by the FDA. 

Updates on Research and Platform Activities 
 We continue to invest and improve our LUNAR-lipid mediated delivery of mRNA with continuous improvements in our mRNA and sa-mRNA platforms in conjunction with improvements in our next generation proprietary lipids to improve targeting, efficacy and safety profiles for both our vaccine and therapeutic protein platforms. This investment has led to key innovations ensuring that our LUNAR formulated drug product candidates have optimal characteristics for therapeutic use, which we believe sets us apart from other nucleic acid therapeutics and lipid-mediated delivery platforms. As such, we consider ourselves a leader in the research and development of mRNA therapeutics for multiple indications. 
 We continue to conduct exploratory platform development activities, including the evaluation of genome editing, and new targeting approaches, where our LUNAR and STARR platforms could potentially be useful for identification and development of additional products for our portfolio. 
 Discovery Programs Vaccine Programs (Lyme Disease and Gonorrhea) 
 Based on the clinical and regulatory validation of LUNAR and STARR technologies provided by the approval of KOSTAIVE, a self-amplifying messenger RNA (sa-mRNA) vaccine for COVID-19, we initiated new vaccine discovery programs earlier this year for Lyme disease and gonorrhea and continue to progress such programs. The discovery programs rely on the evidence of superior immunogenicity, durability, and breadth of immune response compared to conventional mRNA vaccines, as observed in the COVID-19 program. 
 Lyme disease is a bacterial infection and is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States. Infection can spread to joints, the heart and the nervous system. Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) that can infect the mucous membranes of the reproductive tract. It is the second most commonly reported bacterial sexually transmitted infection in the United States. We selected these diseases based on high unmet medical needs, good understanding of the path forward in vaccine target selection, and demonstration of proof of concept, as well as platform advantages that may be translated in a favorable vaccine product. 
 Updates on Supply and Manufacturing 
 We have built a global manufacturing footprint with our partners, including Aldevron, Catalent, Recipharm, Polymun and ARCALIS. With such collaborations we have established an Integrated Global Supply Chain Network with our primary and secondary sourcing contract development manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) based in the United States, EU and Asia for producing critical raw materials, drug substance, and packaged finished product. As the market for COVID vaccines shifts from multi-dose vial to lower and single-dose vial presentation, we continue, with our collaborator CSL Seqirus, to evaluate and pursue different forms of drug product presentations, advance manufacturing process and capabilities and technology transfers, and prepare for stockpiling and commercialization of COVID vaccines. 
 Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Report and our audited financial statements and related notes for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our historical results of operations and the year-to-year comparisons of our results of operations that follow are not necessarily indicative of future results.

Revenue 
 We enter into arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners and government agencies that may contain upfront payments, license fees for research and development arrangements, research and development funding, milestone payments, option exercise and exclusivity fees, royalties on future sales, consulting fees and payments for technology transfers. We expect that sales of KOSTAIVE by Meiji Holdings Co., Ltd, CSL s partner in Japan will commence in the fourth quarter of 2024 in Japan. However, revenues for us will be subject to a profit sharing mechanism whereby development costs are deducted from sales revenues prior to any distribution to the Company. The following table summarizes our total revenues for the periods indicated:

 Our research and development expenses consist primarily of external manufacturing costs, in-vivo research studies and clinical trials performed by contract research organizations, clinical and regulatory consultants, personnel related expenses, facility related expenses and laboratory supplies related to conducting research and development activities. Research and development expenses were 39.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 51.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to high manufacturing expenses in 2023 for Meiji supply batches and other clinical trial batches which were not incurred in 2024. The decrease was also due to lower facilities and equipment expenses in 2024. This was offset by an increase in clinical trial related expenses. Research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 151.4 million compared with 155.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to lower manufacturing expenses in 2023 for Meiji supply batches and other clinical trial batches which were not incurred in 2024. Additionally, there was a decrease in consulting expenses as well as facilities and equipment expenses in 2024. This was offset by increased clinical related expenses for the COVID program and increased personnel related expenses in 2024. We expect that our research and development efforts and associated costs will continue to be substantial over the next several years as our pipeline progresses. 
 Early-stage programs represent programs that are in the pre-clinical or Phase 1 clinical stage and may be partnered or unpartnered, including the LUNAR-CF and LUNAR-FLU programs. Discovery technologies represent our efforts to expand our product pipeline and are primarily related to pre-partnered studies and new capabilities assessment. For some of our programs, the activities are part of our collaborative and other relationships, and the expenses may be partially offset with funds that have been awarded to the Company. The expenses for early-stage programs and discovery technologies primarily consist of external manufacturing costs, lab supplies, equipment, and consulting and professional fees. Early-stage programs and discovery technologies expenses are expected to steadily increase over the coming years. 
 Personnel related expenses primarily consist of employee salaries and benefits, share-based compensation and consultants. Although such expenses increased during 2024 as compared to 2023, we expect that they will not increase over the next twelve months. 
 Facilities and equipment expenses primarily consist of rent expenses, common area maintenance charges, shipping costs, various costs of our offices and laboratories and depreciation expenses. Facilities and equipment expenses are not expected to increase during the next twelve months. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries and related benefits for our executive, administrative, legal and accounting functions and professional service fees for legal and accounting services as well as other general and administrative expenses. 
 General and administrative expenses were 13.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 13.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was attributable to decreased personnel expenses, partially offset by increased legal and other professional expenses, facilities expenses and other various general and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 remained consistent compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company expects that general and administrative expenses will remain relatively consistent over the next fiscal year with the current pipeline.

Interest income is generated on cash and cash equivalents. The decrease in interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily the result of decreased interest earned on investment accounts. The increase in interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily the result of increased interest earned on investment accounts caused by higher interest rates. Interest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was incurred in connection with the Western Alliance Agreement and the Singapore Loan, both of which have since been terminated.

 Other income and expense items primarily relate to gains and losses from foreign currency transactions. Additionally, we recorded a gain on debt extinguishment related to the Singapore Loan of 34.0 million during the first quarter of 2023 as a result of the Singapore Loan being forgiven. 
 Off-balance sheet arrangements 
 Through September 30, 2024, we have not entered into and did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial collaborations, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 From the Company s inception through the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company has funded its operations principally with the proceeds from the sale of capital stock, long-term debt and revenues earned through collaboration agreements and government contracts. Through the third quarter of 2024, we have achieved a total of approximately 462.1 million in upfront payments and milestones from CSL Seqirus, including a milestone of 25.0 million achieved in the current quarter with payment anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2024. At September 30, 2024, we had 294.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash. 
 CSL Seqirus, Inc. Collaboration and License Agreement 
 We entered into the CSL Collaboration Agreement with CSL Seqirus, a part of CSL Limited, one of the world s leading influenza vaccine providers, for the global exclusive rights to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize mRNA vaccines. 
 CSL Seqirus received exclusive global rights to our technology for vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), influenza and three other respiratory infectious diseases and non-exclusive rights to pandemic pathogens. We received an up-front payment of 200.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2022. We will be eligible to receive development milestones totaling more than 1.3 billion if all products are registered in the licensed fields. We will also be entitled to receive up to 3.0 billion in commercial milestones based on net sales of vaccines in the various fields. 
 In addition, we are entitled to receive a 40 share of net profits from COVID-19 vaccine sales and up to low double-digit royalties of annual net sales for vaccines against influenza and the other three specified infectious disease pathogens, as well as royalties on revenues from vaccines that may be developed for pandemic preparedness. 
 23 

The CSL Collaboration Agreement sets forth how CSL Seqirus and we shall collaborate to research and develop vaccine candidates. In the COVID-19 field, we will lead activities for certain regulatory filings for ARCT-154 in the US and Europe and for research and development activities of a next-generation COVID vaccine candidate. CSL Seqirus will lead and be responsible for all other research and development in COVID-19, influenza and the other fields. 
 Wells Fargo Credit Agreement 
 On April 21, 2023, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc. entered into a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association Wells Fargo whereby Wells Fargo agreed to make a 50.0 million revolving credit line available to the Company (the Wells Fargo Loan and each Wells Fargo Loan evidenced by a revolving line of credit note (the Note ). 
 Borrowings under the agreement will bear interest at a rate of 1.00 above either the Daily Simple SOFR or Term SOFR (as such terms are defined in the Wells Fargo Note), with SOFR being the rate per annum equal to the secured overnight financing rate as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. If an Event of Default (as defined in the credit agreement) occurs, then all Wells Fargo Loans shall bear interest at a rate equal to 2.00 above the interest rate applicable immediately prior to the occurrence of the Event of Default. As of September 30, 2024, no borrowings were made against the Wells Fargo Note. 
 The term of the agreement was originally two years, with an option for one-year renewals subject to Wells Fargo approval and the Company furnishing to Wells Fargo a non-refundable commitment fee equal to 0.25 of the Wells Fargo Loan amount for each such renewal. In June 2024, Arcturus Therapeutics and Wells Fargo entered into an amendment to the Note, whereby the term of the Note was extended by one year to April 2026. There is no penalty for terminating the agreement. There is no penalty for terminating the facility prior to the maturity date of the Wells Fargo Note. As collateral, we agreed to pledge 55.0 million in cash to be held in our securities accounts with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, an affiliate of Wells Fargo, pursuant to a security agreement. 
 Grant from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority 
 On August 31, 2022, we entered into a cost reimbursement contract (the BARDA Contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority BARDA ), a division of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to support the development of a low-dose pandemic influenza candidate based on our proprietary self-amplifying messenger RNA-based vaccine platform. The BARDA Contract is to support our non-clinical and pre-clinical development, early-stage clinical development through Phase 1, and associated drug product manufacturing, regulatory and quality-assurance activities over a period of three years. It provides for reimbursement by BARDA of our permitted costs up to 63.2 million. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining available funding net of revenue earned was 41.6 million. 
 Vinbiocare Agreement 
 During 2021, we entered into a technology license and technical support agreement and the framework drug substance supply agreement with Vinbiocare, a member of Vingroup Joint Stock Company (collectively, the Vinbiocare License Supply Agreements ), whereby we would provide technical expertise and support services to Vinbiocare to assist in the build out of an mRNA drug product manufacturing facility in Vietnam. We received an upfront payment in aggregate of 40.0 million as part of the Vinbiocare License and Supply Agreements. In October 2022, in association with the termination of the Vinbiocare License and Supply Agreements, we signed the Vinbiocare Support Agreement with Vinbiocare which continues Vinbiocare s clinical obligations and reserved a portion of the original 40.0 million upfront payment received from the License and Supply Agreements to be paid over the future periods. 
 The Vinbiocare Support Agreement requires us to pay Vinbiocare certain limited payments, including upon the occurrence of specified events through the first quarter of 2025. Vinbiocare is also eligible to receive a single digit percentage of amounts received by Arcturus on net sales, if any, of ARCT-154 (or next-generation COVID vaccine) up to a capped amount. 
 General Financial Resources 
 A portion of our current cash balance is expected to be utilized during fiscal year 2024 to fund (i) advances to our LUNAR-CF program in clinical trials, (ii) the continued Phase 2 trial of ARCT-810, our LUNAR-OTC candidate, (iii) expenses incurred prior to customer payments under the CSL Collaboration Agreement and BARDA Contract and (iv) continued exploratory activities related to our platform and other general administrative activities. 
 Our future capital requirements are difficult to forecast and will depend on many factors that are out of our control. If we are unable to maintain sufficient financial resources, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional needed financing on acceptable terms or at all. Additionally, equity or debt financings may have a dilutive effect on the holdings of our existing shareholders. 
 We expect to continue to incur additional losses in the long term, and we will need to execute on milestones within the CSL Collaboration Agreement, raise additional debt or equity financing or enter into additional partnerships to fund development. Our ability to transition to profitability is dependent on executing on milestones within the CSL Collaboration Agreement, successful clinical trials for OTC and CF and identifying and developing successful mRNA drug and vaccine candidates. If we are not able to 
 24 

achieve planned milestones or incur costs in excess of our forecasts, we will need to reduce discretionary spending, discontinue the development of some or all of our programs, which will delay part of our development programs, all of which will have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our intended business objectives. 
 Funding Requirements 
 We anticipate that we will continue to generate losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect the losses to increase as we continue the development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates, and begin commercialization of our products. As a result, we will require additional capital to fund our operations in order to support our long-term plans. We believe that our current cash position will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through at least the next twelve months, assuming, among other things, no significant unforeseen expenses and continued funding from partners at anticipated levels. We intend to seek additional capital through equity and/or debt financings, collaborative or other funding arrangements with partners or through other sources of financing. Should we seek additional financing from outside sources, we may not be able to raise such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may be required to scale back or discontinue the advancement of product candidates, reduce headcount, liquidate our assets, file for bankruptcy, reorganize, merge with another entity, or cease operations. 
 Our future funding requirements are difficult to forecast and will depend on many factors, including the following: 
 the development and commercialization of our LUNAR-COV19 and LUNAR-FLU vaccine candidates; 

the achievement of milestones under our strategic alliance agreements; 

maintaining and/or expanding our manufacturing network and capabilities; 

the terms and timing of any other strategic alliance, licensing and other arrangements that we may establish, including those with CSL Seqirus and CSL Seqirus arrangement with Meiji, and any related payments thereunder; 

the initiation, progress, timing and successful completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates, including OTC and CF; 

the number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue; 

the outcome, timing and cost of regulatory approvals; 

delays that may be caused by changing regulatory requirements; 

the cost and timing of hiring new employees to support our continued growth; 

the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing and defending patent claims; 

the costs and timing of procuring clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates; 

the costs and timing of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities; 

the costs associated with legal proceedings; 

the costs associated with potential litigation related to collaboration agreements; and 

the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products or technologies. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 We prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. As such, we make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable, based upon information available to us. These judgments involve making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our reported results of operations and financial condition. We describe our significant accounting policies more fully in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from the information provided in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in the 2023 Annual Report. 
 25 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of interest rates in the United States. Due to the nature of our cash and cash equivalents, we believe that we are not subject to any material market risk exposure. We do not have any foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) and Rule 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, our management, including our principal executive officer, our principal financial officer and our principal accounting officer, conducted an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, management has concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below. 
 The Company s disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to ensure that: (i) information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit to the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and (ii) material information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and the CFO, as appropriate, to allow for accurate and timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud. The effectiveness of our or any system of disclosure controls and procedures, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the system will be met and is subject to certain limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing, and evaluating controls and procedures and the assumptions used in identifying the likelihood of future events. 
 Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financing Reporting Existing as of September 30, 2024 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 Management concluded that the material weaknesses disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 continued to exist as of September 30, 2024. Specifically, management concluded that the following material weaknesses exist as of September 30, 2024: 
 A material weakness related to information technology general controls ITGCs that support our financial reporting processes; Management determined that we did not maintain effective controls over (i) user access to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and adequately restrict user and privileged access to financial applications, programs and data to the appropriate personnel; (ii) program change management for financial applications to ensure that information technology IT program and data changes affecting financial IT applications and underlying accounting records are identified, tested, authorized and implemented appropriately; and (iii) IT operations controls to ensure that critical interface jobs are monitored. As a result, our related IT dependent manual and application controls that rely upon the affected ITGCs, or information coming from IT systems with affected ITGCs, were also deemed ineffective. 

A material weakness related to revenue recognition. Management determined that certain control activities within the area of revenue did not operate effectively, specifically controls over the review of costs incurred in satisfaction of our performance obligations under collaboration arrangements. 

Notwithstanding the identified material weaknesses, management does not believe that the deficiencies had an adverse effect on our reported operating results or financial condition, and management has determined that the financial statements and other information included in this report and other periodic filings present fairly in all material respects our financial condition and results of operations at and for the periods presented. 
 Plan for Remediation of Material Weaknesses 
 Our remediation efforts are ongoing, and we will continue our initiatives to implement measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weaknesses are remediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. We are committed to making the necessary changes and improvements to our system of controls to address the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described above. 
 Our renewed emphasis of designing and implementing improved processes and controls involves but is not limited to the following: 
 26 

Expand available resources with experience designing and implementing control activities, including ITGCs and automated controls, both by hiring internally and the use of third-party consultations and specialists. 

Adjust access profiles in IT systems and relevant software, and adjust access review controls accordingly. 

Refine the control to identify access profiles in IT systems and software that result in risks of segregation of duties. 

Perform ongoing training with control performers to improve documentation that supports effective control activities, including evidence over the completeness and accuracy of information produced by the Company. 

Add additional technical accounting resource to review our revenue accounting along with financial disclosures for collaboration arrangements on a quarterly basis. 

We are in the process of implementing the remediation activities as of the date of this report and believe that upon completion, we will have strengthened our ITGCs, and controls related to accounting for collaboration arrangements to address and successfully remediate the identified material weaknesses. However, control weaknesses are not considered remediated until new internal controls have been operational for a period of time, are tested, and management concludes that these controls are operating effectively. We expect to complete the remediation activities in the fiscal year 2024. We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these remediation measures, and we will make any changes to the design of this plan and take such other actions that we deem appropriate given the circumstances. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(d) and Rule 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act, our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial and accounting officer, conducted an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any other changes occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial and accounting officer concluded that there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the periods covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
