For details see note 18 - Change in Fiscal Year. 

The
condensed consolidated financial statements include all accounts of the Company and its majority owned and controlled subsidiaries. The
Company consolidates entities in which it owns and controls operations. All intercompany transactions
and balances among consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated. 

The
following chart describes the Company s ownership of various subsidiaries: 

The
Company mainly focuses on the F B business. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, substantially all of the Company s
business was generated by its wholly owned subsidiaries, and from HWH World Inc. HWH Korea ), respectively, and 
and from F B business, respectively. F B business was generated by the following subsidiaries at September 30, 2024 and 2023,

 and from Hapi Caf SG Pte. Ltd. HCSGPL ), and from Alset F B (PLQ) Pte. Ltd. F BPLQ and and from Ketomei Pte. Ltd. KPL ). HWH Korea was incorporated in the Republic of Korea South Korea on May 7, 2019. HWH Korea is in the business of sourcing and distributing dietary supplements and other health products through its network
of members in South Korea. HWH Korea generates product sales via its direct sale model as products are sold to its members. Through the
use of a Hapi Gig platform that combines e-commerce, social media, and a customized rewards system, HWH Korea equips, trains, and empowers
its members. F B1 was incorporated in Singapore on April 10, 2017, HCSGPL was incorporated in Singapore on April 4, 2022, F BPLQ
was incorporated in Singapore on November 11, 2022 and KPL was incorporated in Singapore on September 17, 2019. F B1, HCSGPL, F BPLQ

The
Company reviews the carrying value of property and equipment for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying
value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition.
In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to an
amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of assets. The factors considered by management in performing this assessment
include current operating results, trends, and prospects, as well as the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic
factors. 

As
at September 30, 2024, the Company has determined the value-in-use to be zero based on the discounted cash flow of the cash generating
unit CGU ), which involves the cash flow projections covering a 3-year period and the fair value less cost of disposal
to be zero considering the re-sale value of these assets to be insignificant. Based on the assessment, the recoverable amount of the
CGU was determined to be zero, which was below the carrying amount of these non-financial assets. Accordingly, impairment losses on plant
and equipment of are recognized in general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statement of operations
and other comprehensive loss for the financial year ended September 30, 2024. 

Product
Sales: The Company s performance obligation is to transfer ownership of its products to its members. The Company generally
recognizes revenue when product is delivered to its members. Revenue is recorded net of applicable taxes, allowances, refunds or returns.
The Company receives the net sales price in cash or through credit card payments at the point of sale. 

If
any member returns a product to the Company on a timely basis, they may obtain a replacement product from the Company for such returned
product. We do not have buyback program. However, when the customer requests a return and management decides that the refund is necessary,
we initiate the refund after deducting all the benefits that a member has earned. The returns are deducted from our sales revenue on
our financial statements. Allowances for product and membership returns are provided at the time the sale is recorded. This accrual is
based upon historical return rates for each country and the relevant return pattern, which reflects anticipated returns to be received
over a period of up to 12 months following the original sale. Product and membership returns for the three months ended September 30,
2024 and 2023 were both 0 . Product and membership returns for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 0 and ,
respectively. The table below represents a breakout of the returns related to product sales and the returns related to memberships:

condition), the aging of account balances, historical credit loss experience, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness, and
the existence of sources of payment. The Company also establishes an allowance for credit losses for specific receivables when it is

information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. 

Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections
about future events. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us
that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results,
levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify
forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, should, could, would, 
 expect, plan, anticipate, believe, estimate, continue, 
or the negative of such terms or other similar expressions. Factors that might cause or contribute to such a discrepancy include, but
are not limited to, those described in our other SEC filings. 

Overview 

Our
newly acquired business started in South Korea with a single-level membership marketing model with limited products for sale. We registered
the business on April 1, 2019, and we started selling founders package on July 1, 2019. While we had been profitable and growing, the
COVID-19 pandemic had a material adverse effect on such growth and profits. Due to the decline in membership and revenue starting in
2020, we reorganized our internal staff by adding a broader team in each of the United States, Hong Kong and Singapore with direct selling
and business development experience to head up and expand our operations across various geographies and revised our business plan to
a tiered membership model in 2022, with more products and services to be made available to our members. We created a new corporate structure,
with subsidiaries in the U.S., Hong Kong and Singapore, that would allow for quick geographical expansion and turned our focus to the
Hapi Caf development. 

We
have 9,811 individuals with founding member status. This is a privileged class that will be able to enjoy continuous membership benefits
in time to come, given that they have trusted the Company and joined at an early stage. Such benefits include the ability to purchase
new memberships, in the model described below, at a favorable rate to be determined by the Company. They will also continue to be able
to earn affiliate commissions as they sell our products in the marketplace and enjoy discounted rates when visiting Hapi Caf s
until further notice. The total number of founding members was capped at 10,000. The Company is in the midst of implementing a new membership
model that operates on a yearly subscription basis. While we are not currently selling memberships, we intend to resume membership sales
under this new model. 

Members
will get exclusive discounts on Hapi Marketplace products, priority invites to product launch events and other parties, and can earn passive
income when a member s referral signs up for membership or makes an initial purchase of Hapi Marketplace products through them. 

Our
operations include: 

Hapi
Marketplace. On November 4, 2024, the Company announced the launch of its business-to-consumer marketplace, Hapi
Marketplace. Hapi Marketplace features a selection of over forty-seven product categories including wellness, elderly care, auto
accessories and more. Launching first in the United States, we intend for Hapi Marketplace to expand in the near
future to South Korea and Hong Kong, followed by further expansion across Asia. 

The various aspects of the Hapi Marketplace will be
launched in phases in different regions, each with their own timeline, depending on the completion of logistical aspects for implementation (i.e., payment gateway systems, business licenses, banking set up, import licenses, managerial
resources, etc.) This will be an on-going process as we expand our product and service offering range. 

There
are also certain limited products currently for sale at our Hapi Caf s, including spaghetti, a gig-economy business book and
certain skincare products. 

25 

Hapi
Caf s, which are, and will be, in-person, location-based social experiences, offer members the opportunity to build a
sense of community with like-minded customers who share a potential interest in our products. The cafes are designed to operate sustainably as standalone businesses. The cafes
also seek to be an avenue to create awareness to and educate
potential and existing members about the products and services of HWH, providing us with the chance to significantly increase our membership base as
well as increase the amounts spent by our members on our affiliates products and services. Each of our caf s is a Hapi
Caf . We opened proof-of-concept Hapi Caf locations in Seoul, the Republic of Korea and Singapore in May and July
2022, respectively, one more opened in Seoul, the Republic of Korea in May 2024, and plan to open additional Hapi Caf s as we
beta test and further improve our business concept. We intend to grow our memberships as we grow the number of Hapi Caf s around
the world. Hapi Cafe is positioned to be an integral part of HWH s business model. In June 2024, the Company decision to close
the caf under F BPLQ was driven by the unsustainable revenue it generated. We believe it is more strategic to refocus our
efforts and resources on other business ventures that have greater growth potential. 

Our
travel business is in the planning stage as we are working with our affiliates to determine the market-by-market services. Through our
travel business, we plan to offer exclusive access to unpublished rates and discounts on air travel, cruises, car rentals, hotels, and
resorts for members. 

Hapi
Wealth Builder seeks to provide participants the opportunity to attend courses, workshops, and coaching sessions in person, fostering
a collaborative learning environment for those dedicated to learning investment in equities and wealth-building strategies. The team
has been diligently producing digital content for Hapi Wealth Builder and working to collaborate with the right partners to launch the
program and make it available to members. Hapi Wealth will leverage the wealth of knowledge and experience of its
leaders to make wealth building accessible and effective for its members. Our unique community-centric approach will offer members tools
for making informed financial decisions while creating pathways for sustained growth. 

On October
31, 2024, we announced that the Company has scheduled the launch of Hapi Wealth, a program dedicated to providing comprehensive education
in equity investment and wealth-building strategies. A soft launch is currently scheduled for November 2024 in China and elsewhere in
Asia, with the official launch set for January 2025. We are targeting a rollout in North America in 2025 as well. 

To further
support its mission, Hapi Wealth is opening its China headquarters, designed as a conducive environment for individuals to participate
in tutorials and workshops. The hub will offer participants the opportunity to attend courses, workshops, and coaching sessions in person,
fostering a collaborative learning environment for those dedicated to learning investment in equities and wealth-building strategies.

Termination

Fund I, LP MSOF ), Meteora Capital Partners, LP MCP ), Meteora Select Trading Opportunities Master, LP MSTO and Meteora Strategic Capital, LLC, MSC , and together with MSOF, MCP and MSTO, are referred to herein collectively as
 Meteora ). The Subscription Agreement was subsequently terminated. The Company and Meteora entered into a Settlement Agreement
as of April 11, 2024 (the Settlement Agreement ). Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the Company paid Meteora 200,000,
and agreed that Meteora could retain 100,000 already paid to Meteora. 

Impact
of Inflation 

We
believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or the
year ended December 31, 2023. We cannot assure you that future inflation will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and
financial condition. 

Impact
of Foreign Exchange Rates 

The
effect of foreign exchange rate changes on the intercompany loans (under ASC 830), which mostly consist of loans from Singapore to South
Korea and which were approximately 0.7 million and 2.1 million on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, the fluctuation
of foreign currency transaction gain or loss was included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive Income.
Because the intercompany loan balances between Singapore and South Korea will remain at approximately 2.7 million over the next year,
we expect this fluctuation of foreign exchange rates to still impact the results of operations in 2024, especially given that the foreign
exchange rate may and is expected to be volatile. If the amount of intercompany loan is lowered in the future, the effect will also be
reduced. However, at this moment, we do not expect to repay the intercompany loans in the short term. 

Emerging
Growth Company Status 

We
are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various
reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. Section 107
of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided
in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging
growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
We have elected to take advantage of these exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company or until we affirmatively and
irrevocably opt out of this exemption. 

31 

Controls
and Procedures 

We
are not currently required to maintain an effective system of internal controls as defined by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
Only in the event that we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer would we be required to comply with the
independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement. Further, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company as
defined in the JOBS Act, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to
other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent
registered public accounting firm attestation requirement. 

Management
is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements included in this prospectus. The financial statements
have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and reflect management s
judgment and estimates concerning effects of events and transactions that are accounted for or disclosed. 

Management
is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to our ability to record, process, summarize and report reliable data.
Management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control over financial reporting, including
the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of internal control. Accordingly, even effective internal control
over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement presentation. Further, because of
changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time. 

In
order to ensure that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, management regularly assesses controls and did so most
recently for its financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. This assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over
financial reporting described in the Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO)
of the Treadway Commission. In connection with management s evaluation of the effectiveness of our company s internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, management determined that our company did not maintain effective controls over financial
reporting due to having a limited staff with U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting experience. Management determined that the ineffective controls
over financial reporting constitute a material weakness. To remediate such weaknesses, we plan to appoint additional qualified personnel
with financial accounting, GAAP and SEC experience. 

This
prospectus does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules
of the SEC that permit us to provide only management s report in this prospectus. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise
required under this item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons
performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, as such
term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer concluded that during the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 covered
by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.
