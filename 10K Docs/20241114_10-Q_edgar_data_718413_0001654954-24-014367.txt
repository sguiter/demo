securities Taxable Municipal securities Tax-exempt Municipal securities Agency MBS ABS and OAS CMO Other investments Total The Company had investments in Agency MBS exceeding 10 of shareholders equity with a book value of million and million, respectively, and a fair value of million and million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Investment securities pledged as collateral for repurchase agreements consisted of certain U.S. GSE debt securities, Agency MBS, ABS and OAS, and CMO. These repurchase agreements mature daily. The aggregate amortized cost and fair value of these pledged investments as of the balance sheet dates were as follows: December 31, 2023 Investment securities pledged as collateral for BTFP borrowings consisted of U.S. Government securities and U.S. GSE debt securities with an aggregate amortized cost and fair value of these pledged investments as of the balance sheet dates as follows: December 31, 2023 There were no sales of debt securities during the first nine months of 2024 or 2023. The scheduled maturities of debt securities as of the balance sheet dates were as follows: Due from one to five years Due from five to ten years Due after ten years Agency MBS Total 13 Table of Contents Due from one to five years Due from five to ten years Due after ten years Agency MBS Total Agency MBS are not due at a single maturity date and have not been allocated to maturity groupings for purposes of the maturity table. Debt securities with unrealized losses as of the balance sheet dates are presented in the table below. U.S. Government securities Taxable Municipal securities Tax-exempt Municipal securities Agency MBS ABS and OAS CMO Other investments Total December 31, 2023 U.S. GSE debt securities U.S. Government securities Taxable Municipal securities Tax-exempt Municipal securities Agency MBS ABS and OAS CMO Other investments Total The Company adopted ASU No. 2016-13 effective January 1, 2023, which requires credit losses on debt securities AFS to be recorded in an allowance for credit losses and eliminates the concept of OTTI for debt securities AFS. Under the ASU, if the Company intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, then the credit loss is recorded through an allowance rather than as a write-down of the security as under prior GAAP. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not have the intent to sell, nor was it more likely than not that we would be required to sell, any of the debt securities AFS in an unrealized loss position as of such dates prior to recovery and determined that no individual debt securities in an unrealized loss position represented credit losses that would require an allowance for credit losses. The Company concluded that the unrealized losses as of the balance sheet dates were primarily attributed to increases in market interest rates since these securities were purchased under other market conditions. Accordingly, there was no ACL on AFS debt securities as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 14 Table of Contents Purchased (1) Commercial real estate Municipal Residential real estate - 1st lien Residential real estate - Jr lien Consumer Total loans ACL Deferred net loan costs Net loans (1) As of September 30, 2024, purchased loans consisted of in commercial loans and in consumer loans, compared to and , respectively, as of December 31, 2023.

The Company groups credit risk into Groups A, B and C. The manner the Company utilizes to assign risk grouping is driven by loan purpose. Commercial purpose loans are individually risk graded while the retail portion of the portfolio is generally grouped by delinquency pool. Group A loans - Pass are loans that are expected to perform as agreed under their respective terms. Such loans carry a normal level of risk that does not require management attention beyond that warranted by the loan or loan relationship characteristics, such as loan size or relationship size. Group A loans include commercial purpose loans that are individually risk rated, including purchased and retail loans that are rated by pool. Group A retail loans include performing consumer and residential real estate loans. Residential real estate loans are loans to individuals secured by 1-4 family homes, including first mortgages, home equity and home improvement loans. Loan balances fully secured by deposit accounts or that are fully guaranteed by the federal government are considered acceptable risk. Group B loans Special Mention - are loans that require greater attention than the acceptable risk loans in Group A. Characteristics of such loans may include, but are not limited to, borrowers that are experiencing negative operating trends such as reduced sales or margins, borrowers that have exposure to adverse market conditions such as increased competition or regulatory burden, or borrowers that have had unexpected or adverse changes in management. These loans have a greater likelihood of migrating to an unacceptable risk level if these characteristics are left unchecked. Group B is limited to commercial purpose loans that are individually risk rated. Group C loans Substandard/Doubtful are loans that have distinct shortcomings that require a greater degree of management attention. Examples of these shortcomings include a borrower's inadequate capacity to service debt, poor operating performance, or insolvency. These loans are more likely to result in repayment through collateral liquidation. Group C loans range from those that are likely to sustain some loss if the shortcomings are not corrected, to those for which loss is imminent and non-accrual treatment is warranted. Group C loans include individually rated commercial purpose loans and retail loans adversely rated in accordance with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council s Uniform Retail Credit Classification Policy. Group C retail loans include 1-4 family residential real estate loans and home equity loans past due 90 days or more with loan-to-value ratios greater than 60 , home equity loans 90 days or more past due where the Bank does not hold first mortgage, irrespective of loan-to-value, loans in bankruptcy where repayment is likely but not yet established, and lastly consumer loans that are 90 days or more past due. Commercial purpose loan ratings are assigned by the commercial account officer; for larger and more complex commercial loans, the credit rating is a collaborative assignment by the lender and the credit analyst. The credit risk rating is based on the borrower's expected performance, i.e., the likelihood that the borrower will be able to service its obligations in accordance with the loan terms. Credit risk ratings are meant to measure risk versus simply record history. Assessment of expected future payment performance requires consideration of numerous factors. While past performance is part of the overall evaluation, expected performance is based on an analysis of the borrower's financial strength, and historical and projected factors such as size and financing alternatives, capacity and cash flow, balance sheet and income statement trends, the quality and timeliness of financial reporting, and the quality of the borrower s management. Other factors influencing the credit risk rating to a lesser degree include collateral coverage and control, guarantor strength and commitment, documentation, structure and covenants and industry conditions. There are uncertainties inherent in this process. 17 Table of Contents Special mention Substandard/Doubtful Total Purchased: Pass Total Commercial real estate: Pass Special mention Substandard/Doubtful Total Municipal: Pass Total Residential real estate - 1st lien: Pass Special mention Substandard/Doubtful Total Residential real estate - Jr lien: Pass Substandard/Doubtful Total Consumer Pass Total Total Loans Current period gross charge-offs Commercial Industrial Commercial real estate Consumer Total current period gross charge-offs 18 Table of Contents Commercial real estate Residential real estate - 1st lien Residential real estate - Jr lien Totals Commercial real estate Residential real estate - 1st lien Residential real estate - Jr lien Totals The following is an age analysis of past due loans (including non-accrual) as of the balance sheet dates, by portfolio segment: Purchased Commercial real estate Municipal Residential real estate - 1st lien Residential real estate - Jr lien Consumer Totals Purchased Commercial real estate Municipal Residential real estate - 1st lien Residential real estate - Jr lien Consumer Totals For all loan segments, loans over 30 days past due are considered delinquent. 19 Table of Contents Commercial real estate Residential real estate - 1st lien Totals December 31, 2023 Commercial industrial Commercial real estate Residential real estate - 1st lien Totals (1) Including, but not limited to, inventory, equipment, and accounts receivable, but excluding real estate. Residential real estate loans in process of foreclosure as of the balance sheet dates were comprised of the following: December 31, 2023 Allowance for credit losses Effective January 1, 2023, with the adoption of CECL, the Company established the ACL through a provision for credit losses charged to earnings. Credit losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that future payments of a loan balance are unlikely. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Unsecured loans are charged off when they become uncollectible and no later than 120 days past due. Unsecured loans to customers who subsequently file bankruptcy, are charged off within 30 days of receipt of the notification of filing or by the end of the month in which the loans become 120 days past due, whichever occurs first. For secured loans, both residential and commercial, the potential loss on impaired loans is carried as a loan loss reserve specific allocation; the loss portion is charged off when collection of the full loan appears unlikely. The unsecured portion of a real estate loan is that portion of the loan exceeding the "fair value" of the collateral less the estimated cost to sell. The value of the collateral is determined in accordance with the Company s appraisal policy. The unsecured portion of an impaired real estate secured loan is charged off by the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. As described below, the allowance consists of general and specific components. However, the entire allowance is available to absorb losses in the loan portfolio, regardless of general or specific components considered in determining the amount of the allowance. General component The general component of the ACL is based on methodologies, inputs, and assumptions utilized to estimate lifetime credit losses when applied to the following loan segments: commercial and industrial, purchased loans, CRE, municipal, residential real estate 1st lien, residential real estate Jr lien and consumer loans. The Company does not disaggregate its portfolio segments further into classes. The Company utilizes a DCF approach to calculate the expected loss for each portfolio segment. Within the DCF model, probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) assumptions are applied to calculate the expected loss for each segment. PD is management s estimate of the probability the asset will default within a given timeframe and LGD is management s estimate of the percentage of assets not expected to be collected due to default. The Company's PD and LGD assumptions may be derived from internal historical default and loss experience or from external data where there are not statistically meaningful loss events for a loan segment, or it does not have default and loss data that covers a full economic cycle. 20 Table of Contents 21 Table of Contents 22 Table of Contents As of the balance sheet dates, the Company had committed to lend additional amounts totaling to the borrower whose loans are included in the table above.

FASB ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments , requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet, if the fair values can be reasonably determined. Fair value is best determined based upon quoted market prices. However, in many instances, there are no quoted market prices for the Company s various financial instruments. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques using observable inputs when available. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. Accordingly, fair value estimates may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument. Topic 825 excludes certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments from its disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented may not necessarily represent the underlying fair value of the Company. 26 Table of Contents Debt securities AFS Restricted equity securities Loans and loans held-for-sale, net of ACL Commercial industrial Purchased Commercial real estate Municipal Residential real estate - 1st lien Residential real estate - Jr lien Consumer MSRs (1) Accrued interest receivable Financial liabilities: Deposits Other deposits Brokered deposits Short-term advances Long-term advances Repurchase agreements Operating lease obligations Finance lease obligations Subordinated debentures Accrued interest payable (1) Reported fair value represents all MSRs for loans serviced by the Company, regardless of carrying amount. 27 Table of Contents Debt securities AFS Restricted equity securities Loans and loans held-for-sale, net of ACL Commercial industrial Purchased Commercial real estate Municipal Residential real estate 1 st lien Residential real estate Jr lien Consumer MSRs (1) Accrued interest receivable Financial liabilities: Deposits Other deposits Overnight borrowings Short-term advances Long-term advances Repurchase agreements Operating lease obligations Finance lease obligations Subordinated debentures Accrued interest payable (1) Reported fair value represents all MSRs for loans serviced by the Company, regardless of carrying amount. per common share, payable November 1, 2024, to shareholders of record as of October 15, 2024.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Period Ended September 30, 2024 The following discussion analyzes the consolidated financial condition of Community Bancorp. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Community National Bank, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and its consolidated results of operations for the three-month and nine-month interim periods and one year period presented. The Company is considered a smaller reporting company and a non-accelerated filer under the disclosure rules of the SEC. Accordingly, the Company has elected to provide its statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in shareholders equity for a two-year, rather than a three-year, period and provide certain other smaller reporting company scaled disclosures where management deems it appropriate. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in its 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. Please refer to Note 1 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a listing of acronyms and defined terms used throughout the following discussion. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD A) contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, regarding the results of operations, financial condition and business of the Company and its subsidiary. Words used in the discussion below such as "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "estimates," projects , "plans," assumes , "predicts," may , might , will , could , should and similar expressions, indicate that management of the Company is making forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. They necessarily involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Examples of forward looking statements included in this discussion include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the estimated contingent liability related to assumptions made within the asset/liability management process; management's expectations as to the future interest rate environment and the Company's related liquidity level; credit risk expectations relating to the Company's loan portfolio and off-balance sheet commitments; and management's general outlook for the future performance of the Company and the local or national economy. Although forward-looking statements are based on management's expectations and estimates as of the date they are made, many of the factors that could influence or determine actual results are unpredictable and not within the Company's control. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements include, among others, the following possibilities: interest rates change in such a way as to negatively affect loan demand, the local economy or the Company's net income, asset valuations or margins; general economic or business conditions, either nationally, regionally or locally, deteriorate, resulting in a decline in credit quality or a diminished demand for the Company's products and services; the impact of inflation and slowing economic growth on the Company s customers and on its financial results and performance; the effect of United States monetary and fiscal policies, including deficit spending and the interest rate policies of the FRB and its regulation of the money supply; changes in applicable accounting policies, practices and standards; the geographic concentration of the Company s loan portfolio and deposit base; reductions in deposit levels, which necessitate increased borrowings to fund loans and sale of investment securities; increases in the level of nonperforming assets and charge-offs; changes in federal or state tax laws or policy; changes in laws or government rules, including the rules of the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or the way in which courts or government agencies interpret or implement those laws or rules, increase our costs of doing business, causing us to limit or change our product offerings or pricing, or otherwise adversely affect the Company's business; regulatory responses to high profile bank failures increase our costs of operation, including through regulatory compliance changes and higher FDIC deposit insurance assessments to replenish the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF); 29 Table of Contents competitive pressures increase among financial service providers in the Company's northern New England market area or in the financial services industry generally, including competitive pressures from non-bank lenders, payment systems and other financial service providers, from increasing consolidation and integration of financial service providers, and from changes in technology and delivery systems; cybersecurity risks, including risks to our vendors, could adversely affect the Company s business, financial performance or reputation and could result in financial liability for losses incurred by customers or others due to data breaches or other compromise of the Company s information security systems; higher-than-expected costs are incurred relating to information technology or difficulties arise in implementing technological enhancements; management s risk management measures may not be completely effective; changes in consumer and business spending, borrowing and savings habits; operational and internal system failures due to changes in normal business practices, including remote working for Company staff; increased cybercrime and payment system risk due to increased usage by customers of online, mobile and other remote banking channels; the ongoing challenges to find qualified workers to maintain a stable workforce; losses due to the fraudulent or negligent conduct of third parties, including the Company s service providers, customers and employees; and adverse changes in the credit rating of U.S. government debt. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements as they speak only as of the date they are made. The Company does not undertake, and disclaims any obligation, to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect the occurrence or anticipated occurrence of events or circumstances after the date of this Report, except as required by applicable law. The Company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Under SEC Regulation G, public companies making disclosures containing financial measures that are not in accordance with GAAP must also disclose, along with each non-GAAP financial measure, certain additional information, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the closest comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as a statement of the company s reasons for utilizing the non-GAAP financial measure. The SEC has exempted from the definition of non-GAAP financial measures certain commonly used financial measures that are not based on GAAP. However, three non-GAAP financial measures commonly used by financial institutions, namely tax-equivalent net interest income and tax-equivalent net interest margin (as presented in the tables in the section labeled Interest Income Versus Interest Expense (NII)) and core earnings (as defined and discussed in the Results of Operations section), have not been specifically exempted by the SEC, and may therefore constitute non-GAAP financial measures under Regulation G. We are unable to state with certainty whether the SEC would regard those measures as subject to Regulation G. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company s financial performance and facilitate comparisons with the performance of other financial institutions. However, that information should be considered supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. OVERVIEW The Company s consolidated assets as of September 30, 2024, were 1.18 billion compared to 1.10 billion as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 7.1 . Changes in the asset base included an increase in loans of 67.3 million, or 8.0 , and an increase in cash of 29.4 million, or 143.8 , which was partially offset by a decrease of 20.2 million, or 10.6 , in investment securities. The increase in the loan portfolio was primarily attributable to an increase of 6.2 million in commercial industrial loans, 45.2 million in CRE loans, 11.1 million in municipal loans, and 8.4 million in residential first and Jr. lien loans, which was minimally offset by a decrease of 2.2 million in purchased loans. The decrease in the investment portfolio was due in part to maturities in the U.S. Government securities portfolio and paydowns in the MBS and CMO portfolios. In addition, cash flows from the investment portfolio were used to fund loan growth and other liquidity needs, rather than to purchase new investment securities. Total deposits as of September 30, 2024, were 929.6 million compared to 897.0 million as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 32.6 million, or 3.6 . Year to date, time deposits increased 50.7 million, or 40.9 while money market funds decreased 10.3 million, or 8.5 , and savings accounts decreased 7.4 million, or 4.9 . The Company has been offering competitive interest rates for retail time deposits, and accessing the brokered deposit market, accounting for the increase in these funds. An increase in deposit balances is typical in the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year, with balances increasing through year end due in part to municipal accounts collecting tax payments. The increase in deposit balances was less than the loan growth, requiring the continued use of borrowed funds as a supplemental funding source. 30 Table of Contents Total interest income increased approximately 1.9 million, or 15.6 , for the third quarter of 2024, compared to the same quarter in 2023, and 6.0 million, or 17.5 , for the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The growth of the loan portfolio originated at higher interest rates, as well as adjustable-rate loans repricing to current market rates, helped to support the year-over-year increase in interest income. These increases in total interest income were offset by significant increases in total interest expense, which increased 1.6 million, or 45.1 , for the third quarter of 2024, compared to the same quarter of 2023 and 6.1 million, or 68.4 , for the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The higher rate environment and the reliance on wholesale funding has increased borrowing costs and put more pressure on competitive deposit pricing, resulting in an increase in the rates paid on the Company s money market and time deposit accounts. However, the 50 bps FRB rate cut late in the third quarter of 2024 could possibly have a moderate influence in future periods. Please refer to the interest rate sensitivity discussion in the Interest Rate Risk and Asset and Liability Management section for more information on the impact that the actions of the FRB s FOMC in regulating interest rates, and changes in the yield curve, could have on our net interest income. The credit loss expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was determined under ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, commonly referenced as the Current Expected Credit Losses, or CECL, which the Company adopted effective January 1, 2023. The credit loss expense for the third quarter of 2024 was 460,745 compared to 240,889 for the same quarter of 2023 and 1.1 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 808,557 for the same period in 2023, resulting in increases of 219,856, or 91.3 , and 297,349, or 36.8 , respectively, between periods. The current period credit loss expense considers a number of factors, including loan growth and changes in balances of the loan categories within the current portfolio, changes in forecasts, historical loss rate and qualitative factors. During the third quarter of 2024, certain qualitative factors used in the ACL calculation were adjusted to better reflect expected credit losses in the loan portfolio. Please refer to Note 5 of the unaudited consolidated financial statements as well as the ACL and credit loss expense discussion in the Credit Risk section of this MD A. Consolidated net income for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 248,258 to 3.1 million compared to 3.4 million for the same quarter of 2023, and for the first nine months of 2024 consolidated net income decreased 1.2 million to 8.7 million compared to 9.9 million for the same period of 2023. Year over year, the 6.1 million increase in interest expense, despite a 6.0 million increase in interest income, was a contributing factor to the decrease in net income, along with a 1.5 million increase in non-interest expense. These changes, along with other significant changes in non-interest income and non-interest expense are discussed in the appropriate sections of this MD A. Equity capital increased to 98.3 million, with a book value per share of 17.36 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 89.0 million and a book value per share of 15.87 as of December 31, 2023. The increase in equity capital between periods reflected the combined effect of net income of 8.7 million for the first nine months of 2024, along with a decrease in unrealized losses in the investment portfolio of 3.5 million, net of tax, reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which was offset in part by dividends paid totaling 3.8 million. The unrealized loss position in the investment portfolio is considered by management as temporary and does not impact the Company s regulatory capital ratios. During the month of July sections of northern Vermont were hit with catastrophic flash flooding following heavy rainfall from two separate storms, leading to significant road washouts and flooding homes and businesses. The portions of the Company s service area most impacted were Lamoille, Caledonia, Essex and Orleans counties. None of the Company s branches sustained any flood damage. The impact to the Bank s customers appears to be manageable. On September 11, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.24 per common share, an increase of 0.01 or 4.3 from the previous level, payable on November 1, 2024, to shareholders of record on October 15, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s capital ratios, and those of our subsidiary Bank, were in excess of applicable regulatory requirements. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company adopted a stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to 275,000 shares of the Company s common stock, representing approximately 5 of the outstanding common shares. Purchases under the program may be on such terms, including price, as market conditions warrant, and may be made through open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase authorization expires in five years, unless extended, or earlier terminated, by the Board. Notwithstanding the program s five-year term, the Board will review and re-evaluate the program annually in light of the Company s then current capital needs, the number and cost of shares repurchased, the number of shares remaining for repurchase under the authorization, and other relevant factors, and management will confer with the FRBB regarding the program, as appropriate in the circumstances. As of September 30, 2024, no shares had been repurchased. 31 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Company s consolidated financial statements are prepared according to U.S. GAAP. The preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The SEC has defined a company s critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of the Company s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the Company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often because of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Because of the significance of these estimates and assumptions, there is a high likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported for the Company under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates. Management evaluates on an ongoing basis its judgment as to which policies are considered to be critical and communicates all evaluations with the Company s Audit Committee. The Company s critical accounting policies govern: the ACL; OREO; valuation of residential MSRs; and the carrying value of goodwill. These policies are described in the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K in the section titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and in Note 1 (Significant Accounting Policies) to the audited consolidated financial statements. There were no material changes during the first nine months of 2024 in the Company s critical accounting policies. ACL - Management believes that the calculation of the ACL is a critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. In estimating the ACL, management has adopted a methodology consistent with ASU No. 2016-13 that requires that expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date that are accounted for at amortized cost be measured and recognized based on historical experience and current and reasonably supportable forecasted conditions to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses over the life of the loans at the measurement date. Further consideration is given to qualitative factors, including changes in current economic indicators and their probable impact on borrowers and collateral, trends in delinquent and non-performing loans, trends in criticized and classified assets, levels of exceptions, the impact of competition in the market, concentrations of credit risk in a variety of areas, including portfolio product mix, the level of loans to individual borrowers and their related interests, loans to industry segments and the geographic distribution of CRE loans. Management s estimates used in calculating the ACL may increase or decrease based on changes in these factors, which in turn will affect the amount of the Company s provision for credit losses charged against current period income. This evaluation is inherently subjective and actual results could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions. The Company estimates expected credit losses on OBS credit exposures over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The ACL on OBS credit exposures is recorded as a liability on the balance sheet within Accrued interest and other liabilities, with adjustments made through credit loss expense. A modified version of these requirements applies to debt securities classified as available-for-sale, which eliminates OTTI impairment analysis and requires that if a decline in the fair value of debt securities AFS is deemed by management to be the result of credit losses rather than other factors, the credit losses on those securities is recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than a write-down of the security. The Company s securities portfolio is evaluated for impairment on a quarterly basis. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Company s net income for the third quarter of 2024 was 3.1 million, or 0.55 per common share, compared to 3.4 million, or 0.61 per common share for the same quarter of 2023, and for the first nine months of 2024 was 8.7 million, or 1.55 per common share, compared to 9.9 million, or 1.80 per common share, for the same period in 2023. Core earnings (NII) were 8.7 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 8.4 million for the same period of 2023, and 25.1 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 25.2 million for the same period in 2023. Interest and fees on loans, the major component of interest income, increased 1.8 million, or 16.7 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter of 2023, and 6.2 million, or 20.4 , for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Interest paid on deposits, which is the major component of total interest expense, increased 1.2 million, or 47.0 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter of 2023 and increased 3.5 million, or 54.0 , year over year, driven primarily by the increases in the fed funds rate during 2022 and into the third quarter of 2023. A shift from lower yielding interest-bearing accounts and savings accounts to higher yielding money market and certificate of deposit accounts has contributed to the higher interest expense year over year. Interest on borrowed funds increased 482 thousand, or 71.3 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 and increased 2.4 million, or 254.3 , for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Market pressures on deposit rates along with an increased use of wholesale funding are driving up the Company s cost of funds and compressing the net interest margin and net interest spread. The FOMC s recent 50 bps decrease in the federal funds rate occurred late in the third quarter and did not reduce the Company s funding costs for the three- and nine-month periods of 2024. Return on average assets, which is net income divided by average total assets, measures how effectively a corporation uses its assets to produce earnings. Return on average equity, which is net income divided by average shareholders' equity, measures how effectively a corporation uses its equity capital to produce earnings. 32 Table of Contents The following table shows these ratios annualized, as well as other equity ratios monitored by management, for the comparison periods presented. Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Return on average assets 1.09 1.24 Return on average equity 13.13 16.48 Dividend payout ratio (1) 43.64 37.70 Average equity to average assets 8.32 7.55 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Return on average assets 1.04 1.27 Return on average equity 12.71 16.68 Dividend payout ratio (1) 45.16 38.33 Average equity to average assets 8.16 7.60 (1) Dividends declared per common share divided by earnings per common share. INTEREST INCOME VERSUS INTEREST EXPENSE (NET INTEREST INCOME) The largest component of the Company s operating income is NII, which is the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and other sources of funds (i.e., borrowings). The Company s level of net interest income can fluctuate over time due to changes in the level and mix of earning assets and sources of funds (volume), and changes in the yield earned and costs of funds (rate). A portion of the Company s income from loans to local municipalities and from tax-exempt municipal investment securities is not subject to income taxes. Because the proportion of tax-exempt items in the Company's balance sheet varies from year-to-year, to improve comparability of information, the non-taxable income shown in the tables below has been converted to a tax equivalent basis. The Company s corporate tax rate is 21 ; therefore, to equalize tax-free and taxable income in the comparison, we divide the tax-free income by 79 , with the result that every tax-free dollar is equivalent to 1.27 in taxable income for the periods presented. The Company s tax-exempt interest income of 762,126 and 559,985 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 2.0 million and 1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was derived from loans to local municipalities of 65.5 million and 58.7 million, and tax-exempt municipal investment securities of 10.5 million and 10.6 million as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The following table shows the reconciliation between reported NII and tax equivalent NII for the comparison periods presented.

(3) Net interest spread is the difference between the average yield on average interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on average interest-bearing liabilities. (4) Net interest margin is net interest income divided by average earning assets. 35 Table of Contents The average volume of interest-earning assets for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 increased 6.0 and 7.2 , respectively, compared to the same periods last year, and the average yield on interest-earning assets increased 46 bps in both comparison periods. The average volume of loans increased over the three- and nine-month comparison periods of 2024 versus 2023 by 8.4 and 11.7 , respectively, and the average yield on loans increased 44 bps and 43 bps, respectively. Loans accounted for 82.2 and 82.0 of the average interest-earning asset portfolio for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to 80.5 and 78.7 , respectively, for the same periods last year. Interest earned on the loan portfolio as a percentage of total interest income was 91.2 and 91.1 , respectively, for the three- and nine-month periods in 2024 compared to 90.3 and 88.9 , respectively, for the same periods in 2023. The average volume of the taxable investment portfolio (classified as AFS) decreased 8.2 and 6.1 , respectively, during the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods last year, while the average yield increased five bps and 11 bps, respectively, between periods. There were no purchases of taxable AFS investment securities during the first nine months of 2024, accounting for the decrease in average volume year over year. The average volume of the tax-exempt investment portfolio (classified as AFS) for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 decreased 0.6 in both periods, and the tax equivalent yield decreased nine bps and seven bps, respectively. There were no tax-exempt bond purchases during the first nine months of 2024, accounting for the decrease in average volume in this portfolio. The average volume of sweep and interest-earning accounts, which consists primarily of an interest-bearing account at the FRBB, increased 94.7 , but decreased 48.6 , respectively, for the three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease in average volume for the nine-month period year over year is attributable to the funding of loan growth, and to a decrease in customer deposit accounts. The average yield on these funds increased 48 bps and 76 bps, respectively, for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, versus the same periods in 2023, directly related to the increases in the fed funds rate throughout 2022 and into 2023. The average volume of interest-bearing liabilities for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 increased 8.5 and 10.3 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased 64 bps and 82 bps, respectively. The average volume of interest-bearing transaction accounts increased 5.2 and 2.5 , respectively, for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods of 2023, reflecting moderate growth year over year. The average rate paid on these accounts increased 32 bps and 34 bps, respectively, between comparison periods. Interest-bearing transaction accounts comprised 33.0 and 33.5 of the average interest-bearing liabilities portfolio for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to 34.0 and 36.0 , respectively, for the same periods last year. Interest paid on these funds accounted for 26.3 and 27.1 , respectively, of total interest expense for the three- and nine-month periods of 2024 compared to 30.5 and 36.8 , respectively, for the same periods in 2023. The average volume of money market accounts decreased 20.9 and 9.9 , respectively, for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, while the average rate paid on these deposits increased 22 bps and 50 bps, respectively. The average volume of savings accounts decreased 11.8 and 12.1 , respectively, for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, while the average rate paid on these accounts increased one bp in both comparison periods. The average volume of time deposits increased 52.0 and 39.1 , respectively, for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, and the average rate paid increased 156 bps and 172 bps, respectively. The average volume of repurchase agreements decreased 8.0 and 12.1 , respectively, for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, while the average rate paid increased 11 bps and 38 bps, respectively, between comparison periods. The Company has utilized borrowed funds to fund loan growth and cover deposit outflows, particularly during the second and third quarters of 2023, and continuing into 2024, accounting for the increases of 44.3 million and 67.6 million in the average volume of borrowed funds, respectively, for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. The average rate paid on borrowed funds decreased 30 bps for the three-month period but remained the same for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. 36 Table of Contents In summary, between the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the average yield on interest-earning assets increased 46 bps in both periods, and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased 64 bps and 82 bps, respectively. Net interest spread decreased 18 bps and 36 bps, respectively, for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 versus the same periods in 2023, and the net interest margin decreased eight bps and 22 bps, respectively, between comparison periods. The following table summarizes the variances in interest income and interest expense on a fully tax-equivalent basis for the interim periods presented for 2024 and 2023 resulting from volume changes in daily average assets and daily average liabilities and fluctuations in average rates earned and paid.

Although loan volume increased during the first nine months of 2024, a complex CRE project that closed during the first three months of 2023 generated approximately 126 thousand in documentation fees, accounting for some of the decrease in other income from loans for the nine-month period of 2024 versus 2023. Income from CFS Partners increased between periods due in part to an equity market rally during the first nine months of 2024 and successful retention in managed accounts. CFS Partners has a small portion of its equity capital invested in the stock market, and as a result is sensitive to general stock market conditions. Other miscellaneous income is made up of many individual line items that in the aggregate represent approximately 7 of total non-interest income. 38 Table of Contents Non-interest Expense The components of non-interest expense for the periods presented were as follows: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, Change September 30, Change 2024 2023 Expense Percent 2024 2023 Expense Percent Salaries and wages 2,358,000 2,164,760 193,240 8.93 7,104,000 6,718,280 385,720 5.74 Employee benefits 986,804 797,304 189,500 23.77 2,840,194 2,363,444 476,750 20.17 Occupancy expenses, net 683,980 662,277 21,703 3.28 2,100,714 2,133,492 (32,778 -1.54 Other expenses Charged-off checks 2,049 19,551 (17,502 -89.52 41,576 22,404 19,172 85.57 Service contracts - administrative 209,409 159,437 49,972 31.34 594,048 467,926 126,122 26.95 FDIC insurance 168,442 104,000 64,442 61.96 465,079 360,343 104,736 29.07 Collection non-accruing loan expense 103,775 25,500 78,275 306.96 242,275 61,500 180,775 293.94 Electronic banking expense 116,799 69,313 47,486 68.51 339,819 204,948 134,871 65.81 ATM fees 186,842 170,947 15,895 9.30 526,175 482,417 43,758 9.07 Other miscellaneous expenses 1,692,558 1,641,455 51,103 3.11 4,826,494 4,743,417 83,077 1.75 Total non-interest expense 6,508,658 5,814,544 694,114 11.94 19,080,374 17,558,171 1,522,203 8.67 Total non-interest expense increased 694,114, or 11.9 and 1.5 million, or 8.7 , respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, with significant changes noted in the following: The increases in salaries and wages during the three and nine month periods of 2024 reflect normal salary increases and new hires and promotions in the areas of operations and commercial lending in the latter part of 2023, although the amounts and percentages of such increases were moderated by the effect of several unfilled positions during the first part of 2024. The increase in employee benefits is attributable to an increase in health insurance claims year over year under the Company s self-insured health insurance plan. The decrease in occupancy expense year over year is due to a combination of lower building maintenance costs as more repairs are done by staff rather than relying on outside vendors, and the settlement of a flood insurance claim received in the first quarter of 2024 where the replacement value received exceeded the depreciated value of equipment, resulting in a capital gain on equipment. An increase in check fraud activity resulted in an increase in charged-off checks . The increase in service contracts - administrative is due to a combination of new contracts, an increase in transaction-based pricing for certain contracts, and contractual inflationary adjustment factors that are higher than historical increase adjustments. The increase in FDIC insurance is attributable in part to an increase in the assessment multiplier. Collection non-accruing loan expenses were higher year over year due primarily to an increase in legal fees and insurance expenses associated with a commercial property in the Company s non-accruing loan portfolio. The increase in electronic banking expense is attributable to an upgrade of the Company s electronic banking platform. ATM fees are transaction-based and reflect increased customer activity year over year, as well as annual contractual price adjustments. 39 Table of Contents APPLICABLE INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes decreased 138,765, or 19.2 for the third quarter of 2024 and 584,509, or 25.8 for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, which is consistent with the decrease in income before income taxes but is also partially attributable to an increase in tax-exempt income associated with municipal loans and investments and an increase in tax credits year over year. Tax credits related to low-income housing limited partnership investments amounted to 174,612 and 80,529 for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 523,836 and 241,587, respectively for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023. The Company s investment in two new limited partnerships were fully funded by year-end 2023 accounting for the increase in tax credits. Amortization expense related to limited partnership investments is included as a component of income tax expense and amounted to 149,202 and 67,128 for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively and 447,606 and 201,384, respectively, for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023. These investments provide tax benefits, including tax credits, and are designed to provide a targeted effective annual yield between 5 and 7 . CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION The following table reflects the composition of the Company's major categories of assets and liabilities as a percentage of total assets or liabilities and shareholders equity, as of the balance sheet dates: September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Assets Loans 912,716,917 77.53 845,429,854 76.90 AFS securities 170,477,527 14.48 190,706,019 17.35 Liabilities Demand deposits 202,741,979 17.22 202,969,957 18.46 Interest-bearing transaction accounts 296,865,607 25.22 297,030,893 27.02 Money market funds 111,117,868 9.44 121,375,419 11.04 Savings deposits 144,173,873 12.25 151,570,686 13.79 Time deposits 174,680,762 14.84 124,020,827 11.28 Overnight borrowings 0 0.00 9,000,000 0.82 Short-term advances 62,500,000 5.31 44,500,000 4.05 Long-term advances 31,100,000 2.64 1,100,000 0.10 The following table reflects the changes in the composition of the Company's major categories of assets and liabilities between the balance sheet dates, as disclosed in the table above: Volume Change Percentage Assets Loans 67,287,063 7.96 AFS securities (20,228,492 -10.61 Liabilities Demand deposits (227,978 -0.11 Interest-bearing transaction accounts (165,286 -0.06 Money market funds (10,257,551 -8.45 Savings deposits (7,396,813 -4.88 Time deposits 50,659,935 40.85 Overnight borrowings (9,000,000 -100.00 Short-term advances 18,000,000 40.45 Long-term advances 30,000,000 2727.27 The increase in the loan portfolio during the first nine months of 2024 was primarily attributable to increases in CRE loans, commercial industrial loans, municipal loans and residential real estate 1 st lien loans. 40 Table of Contents The decrease in the securities AFS portfolio at September 30, 2024 is attributable to the combined effect during the first nine months of the year of maturities amounting to 11.0 million and principal payments on MBS, ABS and CMO investments totaling 13.5 million, which was partially offset by a decrease of 4.4 million in unrealized losses, which is reflected in OCI. In management s view, the size of the AFS securities portfolio is appropriate and proportional to the overall asset base, as this portfolio serves a significant role in the Company s liquidity position. The decrease in money market funds was driven by a decrease of 9.1 million, or 9.3 , in retail money market funds and a decrease in municipal deposits of 1.4 million, or 14.3 . The decrease in savings deposits is primarily due to a shift of funds between savings and time deposits, resulting from customer response to periodic certificate of deposit specials that have been offered throughout 2024. The increase in time deposits is also due to an increase in brokered deposits, as the Company looks to alternate sources of funding to support loan growth. As a result of the fluctuation in aggregate deposits during 2024, in addition to utilizing brokered deposits the Company utilized funding lines of credit with the FHLBB and FRB, including long-term advances, as a supplemental funding source, accounting for the significant increase in these funds. UNINSURED DEPOSITS Estimated deposits in excess of the FDIC insurance level amounted to 219.3 million as of September 30, 2024 and 217.3 million at December 31, 2023. The estimated balance of 35.5 million of uninsured time deposits as of September 30, 2024 was made up of time CDs of 31.4 million and retirement accounts of 4.1 million. Increments of maturity of these time deposits are summarized as follows: 3 months or less 13,224,330 Over 3 through 6 months 13,961,310 Over 6 through 12 months 6,754,289 Over 12 months 1,565,244 Total 35,505,173 Interest Rate Risk and Asset and Liability Management - Management actively monitors and manages the Company s interest rate risk exposure and attempts to structure the balance sheet to maximize net interest income while controlling its exposure to interest rate risk. The Company's ALCO is made up of the Executive Officers and certain Vice Presidents of the Bank representing major business lines. The ALCO formulates strategies to manage interest rate risk by evaluating the impact on earnings and capital of such factors as current interest rate forecasts and economic indicators, potential changes in such forecasts and indicators, liquidity and various business strategies. The ALCO meets at least quarterly to review financial statements, liquidity levels, yields and spreads to better understand, measure, monitor and control the Company s interest rate risk. In the ALCO process, the committee members apply policy limits set forth in the Asset Liability, Liquidity and Investment policies approved and periodically reviewed by the Company s Board of Directors. The ALCO's methods for evaluating interest rate risk include an analysis of the effects of interest rate changes on net interest income and an analysis of the Company's interest rate sensitivity "gap", which provides a static analysis of the maturity and repricing characteristics of the entire balance sheet. The ALCO Policy also includes a contingency funding plan to help management prepare for unforeseen liquidity restrictions, including hypothetical severe liquidity crises. Interest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in market interest rates. As interest rates change, the interest income and expense streams associated with the Company s financial instruments also change, thereby impacting NII, the primary component of the Company s earnings. Fluctuations in interest rates can also have an impact on liquidity. The ALCO uses an outside consultant to perform rate shock simulations to the Company's net interest income, as well as a variety of other analyses. It is ALCO s function to provide the assumptions used in the modeling process. Assumptions used in prior period simulation models are regularly tested by comparing projected NII with actual NII. The ALCO utilizes the results of the simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of NII and liquidity to sustained interest rate changes. The simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities reflected on the Company s balance sheet. The model also simulates the balance sheet s sensitivity to a prolonged flat rate environment. All rate scenarios are simulated assuming a parallel shift of the yield curve; however further simulations are performed utilizing non-parallel changes in the yield curve, including an inverted yield curve. The results of this sensitivity analysis are compared to the ALCO policy limits which specify a maximum tolerance level for NII exposure over a 1-year horizon, assuming no balance sheet growth, given a 200 bp shift upward and a 100 bp shift downward in interest rates. Under the Company s interest rate sensitivity modeling, in a rising rate environment NII initially trends upward as the short-term asset base (cash and adjustable-rate loans) quickly cycle upward while the retail funding base (deposits) lags the market. If rates paid on deposits must be increased more and/or more quickly than projected due to competitive pressures, the expected benefit of rising rates would be reduced. In a falling rate environment, NII is expected to trend slightly downward compared with the current rate environment scenario for the first year of the simulation as asset yield erosion is not fully offset by decreasing funding costs. Thereafter, net interest income is projected to experience sustained downward pressure as funding costs reach their assumed floors and asset yields continue to reprice into the lower rate environment. The prolonged inverted yield curve and an increased need for higher cost funding has resulted in a more liability sensitive balance sheet because in the rising rate environment there may be an initial delay in relief from deposit pricing. 41 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the estimated impact on the Company's NII over a twelve-month period, assuming a gradual parallel shift of the yield curve beginning September 30, 2024: Rate Change Percent Change in NII Down 100 bps 0.2 Up 200 bps -3.6 The estimated amounts shown in the table above are within the ALCO Policy limits. However, those amounts do not represent a forecast and should not be relied upon as indicative of future results. The ALCO model also provides alternate scenarios including a sustained flat, or inverted yield curve. While assumptions used in the ALCO process, including the interest rate simulation analyses, are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions, and expected future conditions, the Company cannot provide any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions, including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding 12,887,000 in principal amount of Junior Subordinated Debentures due December 15, 2037, which bear interest at a quarterly floating rate equal to 3-month CME SOFR, as adjusted by a spread adjustment factor of 0.26161, plus 2.85 . The quarterly floating rate in effect on the debentures was 8.496 for the March 2024 payment, 8.441 for the June 2024 payment, and 8.451 for the September payment. Credit Risk - As a financial institution, one of the primary risks the Company manages is credit risk, the risk of loss stemming from borrowers failure to repay loans or inability to meet other contractual obligations. The Company s Board of Directors prescribes policies for managing credit risk, including Loan, Appraisal and Environmental policies. These policies are supplemented by comprehensive underwriting standards and procedures. The Company maintains a Credit Administration department whose function includes credit analysis and monitoring of and reporting on the status of the loan portfolio, including delinquent and non-performing loan trends. The Company also monitors concentration of credit risk in a variety of areas, including portfolio mix, the level of loans to individual borrowers and their related interests, loans to industry segments, and the geographic distribution of commercial real estate loans. Loans are reviewed periodically by an independent loan review firm to help ensure accuracy of the Company's internal risk ratings and compliance with various internal policies, procedures and regulatory guidance. Residential mortgage loans represented 27.3 of the Company s loan balances as of September 30, 2024, compared to 28.5 as of December 31, 2023. The Company maintains a residential mortgage loan portfolio of traditional mortgage products and does not offer higher risk loan products, such as option adjustable-rate mortgage products, high loan-to-value products, interest only mortgages, subprime loans and products with deeply discounted teaser rates. Residential mortgages with loan-to-value ratios exceeding 80 are generally covered by PMI. A 90 loan-to-value residential mortgage product without PMI is only available to borrowers with excellent credit and low debt-to-income ratios and has not been widely originated. As of September 30, 2024, junior lien home equity products made up 13.2 of the residential mortgage portfolio with maximum loan-to-value ratios (including prior liens) of 80 . The Company also originates some home equity loans with loan-to-value ratios greater than 80 under an insured loan program with stringent underwriting criteria. 42 Table of Contents The following tables show the estimated maturity of the Company s loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024.

The commercial lending portfolio consists of commercial industrial, purchased, CRE and municipal loans, which collectively comprised 72.4 of the Company s loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024, compared to 71.2 as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the largest components of the CRE portfolio were 124.6 million in owner-occupied CRE and 154.3 million in non-owner occupied CRE. Risk in the Company s commercial industrial and CRE loan portfolios is mitigated in part by government guarantees issued by federal agencies such as the SBA and RD. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 20.2 million in guaranteed loans with guaranteed balances of 12.7 million, compared to 26.5 million in guaranteed loans with guaranteed balances of 17.6 million as of December 31, 2023. PPP loans with outstanding balances of 54 thousand as of September 30, 2024, and 84 thousand as of December 31, 2023, are included in these totals, all of which carry a 100 guarantee through the SBA, subject to borrower eligibility requirements. The Company works actively with customers early in the delinquency process to help them to avoid default and foreclosure. Commercial industrial and CRE loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is deterioration in the financial position of the borrower, payment in full of principal and interest is not expected, and/or principal or interest has been in default for 90 days or more. However, such a loan need not be placed on non-accrual status if it is both well secured and in the process of collection. Residential mortgages and home equity loans are considered for non-accrual status at 90 days past due and are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The Company obtains current property appraisals or market value analyses and considers the cost of carrying and selling collateral in order to assess the level of specific allocations required. Consumer loans are generally not placed in non-accrual but are charged off by the time they reach 120 days past due. When a loan is placed in non-accrual status, the Company reverses the accrued interest against current period income and discontinues the accrual of interest until the borrower clearly demonstrates the ability and intention to resume normal payments, typically demonstrated by regular timely payments for a period of not less than six months. Interest payments received on non-accrual or impaired loans are generally applied as a reduction of the loan book balance. 43 Table of Contents Credit loss expense The credit loss expense was made up of the following components for the periods indicated: Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Credit loss expense - loans 406,955 264,009 142,946 54.14 Credit loss expense (reversal) - OBS credit exposure 53,790 (23,120 76,910 -332.66 Credit loss expense 460,745 240,889 219,856 91.27 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Credit loss expense loans 1,076,676 849,549 227,127 26.74 Credit loss expense (reversal) - OBS credit exposure 29,230 (40,992 70,222 -171.31 Credit loss expense 1,105,906 808,557 297,349 36.78 The increases in the credit loss expense on loans in both comparison periods of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, was due in part to an increase in charge-offs as well as an increase in the volume of the loan portfolio. The increases in the OBS credit exposure during both the three-month and nine-month comparison periods are attributable to increases in unfunded loan commitments under contract. ACL and provisions Effective January 1, 2023, the Company was required to recognize credit losses under the guidance of ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, rather than under the incurred loss model. The guidance, which is referred to as the current expected credit loss, or CECL model, requires that expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date that are accounted for at amortized cost be measured and recognized based on historical experience and current and reasonably supportable forecasted conditions to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses over the life of the loans. The adjustment from the adoption of CECL in 2023 amounted to 549,113, net of tax and was recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings, which affected calculation of regulatory capital ratios. Changes in forecasts used in the CECL model could produce different results, quarter to quarter. The Company s ACL policy provides guidance in maintaining an adequate methodology for establishing, estimating, and maintaining allowances for credit losses under ASC 326. The policy creates a measurement model to establish a proper ACL based on current expected credit losses rather than incurred losses. The Company maintains an ACL at a level that management believes is appropriate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the measurement date (See Note 5 of the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements). Although the Company, in establishing the ACL, considers the expected inherent losses in individual loans and pools of loans, the ACL is a general reserve available to absorb all credit losses in the loan portfolio. No part of the ACL is segregated to absorb losses from any loan or segment of loans. When establishing the ACL each quarter, the Company applies a combination of significant key assumptions and methodologies, as discussed in the ACL section under Critical Accounting Policies in this MD A and presented in Note 5 of the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements. 44 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the Company s credit risk ratios for the balance sheet dates presented: September 30, December 31, 2024 2023 ACL to total loans outstanding 1.05 1.16 ACL 9,540,452 9,842,725 Loans outstanding 912,716,917 845,429,854 Non-accruing loans to loans outstanding 0.49 0.82 Non-accruing loans 4,486,341 6,955,046 Loans outstanding 912,716,917 845,429,854 ACL to non-accruing loans 212.66 141.52 ACL 9,540,452 9,842,725 Non-accruing loans 4,486,341 6,955,046 The following table shows the breakdown of the ACL by loan segment and the percentage of loans in each category to total loans in the respective portfolios at the date indicated: September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Amount Percent Amount Percent Commercial industrial 1,003,908 13.89 1,100,688 14.40 Purchased 25,617 0.92 37,065 1.25 Commercial real estate 5,565,611 50.41 5,522,082 49.07 Municipal 163,758 7.18 136,167 6.44 Residential real estate - 1st lien 2,398,677 23.66 2,590,926 24.70 Residential real estate - Jr lien 360,852 3.61 431,007 3.75 Consumer 22,029 0.33 24,790 0.39 Total 9,540,452 100.00 9,842,725 100.00 The third quarter ACL analysis indicated that the reserve balance of 9.5 million as of September 30, 2024, is sufficient to cover expected credit losses that are probable and estimable as of the measurement date. Included in the ACL calculation for September 30, 2024, is the completion of a workout of a commercial loan that was in non-accrual status which required a write down of approximately 1.0 million, which is also reflected in the net charge-offs and recoveries table on the next page. Also included in the ACL calculation are adjustments to several qualitative factors made by management during the third quarter of 2024, including a decrease to the qualitative factors for economic trends in all portfolios to reflect an improving economic environment. The qualitative factors for volume and terms in the commercial and industrial, CRE, and residential portfolios were decreased to reflect the absence of new or changed risks in those portfolios from new or increasing types of loans, industries, or collateral. The qualitative factors for concentrations in the commercial and industrial, CRE, and residential portfolios were decreased to reflect concentrations that are within policy as well adjust to the appropriate level for the residential portfolios where the concentration policy does not apply. The qualitative factor for delinquencies and non-performing loans in the consumer and residential portfolios was decreased to reflect low past due levels and a decrease year to date. Management believes that the quantitative calculation adequately captures the risk in these areas, and that the reserve balance continues to be directionally consistent with the overall risk profile of the Company s loan portfolio and credit risk appetite. While the ACL is described as consisting of separate allocated portions, the entire ACL is available to support loan losses, regardless of category. Management s assessment of the adequacy of the ACL is presented to the full Board for approval quarterly. 45 Table of Contents Net (charge-offs) recoveries during the periods presented to average loans outstanding were as follows: For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Commercial industrial -0.95 -0.29 Net charge-offs during the period (1,203,641 (357,643 Average amount outstanding 126,240,870 121,805,882 Purchased 0.00 0.00 Net charge-offs during the period 0 0 Average amount outstanding 9,521,419 6,503,285 Commercial real estate -0.03 0.01 Net (charge-offs) recoveries during the period (126,393 22,058 Average amount outstanding 433,341,367 376,591,108 Municipal 0.00 0.00 Net charge-offs during the period 0 0 Average amount outstanding 59,218,512 42,203,207 Residential real estate - 1st lien 0.00 0.04 Net recoveries during the period 0 72,588 Average amount outstanding 210,534,364 199,778,580 Residential real estate - Jr lien 0.05 0.09 Net recoveries during the period 15,537 28,015 Average amount outstanding 31,908,746 32,110,911 Consumer -2.02 -2.16 Net charge-offs during the period (64,452 (79,195 Average amount outstanding 3,192,650 3,674,543 Total loans -0.16 -0.04 Net charge-offs during the period (1,378,949 (314,177 Average amount outstanding 873,957,928 782,667,516 In addition to credit risk in the Company s loan and investment portfolios and its off-balance sheet commitments, and liquidity risk in its loan and deposit-taking operations, the Company s business activities also generate market risk. Market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. Declining capital markets and changes in interest rates can result in fair value adjustments to asset valuations or the need to create a related reserve or allowance. The Company does not have any market risk sensitive instruments acquired for trading purposes. The Company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending, deposit taking and investment activities. During recessionary periods, a declining housing market can result in an increase in loan loss reserves or ultimately an increase in foreclosures. Interest rate risk is directly related to the different maturities and repricing characteristics of interest-bearing assets and liabilities, as well as to loan prepayment risks, early withdrawal of time deposits, and the fact that the speed and magnitude of responses to interest rate changes vary by product. Rapid changes in prevailing interest rates, particularly after a long period of relative stability, create a challenging interest rate environment. As discussed above under "Interest Rate Risk and Asset and Liability Management", the Company actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk through the ALCO process. 46 Table of Contents COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company is a party to financial instruments with OBS risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and risk-sharing commitments on certain sold loans. Such instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. The contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the Company has in particular classes of financial instruments. During the first nine months of 2024, the Company did not engage in any activity that created any additional types of OBS risk. With the adoption of ASU 2016-13 (CECL), the Company is required to establish an allowance for expected credit losses on OBS credit exposures. Expected credit losses are estimated by management over the contractual period during which the Company is exposed to credit risk under a contractual obligation to extend credit unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over the estimated lives of such commitments. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-13 in 2023, the Company recorded a negative adjustment to retained earnings of 451,704 to reflect an allowance for credit losses for unfunded commitments. The allowance for credit losses for OBS credit exposures is presented in the "Accrued interest and other liabilities" line of the consolidated balance sheets. There was an increase of 53,790 and a decrease of 23,120, respectively, to the allowance for credit losses for OBS credit exposures during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and an increase of 29,230 and a decrease of 40,992, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Managing liquidity risk is essential to maintaining both depositor confidence and stability in earnings. Liquidity management refers to the ability of the Company to adequately cover fluctuations in assets and liabilities. Meeting loan demand (assets) and covering the withdrawal of deposit funds (liabilities) are two key components of the liquidity management process. The Company s principal sources of funds are deposits, amortization and prepayment of loans and securities, maturities of investment securities, sales of loans available-for-sale, and earnings and funds provided from operations. These sources are supplemented by short-term and long-term borrowings as needed. Maintaining a relatively stable funding base, which is achieved by diversifying funding sources, competitively pricing deposit products, and extending the contractual maturity of liabilities, reduces the Company s exposure to rollover risk on deposits and limits reliance on volatile short-term borrowed funds. Short-term funding needs arise from declines in deposits or other funding sources and from funding requirements for loan commitments. The Company s strategy is to fund assets to the maximum extent possible with core deposits that provide a sizable source of relatively stable and lower-cost funds. The Company recognizes that, at times, when loan demand exceeds deposit growth or the Company has other liquidity demands, or when the Company experiences deposit outflows; it may be desirable to utilize alternative sources of deposit funding to augment retail deposits and borrowings. One-way deposits acquired through the CDARS and/or ICS programs provide an alternative funding source when needed. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had 0.5 million and 0, respectively, in one-way CDARS deposits, and no one-way ICS deposits outstanding at either period end. In addition, two-way (reciprocal) CDARS deposits, as well as reciprocal ICS money market and demand deposits, enhance the Company s ability to retain larger deposit balances by allowing the Company to provide FDIC deposit insurance to its customers in excess of account coverage limits through the exchange of deposits with other participating FDIC-insured financial institutions. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company reported 2.5 million and 2.4 million, respectively, in reciprocal CDARS deposits. The balance in ICS reciprocal money market deposits was 22.8 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 13.2 million as of December 31, 2023, and the balance in ICS reciprocal demand deposits as of those dates was 95.0 million and 87.1 million, respectively. Additionally, the Company had brokered deposits from another source totaling approximately 13.9 million as of September 30, 2024 and 0 at December 31, 2023. This relationship has provided increased access to short-term funding that is easily accessible without any detrimental effect on the pricing of the core deposit base. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, borrowing capacity of 110.0 million and 107.9 million, respectively, was available through the FHLBB, secured by the Company's qualifying loan portfolio (generally, residential mortgage and commercial loans), reduced by outstanding advances and by collateral pledges securing FHLBB letters of credit collateralizing public unit deposits in the aggregate amount of 150 thousand and 23.1 million, respectively. 47 Table of Contents The following table reflects the Company s outstanding advances with FHLBB as of the dates indicated: September 30, December 31, 2024 2023 FHLBB Short-Term Advances FHLBB term advance, 5.06 , due October 29, 2024 5,000,000 0 FHLBB Long-Term Advances FHLBB term advance, 0.00 , due November 12, 2025 (1) 300,000 300,000 FHLBB term advance, 0.00 , due November 13, 2028 (1) 800,000 800,000 FHLBB option advance, 4.54 , due May 15, 2026 10,000,000 0 FHLBB option advance, 4.74 , due May 26, 2026 5,000,000 0 FHLBB option advance, 3.89 , due February 01, 2027 5,000,000 0 FHLBB option advance, 4.27 , due June 07, 2027 10,000,000 0 Total Long-Term Advances 31,100,000 1,100,000 Overnight Borrowings at 5.54 0 9,000,000 Total Advances and Overnight Borrowings 36,100,000 10,100,000 (1) Under the JNE program, the FHLBB provides a subsidy, funded by the FHLBB s earnings, to write down interest rates to zero percent on advances that finance qualifying loans to small businesses. JNE advances must support small business in New England that create and/or retain jobs, or otherwise contribute to overall economic development activities. The Company utilized borrowing capacity during 2023 and the first quarter of 2024 under the BTFP, a temporary loan facility established by the FRB in March 2023 to provide additional liquidity to financial institutions in the wake of several high-profile bank failures. The Company s BTFP borrowings are collateralized by U.S. Agency and U.S. Government Securities, valued at par. The BTFP ceased extending new loans on March 11, 2024. The Company s advances under the BTFP as of the balance sheet dates were as follows: September 30, December 31, 2024 2023 FRB BTFP Advances FRB BTFP term advance, 4.92 , due April 26, 2024 0 10,000,000 FRB BTFP term advance, 4.71 , due May 13, 2024 0 10,000,000 FRB BTFP term advance, 4.91 , due May 17, 2024 0 6,500,000 FRB BTFP term advance, 4.93 , due December 16, 2024 0 18,000,000 FRB BTFP term advance, 4.76 , due January 16, 2025 16,000,000 0 FRB BTFP term advance, 4.83 , due January 17, 2025 41,500,000 0 Total BTFP Advances 57,500,000 44,500,000 The Company also has an unsecured Federal Funds credit line with the FHLBB with an available balance of 500,000 with no outstanding advances during either of the respective comparison periods. Interest is chargeable at a rate determined daily, approximately 25 bps higher than the rate paid on federal funds sold. The Company has a BIC arrangement with the FRBB secured by eligible commercial industrial loans, CRE loans and home equity loans, resulting in an available credit line of 61.2 million and 49.9 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Credit advances under this FRBB lending program are overnight advances with interest chargeable at the primary credit rate (generally referred to as the discount rate), currently 500 bps. The Company had no outstanding advances through this facility as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the Company had an unsecured line of credit of 12.5 million with one correspondent bank. The Company had no outstanding advances against this credit line as of the balance sheet dates. 48 Table of Contents Management believes that the combination of high levels of potentially liquid assets, unencumbered securities, cash flows from operations, and additional borrowing capacity are sufficient to meet the Company s liquidity and capital needs. The following table illustrates the changes in shareholders' equity from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024: Balance as of December 31, 2023 (book value 15.87 per common share) 89,028,814 Net income 8,665,338 Issuance of common stock through the DRIP 1,058,472 Dividends declared on common stock (3,819,358 Dividends declared on preferred stock (95,625 Change in AOCI on AFS securities, net of tax 3,510,814 Balance as of September 30, 2024 (book value 17.36 per common share) 98,348,455 The primary objective of the Company s capital planning process is to balance appropriately the retention of capital to support operations and future growth, with the goal of providing shareholders with an attractive return on their investment, while at the same time satisfying all regulatory capital requirements. To that end, management strives to deploy capital efficiently and monitors capital retention and dividend policies on an ongoing basis. Consistent with these capital planning considerations, During the third quarter of 2024, the Company adopted a stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to 275,000 shares of the Company s common stock, representing approximately 5 of the outstanding common shares. Purchases under the program may be on such terms, including price, as market conditions warrant, and may be made through open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase authorization expires in five years, unless extended, or earlier terminated, by the Board. Notwithstanding the program s five-year term, the Board will review and re-evaluate the program annually in light of the Company s then current capital needs, the number and cost of shares repurchased, the number of shares remaining for repurchase under the authorization, and other relevant factors, and management will confer with the FRBB regarding the program, as appropriate in the circumstances. As described in more detail in Note 22 to the audited consolidated financial statements contained in the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and under the caption LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES in the MD A section of that report, the Company (on a consolidated basis) and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies pursuant to which they must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank was considered well capitalized under the standard regulatory capital framework for Prompt Corrective Action and the Company exceeded currently applicable consolidated regulatory guidelines for capital adequacy. 49 Table of Contents The following table shows the Company s actual capital ratios and those of its subsidiary, as well as currently applicable regulatory capital requirements, as of the balance sheet date: Minimum Minimum Minimum For Capital To Be Well For Capital Adequacy Purposes Capitalized Under Adequacy with Conservation Prompt Corrective Actual Purposes Buffer (1) Action Provisions (2) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio (Dollars in Thousands) September 30, 2024 Common equity tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) Company 97,695 11.86 37,063 4.50 57,653 7.00 N/A N/A Bank 111,237 13.52 37,034 4.50 57,609 7.00 53,494 6.50 Tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) Company 112,082 13.61 49,417 6.00 70,007 8.50 N/A N/A Bank 111,237 13.52 49,379 6.00 69,953 8.50 65,839 8.00 Total capital (to risk-weighted assets) Company 122,378 14.86 65,889 8.00 86,480 10.50 N/A N/A Bank 121,525 14.77 65,839 8.00 86,413 10.50 82,298 10.00 Tier 1 capital (to average assets) Company 112,082 9.85 45,507 4.00 N/A N/A N/A N/A Bank 111,237 9.78 45,485 4.00 N/A N/A 56,856 5.00 December 31, 2023: Common equity tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) Company 91,886 11.89 34,770 4.50 54,086 7.00 N/A N/A Bank 105,390 13.65 34,737 4.50 54,036 7.00 50,176 6.50 Tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) Company 106,273 13.75 46,360 6.00 65,676 8.50 N/A N/A Bank 105,390 13.65 46,317 6.00 65,615 8.50 61,755 8.00 Total capital (to risk-weighted assets) Company 115,944 15.01 61,813 8.00 81,130 10.50 N/A N/A Bank 115,051 14.90 61,755 8.00 81,054 10.50 77,194 10.00 Tier 1 capital (to average assets) Company 106,273 9.57 44,401 4.00 N/A N/A N/A N/A Bank 105,390 9.50 44,376 4.00 N/A N/A 55,470 5.00 (1) Conservation Buffer is calculated based on risk-weighted assets and does not apply to calculations of average assets. (2) Applicable to banks, but not bank holding companies. The Company's ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is largely dependent on the Bank's ability to pay dividends to the Company. In general, a national bank may not pay dividends that exceed net income for the current and preceding two years. Regardless of statutory restrictions, as a matter of regulatory policy, banks and bank holding companies should pay dividends only out of current earnings and only if, after paying such dividends, they remain adequately capitalized. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 3.

For this purpose, the term disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of the Company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by it in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 51 Table of Contents PART II.
