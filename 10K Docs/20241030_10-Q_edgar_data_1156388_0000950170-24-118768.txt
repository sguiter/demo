A substantial amount of the Company s inventory is manufactured abroad and, from time to time, shipping ports may experience capacity constraints (such as delays associated with the novel coronavirus COVID-19 ), labor strikes, work stoppages or other disruptions that may delay the delivery of imported products. A contract dispute may lead to protracted delays in the movement of the Company s products, which could further delay the delivery of products to the Company s stores and impact net sales and profitability. In addition, other conditions outside of the Company s control, such as adverse weather conditions or acts of terrorism or war, such as the current conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, could significantly disrupt operations at shipping ports or otherwise impact transportation of the imported merchandise we sell, either through supply chain disruptions, or rising freight and fuel costs.

Substantially all of the Company s revenue is for single performance obligations for the following distinct items: Retail store sales 

 E-commerce sales 

 Stored-value cards 

 For performance obligations related to retail store and e-commerce sales contracts, the Company typically transfers control, for retail stores, upon consummation of the sale when the product is paid for and taken by the customer and, for e-commerce sales, when the product is tendered for delivery to the common carrier. For performance obligations related to stored-value cards, the Company typically transfers control upon redemption of the stored-value card through consummation of a future sales transaction. The Company accounts for shipping and handling relative to e-commerce sales as fulfillment activities, and not a separate performance obligation. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue for only performance obligation, the sale of the product, at shipping point (when the customer gains control). Revenue associated with e-commerce sales was not material for the 13 and 39 weeks ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023. The Company recognized million and million in stored-value card redemption revenue for the 13 and 39 weeks ended September 29, 2024 , respectively, compared to million and million in stored-value card redemption revenue for the 13 and 39 weeks ended October 1, 2023, respectively.

The Loan Agreement has a maturity date of and provides for a revolving credit facility with an aggregate committed availability of up to million. The Company may also request additional increases in aggregate availability, up to a maximum of million, in which case the existing lender under the Loan Agreement will have the option to increase the commitment to accommodate the requested increase. If such existing lender does not exercise that option, the Company may (with the consent of BofA in its role as the administrative agent, not to be unreasonably withheld) seek other lenders willing to provide such commitments. The credit facility includes a million sublimit for issuances of letters of credit. The Company may borrow under the Loan Agreement from time to time, provided the amounts outstanding will not exceed the lesser of the then aggregate committed availability (as discussed above) and the Borrowing Base (such lesser amount being referred to as the Line Cap ). As defined in the Loan Agreement, the Borrowing Base generally is comprised of the sum, at the time of calculation, of (a) of eligible credit card receivables; plus (b) the cost of eligible inventory (other than eligible in-transit inventory), net of inventory reserves, multiplied by of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory (expressed as a percentage of the cost of eligible inventory); plus (c) the cost of eligible in-transit inventory, net of inventory reserves, multiplied by of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible in-transit inventory (expressed as a percentage of the cost of eligible in-transit inventory), minus (d) certain agreed-upon reserves as well as other reserves established by BofA in its role as the administrative agent in its reasonable discretion. Generally, the Company may designate specific borrowings under the Loan Agreement as either base rate loans or Term SOFR rate loans. The applicable interest rate on the Company s borrowings is a function of the daily average, over the preceding fiscal quarter, of the excess of the Line Cap over amounts borrowed (such amount being referred to as the Average Daily Availability ). Those loans designated as Term SOFR rate loans bear interest at a rate equal to the then applicable secured overnight financing rate as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York SOFR rate plus a SOFR adjustment spread, plus an applicable margin as shown in the table below. Those loans designated as base rate loans bear interest at a rate equal to ), (b) the one-month SOFR rate, plus one percentage point ), or (c) the rate of interest in effect for such day as announced from time to time within BofA as its prime rate. The applicable margin for all loans is a function of Average Daily Availability for the preceding fiscal quarter as set forth in the following table.

While further recovery is expected in fiscal 2024, recoveries were received in the first nine months of fiscal 2024. Legal Proceedings On March 13, 2023, a complaint was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara, entitled Zareyah Thompson v. Big 5 Corp., et. al., Case No. 23CV412334 Thompson Complaint ). The Thompson Complaint was brought as a purported California Private Attorneys General Act PAGA action on behalf of current and former employees who worked for the Company or its operating subsidiary in California as a non-exempt, hourly paid employee and received at least one wage statement. The Thompson Complaint alleges, among other things, that Big 5 failed to (i) provide minimum wages, (ii) provide compliant meal or rest periods, (iii) maintain and provide accurate itemized wage statements, (iv) properly compensate for all time worked, including overtime, premium, vacation and final wages, (v) properly maintain payroll records, and (vi) provide suitable seating. On March 21, 2023, a second complaint was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara, entitled Christopher Puga v. Big 5 Corp., et. al., Case No. 23CV412953 Puga Complaint ). The Puga Complaint was brought as a purported PAGA action on behalf of all current and former non-exempt employees that worked either directly or via a staffing agency for the Company or its operating subsidiary at any location in California Putative Covered Employees ). The Puga Complaint alleges, among other things, that Big 5 (i) unlawfully required Putative Covered Employees to agree to unlawful criminal background checks, (ii) conducted unlawful financial and criminal background checks, and did not (iii) provide minimum wages, (iv) provide accurate itemized wage statements, (v) maintain accurate records pertaining to the Putative Covered Employees employment, (vi) produce or make available Putative Covered Employees personnel records and/or payroll records, (vii) provide compliant meal or rest periods, (viii) properly compensate for all time worked, including overtime, premium, vacation, and final wages, (ix) reimburse necessary business expenses; (x) provide suitable seating; (xi) provide sick leave pay to Putative Covered Employees, (xii) accurately calculate sick leave accrual and rate of pay, (xiii) put the Putative Covered Employees on notice of their paid sick leave rights, and (xiv) provide supplemental paid sick leave. The Thompson and Puga complaints have many overlapping causes of action. Accordingly, on or about April 12, 2023, a notice of related cases was filed with the Court regarding the Thompson Complaint and Puga Complaint. The Court subsequently conducted a case management conference on June 29, 2023 for both complaints, and jointly coordinated the complaints. The Company s counsel held a mediation with opposing counsel on September 27, 2023. The Company has reached a settlement in both cases and established a cumulative indemnity reserve of million. The settlement has been approved by the Court and the Company deposited the settlement funds with the settlement administrator on October 4, 2024. The Company is involved in various other claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of the Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation we, our, us financial condition and results of operations includes information with respect to our plans and strategies for our business and should be read in conjunction with our interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes Interim Financial Statements included herein, the Risk Factors included herein and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), and our consolidated financial statements, related notes, Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest December 31. Fiscal 2024 is comprised of 52 weeks and ends on December 29, 2024. Fiscal 2023 was comprised of 52 weeks and ended on December 31, 2023. The interim periods in fiscal 2024 and 2023 are each comprised of 13 weeks. 
 Overview 
 We are a leading sporting goods retailer in the western United States, with 424 stores and an e-commerce platform under the name Big 5 Sporting Goods as of September 29, 2024. We provide a full-line product offering in a traditional sporting goods store format that averages approximately 12,000 square feet. Our product mix includes athletic shoes, apparel and accessories, as well as a broad selection of outdoor and athletic equipment for team sports, fitness, camping, hunting, fishing, home recreation, tennis, golf, and winter and summer recreation. 
 In the first nine months of fiscal 2024 we opened two new stores and closed eight stores and in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 we opened two new stores and closed four stores, one of which was a relocation. For fiscal 2024, we anticipate opening approximately three new stores and closing approximately eleven stores. 
 Executive Summary 
 Our net loss in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with net income in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and reflected the impact of reduced net sales, lower merchandise margins and the establishment of a valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets. The decrease in net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 in part reflected significant and persistent inflationary pressures which continued to dampen consumer sentiment and reduce demand for discretionary products, combined with reduced stores in operation. 
 Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased 8.0 to 220.6 million compared to 239.9 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The decrease in net sales primarily reflects a decline of 7.5 in same store sales when compared with the third quarter of the prior year. Our lower same store sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 in part reflected significant and persistent inflationary pressures that continued to negatively impact consumer demand. 

Gross profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 represented 29.1 of net sales, compared with 33.2 in the third quarter of the prior year, and reflected lower merchandise margins, as well as higher store occupancy expense and distribution expense, including costs capitalized into inventory, as a percentage of net sales. 

Selling and administrative expense for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased to 75.0 million, or 34.0 of net sales, compared to 76.6 million, or 31.9 of net sales, for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily reflecting decreases in legal expense and company performance-based incentive accruals. 

Net loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was 29.9 million, or 1.36 per basic share, compared to net income of 1.9 million, or 0.08 per diluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Net loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 primarily reflects the establishment of a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets of 21.8 million, or 0.99 per basic share. 

Operating cash flow for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was a positive 9.1 million compared to operating cash flow in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 of a positive 21.1 million. 

Capital expenditures for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and 2023 were 8.9 million and 8.2 million, respectively. We expect to open approximately three new stores in fiscal 2024, after opening two new stores in the prior year. 

We had cash of 4.0 million and 17.9 million as of September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, respectively. We had no borrowings under our credit facility as of September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023. 

We paid cash dividends in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 of 2.8 million, or 0.10 per share, compared with 17.0 million, or 0.75 per share, in the first nine months of fiscal 2023.

(1) Cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise, net of discounts or allowances earned, freight, inventory reserves, buying, distribution center expense, including depreciation and amortization, and store occupancy expense. Store occupancy expense includes rent, amortization of leasehold improvements, common area maintenance, property taxes and insurance.

Net Sales . Net sales decreased by 19.3 million, or 8.0 , to 220.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 from 239.9 million in the third quarter last year. The change in net sales reflected the following: 
 Same store sales decreased by 17.5 million, or 7.5 , for the 13 weeks ended September 29, 2024, versus the comparable 13-week period in the prior year. The decline in same store sales was attributed to the following: 

o The decrease in same store sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 continued to, in part, reflect significant and persistent inflationary pressures that dampened consumer sentiment and weakened discretionary spending, which contributed to reduced net sales. 

o Our lower same store sales reflected decreases in our major merchandise categories of footwear, apparel and hardgoods. 

o Same store sales comparisons are made on a comparable-day basis. Same store sales for a period normally consist of sales for stores that operated throughout the period and the full corresponding prior-year period, along with sales from e-commerce. Sales from e-commerce in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 2023 were not material. 

Net sales decreases reflected reduced stores in operation, with 424 stores in operation as of September 29, 2024 compared to 430 stores in operation as of October 1, 2023. 

We experienced decreased customer transactions of 5.2 and a lower average sale per transaction of 2.3 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year. 

Gross Profit . Gross profit decreased by 15.4 million to 64.2 million, or 29.1 of net sales, in the 13 weeks ended September 29, 2024, compared with 79.6 million, or 33.2 of net sales, in the 13 weeks ended October 1, 2023. The change in gross profit was primarily attributable to the following: 
 Net sales decreased by 19.3 million, or an unfavorable 8.0 , compared with the third quarter of last year. 

Merchandise margins, which exclude buying, occupancy and distribution expense, decreased by an unfavorable 119 basis points compared with the third quarter of last year, primarily reflecting increased promotions, higher clearance sales and shifts in sales mix. 

Store occupancy expense increased by 2.0 million, or an unfavorable 177 basis points as a percentage of net sales, compared with the third quarter of last year. 

- 22 - 

Distribution expense, including costs capitalized into inventory, increased by 0.9 million, or an unfavorable 99 basis points as a percentage of net sales, in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year. The increase primarily reflected increased trucking expense and decreased costs capitalized into inventory, partially offset by lower fuel expense and employee labor and benefit-related expense. 

Selling and Administrative Expense . Selling and administrative expense decreased by 1.6 million to 75.0 million, or 34.0 of net sales, in the 13 weeks ended September 29, 2024, compared to 76.6 million, or 31.9 of net sales, in the third quarter of last year. The change in selling and administrative expense was primarily attributable to the following: 
 Administrative expense decreased by 2.1 million, primarily attributable to year-over-year decreases in legal expense and company performance-based incentive accruals, partially offset by a non-cash impairment charge of 0.7 million related to an underperforming store. 

Store-related expense, excluding occupancy, increased by 0.6 million due primarily to increases in utility expense and employee benefit-related expense, partially offset by decreases in employee labor expense and credit card fees related to lower sales. While employee labor expense decreased by 0.5 million mainly as a result of managing employee labor hours in light of reduced sales, this reduction was partially offset by continuing wage rate pressures that included the incremental impact of legislated minimum wage rate increases primarily in California, where over half of our stores are located, as well as higher demand for labor in certain markets resulting in higher wage rates. Our year-over-year store-related expense comparisons also reflected reduced stores in operation, which declined to 424 stores at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024 from 430 stores at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023. 

Our advertising expense was flat in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 when compared with the prior year and remains less than half of our pre-pandemic expense level. We expect our expense to continue to benefit from reduced advertising activity in the foreseeable future. 

Interest Expense (Income) . Interest expense increased by 0.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023 due primarily to higher year-over-year finance lease interest expense as a result of rising interest rates and lower interest income earned on lower cash balances. 
 Income Tax Expense . The provision for income taxes was 18.9 million and 1.2 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. The provision for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 reflected the establishment of a valuation allowance of 21.8 million established against the net amount of deferred tax assets as well as a pre-tax loss in the current year. See Note 8 to the Interim Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a further discussion of our evaluation of deferred tax assets.

Net Sales . Net sales decreased by 74.6 million, or 10.8 , to 613.8 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 from 688.4 million in the first nine months of last year. The change in net sales reflected the following: 
 Same store sales decreased by 68.9 million, or 10.2 , for the 39 weeks ended September 29, 2024, versus the comparable 39-week period in the prior year. The decline in same store sales was attributed to the following: 

o The decrease in same store sales in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 continued, in part, to reflect significant and persistent inflationary pressures that dampened consumer sentiment and weakened discretionary spending, which contributed to reduced net sales. 

o Our lower same store sales reflected decreases in our major merchandise categories of apparel, hardgoods and footwear. 

o Same store sales comparisons are made on a comparable-day basis. Same store sales for a period normally consist of sales for stores that operated throughout the period and the full corresponding prior-year period, along with sales from e-commerce. Sales from e-commerce in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and 2023 were not material. 

Net sales decreases reflected reduced stores in operation, with 424 stores in operation as of September 29, 2024 compared to 430 stores in operation as of October 1, 2023. 

We experienced decreased customer transactions of 8.8 and a lower average sale per transaction of 1.4 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year. 

Gross Profit . Gross profit decreased by 43.3 million to 183.3 million, or 29.9 of net sales, in the 39 weeks ended September 29, 2024, compared with 226.6 million, or 32.9 of net sales, in the 39 weeks ended October 1, 2023. The change in gross profit was primarily attributable to the following: 
 Net sales decreased by 74.6 million, or an unfavorable 10.8 , compared with the first nine months of last year. 

Merchandise margins, which exclude buying, occupancy and distribution expense, decreased by an unfavorable 37 basis points compared with the first nine months of last year, primarily reflecting increased promotions, higher clearance sales and shifts in product mix. 

Store occupancy expense increased by 2.6 million, or an unfavorable 175 basis points as a percentage of net sales, compared with the first nine months of last year. 

Distribution expense, including costs capitalized into inventory, increased by 1.5 million, or an unfavorable 97 basis points as a percentage of net sales, in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year. The increase primarily reflected higher trucking expense and decreased costs capitalized into inventory, partially offset by lower employee labor and benefit-related expense and lower fuel expense. 

Selling and Administrative Expense . Selling and administrative expense decreased by 5.5 million to 218.6 million, or 35.6 of net sales, in the 39 weeks ended September 29, 2024, compared to 224.1 million, or 32.6 of net sales, in the first nine months of last year. The change in selling and administrative expense was primarily attributable to the following: 
 Administrative expense decreased by 3.0 million, primarily attributable to decreases in legal expense and company performance-based incentive accruals, partially offset by a non-cash impairment charge of 0.7 million related to an underperforming store. 

Store-related expense, excluding occupancy, decreased by 2.3 million due primarily to decreases in employee labor expense and credit card fees related to lower sales, partially offset by increases in employee benefit-related expense and higher utility expense. While employee labor expense decreased by 3.4 million mainly as a result of managing employee labor hours in light of reduced sales, this reduction was partially offset by continuing wage rate pressures that included the incremental impact of legislated minimum wage rate increases primarily in California, where over half of our stores are located, as well as higher demand for labor in certain markets resulting in higher wage rates. Our lower year-over-year store-related expense also reflected reduced stores in operation, which declined to 424 stores at the end of the first nine months of fiscal 2024 from 430 stores at the end of the first nine months of fiscal 2023. 

Our advertising expense decreased by 0.2 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and remains less than half of our pre-pandemic expense level. We expect our expense to continue to benefit from reduced advertising activity in the foreseeable future. 

Interest Expense (Income) . Interest expense increased by 0.7 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023 due primarily to higher year-over-year finance lease interest expense as a result of rising interest rates. 
 - 24 - 

Income Tax Expense . The provision for income taxes was 12.5 million and 1.0 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. The provision for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 reflected the establishment of a valuation allowance of 21.8 million against the net amount of deferred tax assets as well as a pre-tax loss in the current year. See Note 8 to the Interim Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a further discussion of our evaluation of deferred tax assets. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal liquidity requirements are for working capital, capital expenditures and cash dividends. We fund our liquidity requirements primarily through cash on hand, cash flows from operations and borrowings from our revolving credit facility. 
 As of September 29, 2024, we had 4.0 million of cash compared to 17.9 million of cash as of October 1, 2023. Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are summarized as follows:

Operating Activities . Operating cash flows for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and 2023 were a positive 9.1 million and a positive 21.1 million, respectively. The decreased cash flow provided by operating activities for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year primarily reflected a current year net loss compared with prior year net income, partially offset by reduced funding of merchandise inventory, a smaller decrease in accrued expenses mainly related to company performance-based incentive awards, as well as decreases in sales taxes and property taxes, and a larger decrease in prepaid expense primarily related to insurance and income taxes. 
 Investing Activities . Net cash used in investing activities for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and 2023 was 8.8 million and 8.2 million, respectively. Capital expenditures, excluding non-cash acquisitions, represented substantially all of the cash used in investing activities. Capital expenditures for both periods primarily reflect store-related remodeling, distribution center investments and computer hardware and software purchases. 
 Financing Activities . Financing cash flows for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and 2023 were a negative 5.5 million and a negative 20.6 million, respectively. For both periods presented, cash was used to make principal payments on finance lease liabilities and fund dividend payments. Dividend payments in the current year were lower than the prior year, which reflected a reduction of dividends declared from 0.75 per share of outstanding common stock in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 to 0.10 per share of outstanding common stock in the first nine months of fiscal 2024. 
 As of September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, we had no revolving credit borrowings, and 5.2 million and 1.4 million, respectively, of letter of credit commitments outstanding. 
 In the first nine months of fiscal 2023, we paid three quarterly cash dividends of 0.25 per share of outstanding common stock, and in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of 0.125 per share of outstanding common stock. In the first half of fiscal 2024, we paid two quarterly cash dividends of 0.05 per share of outstanding common stock. In an effort to provide additional financial flexibility given the uncertain duration of current macroeconomic challenges, our Board of Directors suspended the quarterly cash dividend beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

Periodically, we repurchase our common stock in the open market pursuant to programs approved by our Board of Directors. We may repurchase our common stock for a variety of reasons, including, among other things, our alternative cash requirements, existing business conditions and the current market price of our stock. Our current share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to 25.0 million of our common stock. Under this program, we may purchase shares from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in compliance with the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. However, the timing and amount of such purchases, if any, would be at the discretion of our management and Board of Directors, and would depend on market conditions and other considerations. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in fiscal 2023 or the first nine months of fiscal 2024. Since the inception of our initial share repurchase program in May 2006 through September 29, 2024, we have repurchased a total of 4,186,014 shares for 53.6 million. 
 Loan Agreement . We are party to a Loan, Guaranty and Security agreement with Bank of America, N.A. BofA ), as agent and lender, which was amended on November 22, 2021, October 19, 2022 and May 16, 2023 (as so amended, the Loan Agreement ). The Loan Agreement has a maturity date of February 24, 2026 and provides for a revolving credit facility with an aggregate committed availability of up to 150.0 million. We may also request additional increases in aggregate availability, up to a maximum of 200.0 million, in which case the existing lender under the Loan Agreement will have the option to increase their commitment to accommodate the requested increase. If the lender does not exercise that option, we may (with the consent of BofA in its role as the administrative agent, not to be unreasonably withheld) seek other lenders willing to provide such commitments. The credit facility includes a 50.0 million sublimit for issuances of letters of credit. 
 We may borrow under the Loan Agreement from time to time, provided the amounts outstanding will not exceed the lesser of the then aggregate committed availability (as discussed above) and the Borrowing Base (such lesser amount being referred to as the Line Cap ). As defined in the Loan Agreement, the Borrowing Base generally is comprised of the sum, at the time of calculation, of (a) 90.00 of eligible credit card receivables; plus (b) the cost of eligible inventory (other than eligible in-transit inventory), net of inventory reserves, multiplied by 90.00 of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory (expressed as a percentage of the cost of eligible inventory); plus (c) the cost of eligible in-transit inventory, net of inventory reserves, multiplied by 90.00 of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible in-transit inventory (expressed as a percentage of the cost of eligible in-transit inventory), minus (d) certain agreed-upon reserves as well as other reserves established by BofA in its role as the administrative agent in its reasonable discretion. 
 Generally, we may designate specific borrowings under the Loan Agreement as either base rate loans or Term SOFR rate loans. The applicable interest rate on our borrowings is a function of the daily average, over the preceding fiscal quarter, of the excess of the Line Cap over amounts borrowed (such amount being referred to as the Average Daily Availability ). Those loans designated as Term SOFR rate loans bear interest at a rate equal to the then applicable secured overnight financing rate as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York SOFR rate plus a 0.10 SOFR adjustment spread, plus an applicable margin as shown in the table below. Those loans designated as base rate loans bear interest at a rate equal to the applicable margin for base rate loans (as shown below) plus the highest of (a) the Federal funds rate, as in effect from time to time, plus one-half of one percent (0.50 ), (b) the one-month SOFR rate, plus one percentage point (1.00 ), or (c) the rate of interest in effect for such day as announced from time to time within BofA as its prime rate. The applicable margin for all loans will be a function of Average Daily Availability for the preceding fiscal quarter as set forth in the following table. 

Level 
 
 Average Daily Availability 
 
 SOFR Rate Applicable Margin 
 
 Base Rate Applicable Margin 

I 
 
 Greater than or equal to 70,000,000

II

 1.500 
 
 0.500 

The commitment fee assessed on the unused portion of the credit facility is 0.20 per annum.

Obligations under the Loan Agreement are secured by a general lien on and security interest in substantially all of our assets. The Loan Agreement contains covenants that require us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.0:1.0 in certain circumstances, and limits the ability to, among other things, incur liens, incur additional indebtedness, transfer or dispose of assets, change the nature of the business, guarantee obligations, pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase stock, and make advances, loans or investments. We may generally declare or pay cash dividends or repurchase stock only if, among other things, no default or event of default then exists or would arise from such dividend or repurchase of stock and, after giving effect to such dividend or repurchase, certain availability and/or fixed charge coverage ratio requirements are satisfied, although we are permitted to make up to 5.0 million of dividend payments or stock repurchases per year without satisfaction of the availability or fixed charge coverage ratio requirements, but dividends or stock repurchases made without satisfying the availability and/or fixed charge coverage ratio requirements will require the establishment of an additional reserve that will reduce borrowing availability under the Loan Agreement for 75 days. The Loan Agreement contains customary events of default, including, without limitation, failure to pay when due principal amounts with respect to the credit facility, failure to pay any interest or other amounts under the credit facility, failure to comply with certain agreements or covenants contained in the Loan Agreement, failure to satisfy certain judgments against us, failure to pay when due (or any other default which permits the acceleration of) certain other material indebtedness in principal amount in excess of 5.0 million, and certain insolvency and bankruptcy events. 
 Future Capital Requirements . We had cash on hand of 4.0 million as of September 29, 2024. We expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2024, excluding non-cash acquisitions, to range from approximately 10.0 million to 14.0 million primarily to fund store-related remodeling, the opening of new stores, distribution center investments and computer hardware and software purchases. For fiscal 2024, we anticipate opening approximately three new stores and closing approximately eleven stores. 
 Dividends are paid at the discretion of our Board of Directors. In the first half of fiscal 2024, we paid two quarterly cash dividends of 0.05 per share of outstanding common stock. In an effort to provide additional financial flexibility given the uncertain duration of current macroeconomic challenges, our Board of Directors suspended the quarterly cash dividend beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 As of September 29, 2024, a total of 20.9 million remained available for share repurchases under our new share repurchase program. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in the first nine months of fiscal 2024. We consider several factors in determining when and if we make share repurchases including, among other things, our alternative cash requirements, existing business conditions and the market price of our stock. 
 We believe we will be able to fund our cash requirements from cash on hand, operating cash flows and borrowings from our credit facility, for at least the next 12 months. 
 Contractual Obligations . Our material contractual obligations include operating lease commitments associated with our leased properties and other occupancy expense, finance lease obligations, borrowings under the credit facility, if any, and other liabilities. Operating lease commitments consist principally of leases for our retail store facilities, distribution center and corporate offices. These leases frequently include options which permit us to extend the terms beyond the initial fixed lease term, and we intend to renegotiate most of these leases as they expire. Operating lease commitments also consist of information technology IT systems hardware, distribution center delivery tractors and equipment. Additional information regarding our operating and finance leases is available in Notes 2 and 6 to the Interim Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 In the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and 2023, we had zero borrowings under our revolving credit facility. In October 2024, the Company resumed borrowings on the revolving credit facility. 
 In the ordinary course of business, we enter into arrangements with vendors to purchase merchandise in advance of expected delivery. Because most of these purchase orders do not contain any termination payments or other penalties if cancelled, they are not included as outstanding contractual obligations. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 As discussed in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, we consider our estimates on valuation of merchandise inventory and valuation of long-lived assets to be among the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements. There have been no significant changes to these estimates in the 13 weeks ended September 29, 2024.

Seasonality and Impact of Inflation 
 We experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating results, which can suffer when weather does not conform to seasonal norms. Seasonality in our net sales influences our buying patterns which directly impacts our merchandise and accounts payable levels and cash flows. We purchase merchandise for seasonal activities in advance of a season and supplement our merchandise assortment as necessary and when possible during the season. Our efforts to replenish products during a season are not always successful. In the fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday selling season and the start of the winter selling season, we normally experience higher inventory purchase volumes and increased expense for staffing and advertising. If we miscalculate the consumer demand for our products generally or for our product mix in advance of a season, particularly the fourth quarter, our net sales can decline, which can harm our financial performance. A significant shortfall from expected net sales, particularly during the fourth quarter, can negatively impact our annual operating results. 
 Throughout most of fiscal 2023, we experienced greater inflation in the cost of products that we purchase for resale than in previous years, although product cost inflation moderated later in the year and into fiscal 2024. While our merchandise inventory costs have been impacted by inflationary pressures, we have generally been able to adjust our selling prices in response to these higher product purchase costs. However, if we are unable to adjust our selling prices for product purchase cost increases that might occur in the future, then our merchandise margins could decline, which would adversely impact our operating results. In fiscal 2023 and the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we also experienced increased wage rate pressure as a result of competition for labor in certain markets and we expect these dynamics to continue throughout the remainder of fiscal 2024. Broad-based inflationary pressures adversely impacted many categories of costs and expenses, including shipping costs, during fiscal 2023 and the first nine months of fiscal 2024. This impact is expected to continue during the remainder of fiscal 2024.

PART II. OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 On March 13, 2023, a complaint was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara, entitled Zareyah Thompson v. Big 5 Corp., et. al., Case No. 23CV412334 Thompson Complaint ). The Thompson Complaint was brought as a purported California Private Attorneys General Act PAGA action on behalf of current and former employees who worked for the Company or its operating subsidiary in California as a non-exempt, hourly paid employee and received at least one wage statement. The Thompson Complaint alleges, among other things, that Big 5 failed to (i) provide minimum wages, (ii) provide compliant meal or rest periods, (iii) maintain and provide accurate itemized wage statements, (iv) properly compensate for all time worked, including overtime, premium, vacation and final wages, (v) properly maintain payroll records, and (vi) provide suitable seating. On March 21, 2023, a second complaint was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara, entitled Christopher Puga v. Big 5 Corp., et. al., Case No. 23CV412953 Puga Complaint ). The Puga Complaint was brought as a purported PAGA action on behalf of all current and former non-exempt employees that worked either directly or via a staffing agency for the Company or its operating subsidiary at any location in California Putative Covered Employees ). The Puga Complaint alleges, among other things, that Big 5 (i) unlawfully required Putative Covered Employees to agree to unlawful criminal background checks, (ii) conducted unlawful financial and criminal background checks, and did not (iii) provide minimum wages, (iv) provide accurate itemized wage statements, (v) maintain accurate records pertaining to the Putative Covered Employees employment, (vi) produce or make available Putative Covered Employees personnel records and/or payroll records, (vii) provide compliant meal or rest periods, (viii) properly compensate for all time worked, including overtime, premium, vacation, and final wages, (ix) reimburse necessary business expenses; (x) provide suitable seating; (xi) provide sick leave pay to Putative Covered Employees, (xii) accurately calculate sick leave accrual and rate of pay, (xiii) put the Putative Covered Employees on notice of their paid sick leave rights, and (xiv) provide supplemental paid sick leave. The Thompson and Puga complaints have many overlapping causes of action. Accordingly, on or about April 12, 2023, a notice of related cases was filed with the Court regarding the Thompson Complaint and Puga Complaint. The Court subsequently conducted a case management conference on June 29, 2023 for both complaints, and jointly coordinated the complaints. The Company s counsel held a mediation with opposing counsel on September 27, 2023. The Company has reached a settlement in both cases and established a cumulative indemnity reserve of 1.5 million. The settlement has been approved by the Court and the Company deposited the settlement funds with the settlement administrator on October 4, 2024. 
 The Company is involved in various other claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations or financial condition.
