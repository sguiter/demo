 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 segments human health and animal health and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Nasdaq Communication and Compliance Minimum Bid Price Requirement On May 10, 2023, the Listing Qualifications Staff (the Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC issued to the Company a notification citing its failure to comply with the minimum bid price requirement under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Minimum Bid Price Requirement ). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company was initially provided calendar days, or until November 6, 2023, and was subsequently granted an additional calendar day period, or until May 6, 2024, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. However, on February 15, 2024, the Company received a delisting determination letter from the Staff in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(iii) due to the Company s securities having a closing bid price of or less for ten consecutive trading days. Accordingly, on February 29, 2024, the Company requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel ), which automatically stayed the delisting of the Company s common stock from Nasdaq pending a decision from the Panel. Pursuant to a review process, the Panel provided notice on April 5, 2024, granting the Company s request to extend the period for it to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement until August 13, 2024. On June 25, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Nasdaq Office of General Counsel notifying the Company that the minimum bid price deficiency had been cured and that The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC had determined to continue the listing of the Company s common stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market. Liquidity and Going Concern The Company, since its inception, has incurred recurring operating losses and negative cash flows from operations and has an accumulated deficit of million as of September 30, 2024. The Company expects to incur substantial losses and negative cash flows in future periods. Further, the Company s future operations, which include the satisfaction of current obligations, are dependent on the success of the Company s ongoing development and commercialization efforts, as well as securing additional financing and generating positive cash flows from operations. There is no assurance that the Company will have adequate cash balances to maintain its operations. Although the Company plans to finance its operations and cash flow needs through equity and/or debt financing, collaboration arrangements with other entities, license royalty agreements, as well as revenue from future product sales, the Company does not believe its current cash balances are sufficient to fund its operating plan through one year from the issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that additional funding will be available to the Company on acceptable terms or on a timely basis, if at all, or that the Company will generate sufficient cash from operations to adequately fund operating needs. If the Company is unable to obtain an adequate level of financing needed for the long-term

. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance of assets are charged to expenses as incurred. Costs of major additions and betterments are capitalized and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Upon retirement or sale, the cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets disposed of are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is included in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 . The Company evaluated the carrying value of its internal use software costs as at December 31, 2023, in accordance with ASC 360-10, Impairment of Long-lived Assets to be Held or Used . Based on the evaluation, the Company determined that the internal use software costs registry's carrying value as of December 31, 2023, were no longer recoverable and recorded a corresponding impairment loss. The impairment loss was calculated as the difference between the registry's carrying value and its estimated fair value on December 31, 2023. The fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow DCF model, a Level 3 evaluation technique under ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements ASC 820 ). The DCF model utilized entity-specific assumptions regarding future sales volume, pricing, and costs. These assumptions considered factors such as the continuity of existing customer relationships, potential shifts in economic conditions, and other relevant market influences. The net cash flows generated by the model were then discounted to present value using a rate reflective of the time value of money and the inherent use associated with the expected cash flows. The discount rate was based on the comparable debt instrument deemed appropriate by management. Given the changing market conditions, there is a reasonable possibility that the estimates used to determine the registry's fair value may require adjustments in the near future. Any such changes in assumptions could result in further impairment charges. The Company recognized an expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 , and a corresponding reduction in the carrying value of the internal use software-registry as a result of the impairment. 
 of the Company s long-lived assets were deemed impaired as of September 30, 2024 .

promises, namely (1) the grant of license to manufacture and commercialize pharmaceutical products that utilize Crofelemer (the Licensing Transaction and (2) the supply of Crofelemer Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient API ). Licensee cannot benefit from the license alone without the API as the latter comes from a plant exclusive to the Company. No other entities can produce the API. Consequently, the grant of license and the supply API are not distinct, and accounted as a single performance obligation. Transaction price Transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The transaction price in the contract with GEN includes both fixed and variable considerations. For the Licensing Transaction, the fixed consideration is measured as the difference between the proceeds from the related share issuance and the fair value of the shares issued. The variable consideration, in the form of royalty, is based on a percentage of the Licensee's revenue from the sale of pharmaceutical products utilizing Crofelemer. For the supply of Crofelemer API, the variable consideration is determined using the expected value of a wide range of possible amounts. Allocate transaction price The entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation contained in the contract. Revenue recognition The single performance obligation is satisfied over-time, throughout the license period, based on the expiration dates of the licensed patents.

Ending fair value of Level 3 liability 

The fair value of the Streeterville Note recognized as a Level 3 liability at the date of issuance and as of September 30, 2024 , amounted to million and million, respectively. The fair value of the remaining Level 3 liabilities at the extinguishment date and as of September 30, 2024 , amounted to million and million. The fair values were based on the weighted average discounted expected future cash flows representing the terms of the notes, discounting them to their present value equivalents. The notes were classified as Level 3 fair values in the fair value hierarchy due to the use of unobservable inputs, including the Company s own credit risk. The Company determined and performed the valuations with the assistance of an independent valuation service provider. On a quarterly basis, the Company considers the main Level 3 inputs for hybrid instruments used derived as follows: Discount rate which was determined using a comparison of various effective yields on bonds as of the valuation date

Fair Value Option The Company elected to apply the FVO accounting to certain freestanding instruments and to the entire class of hybrid instruments, including structured notes, of which there are assessed embedded derivatives that would be eligible for bifurcation, to align the measurement attributes of those instruments under U.S. GAAP and to simplify the accounting model applied to these financial instruments. The valuations of these instruments were predominantly driven by the discount rate and the derivative features embedded within the instruments. The Company determined and performed the valuations of the freestanding and hybrid instruments with the assistance of an independent valuation service provider. The valuation methodology utilized is consistent with the income approach for estimating the fair value of the interest-bearing portion of the instruments and the related derivatives. Cash flows of the financial instruments in their entirety, including the embedded derivatives, are discounted at an appropriate rate for the applicable duration of the instrument. Interests on the interest-bearing portion of the instruments held to maturity and mark-to-market adjustments are aggregated in the change in fair value of freestanding and hybrid financial instruments designated at FVO in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not note any fair value movement on FVO liabilities attributable to any instrument-specific credit risk, which should be recorded in other comprehensive income (loss).

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q and with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10 K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 which was filed to the SEC on April 1, 2024 and amended on April 17, 2024. 
 Overview 
 Jaguar Health, Inc. Jaguar or the Company is a commercial-stage pharmaceuticals company focused on developing novel, plant-based, sustainably derived prescription medicines for people and animals with gastrointestinal GI distress, including chronic, debilitating diarrhea. Jaguar's wholly owned subsidiary, Napo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Napo ), focuses on developing and commercializing proprietary plant-based human prescriptions from plants for essential supportive care and management of neglected GI symptoms across multiple complicated disease states. Our crofelemer drug product candidate is the subject of the OnTarget study, a recently completed pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial for prophylaxis of diarrhea in adult cancer patients receiving targeted therapy. The recently completed analysis of the prespecified subgroup of adult patients with breast cancer from OnTarget indicates that crofelemer achieved statistical significance in this subgroup. Patients with breast cancer accounted for nearly 180 of the 287 participants in this unprecedented prophylactic clinical trial in adult patients with solid tumors receiving targeted therapy with or without standard chemotherapy. This data in breast cancer patients has been submitted to a relevant oncology conference by the study's primary investigators, and a full study report for the breast cancer results is expected to be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal. Additional analyses of OnTarget prespecified subgroups are ongoing, and we believe data from additional analyses may result in future submissions to peer-reviewed forums. As announced, the initial top line results from the OnTarget study showed that the multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal clinical trial did not meet its primary estimand for the prespecified analysis of all tumor types. The subgroup analysis in adult breast cancer patients demonstrates that crofelemer provides clinically meaningful improvement in this patient population, and suggests that crofelemer has the potential to help breast cancer patients to better adhere to their cancer therapies. The subgroup analyses also show that crofelemer provides clinically meaningful improvement in the prespecified subgroup of lung cancer patients . 
 As part of our strategy to expand our commercial footprint beyond HIV-related supportive care to include cancer-related supportive care, on April 12, 2024, we entered into an exclusive 5-year in-license agreement with United Kingdom-based Venture Life Group PLC Venture Life ), an international consumer health company focused on the global self-care market, for Venture Life's 510(k) cleared oral mucositis prescription product, Gelclair, for the U.S. market. Gelclair is a 510(k) cleared prescription product and can be commercialized without any clinical development costs for Jaguar. We initiated the commercial launch in October 2024 for Gelclair. Oral mucositis is among the most common, painful, and debilitating cancer treatment-related side effects. Gelclair is a protective gel with a mechanical action indicated for the management of pain and relief of pain by adhering to the mucosal surface of the mouth, soothing oral lesions of various etiologies, including oral mucositis/stomatitis. Unlike other products for oral mucositis, it is not a numbing agent and does not sting the mouth. 
 Jaguar is the majority stockholder of Napo Therapeutics S.p.A. Napo Therapeutics ), an Italian corporation established by Jaguar in Milan, Italy, in 2021, focusing on expanding crofelemer access in Europe. Napo Therapeutics core mission is to provide access to crofelemer in Europe to address significant rare/orphan disease indications, including, initially, two key rare disease target indications: Short bowel syndrome SBS with intestinal failure and microvillus inclusion disease MVID an ultrarare congenital diarrheal disorders ("CDD"). Jaguar Animal Health is a tradename of Jaguar Health. Magdalena Biosciences Inc. Magdalena ), a joint venture formed by Jaguar and Filament Health Corp. Filament that emerged from Jaguar s Entheogen Therapeutics Initiative ETI ), is focused on identifying the next generation of plant-based first-in-class agents for treatment of mental health conditions. 
 Jaguar was founded in San Francisco, California as a Delaware corporation on June 6, 2013 (inception). The Company was a majority-owned subsidiary of Napo until the close of the Company's initial public offering on May 18, 2015. The Company was formed to develop and commercialize first-in-class prescription and non-prescription products for companion animals. 
 On July 31, 2017, Jaguar completed a merger with Napo pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated March 31, 2017, by and among Jaguar, Napo, Napo Acquisition Corporation Merger Sub ), and Napo's representative (the Merger Agreement ). In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, upon the completion of the merger, Merger Sub merged with and into Napo, with Napo surviving as the wholly owned subsidiary (the Merger or Napo Merger ). Immediately following the merger, Jaguar changed its name from Jaguar Animal Health, Inc. to Jaguar Health, Inc. Napo now operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of Jaguar focused on human health, including the ongoing development of crofelemer and commercialization of Mytesi. 
 Napo s marketed drug Mytesi (crofelemer 125 mg delayed-release tablets) is a first-in-class oral botanical drug product approved by the FDA for the symptomatic relief of noninfectious diarrhea in adults with HIV/AIDS on antiretroviral therapy. To date, this is the only oral plant-based botanical prescription medicine approved under the FDA s Botanical Guidance. The Company s

Canalevia-CA1 (crofelemer delayed-release tablets) drug is the first and only oral plant-based prescription product that is FDA conditionally approved to treat chemotherapy-induced diarrhea CID in dogs. 
 Crofelemer was granted Orphan Drug Designation ODD by the FDA in February 2023 for MVID and granted ODD for MVID by the European Medicines Agency EMA in October 2022. Crofelemer was granted ODD for SBS by the EMA in December 2021 and by the FDA in August 2017. In August 2023, Napo s Investigational New Drug IND application was activated by the FDA for a new crofelemer powder for oral solution formulation for treating MVID. Our global MVID phase 2 trial for Jaguar is being conducted under this IND. The global phase 2 trial of crofelemer in adults with SBS with intestinal failure is taking place under a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) approved by European health authorities. These phase 2 studies are planned to initiate in the fourth quarter of 2024. We expect that enrollment will continue in 2025 for each of these phase 2 trials, with data expected in the beginning of 2026 for both trials. Additionally, Jaguar is supporting independent investigator-initiated proof-of-concept POC studies of crofelemer for the rare disease indications of SBS with intestinal failure and MVID, focused on obtaining POC data showing reduction of requirements of parenteral support, including parenteral nutrition and IV fluids. In accordance with the guidelines of specific European Union countries, publications of data from POC trials and Phase 2 trials could support participation in early patient access programs for crofelemer for SBS or MVID, especially for patients with intestinal failure requiring parenteral support. Participation in early access programs, which do not exist in the United States, provides an opportunity for reimbursement while impacting the morbidity and high cost of care for these chronic unmet needs. 
 Napo Therapeutics is initiating efforts to commence clinical development of crofelemer in SBS patients in support of the Company s key focus on leveraging the EMA s accelerated conditional marketing authorization pathway in Europe for these rare diseases. SBS affects approximately 10,000 to 20,000 people in the U.S., according to the Crohn's Colitis Foundation, and it is estimated that the population of SBS patients in Europe is approximately the same size. Despite limited treatment options, the global SBS market exceeded 568 million in 2019 and is expected to reach 4.6 billion by 2027, according to a report by Vision Research Reports. 
 Most of the activities of the Company are focused on the development and commercialization of Mytesi, the ongoing clinical development of crofelemer for the prophylaxis of diarrhea in adult patients receiving targeted cancer therapy, the ongoing commercial launch of Gelclair, and our prioritized clinical program centered around investigator-initiated POC trials of crofelemer for SBS and CDD. 
 In the field of animal health, we are continuing limited activities related to developing and commercializing first-in-class GI products for dogs, dairy calves, and foals. 
 Crofelemer is a novel, first-in-class anti-secretory antidiarrheal drug that has a normalizing effect on electrolyte and fluid balance in the gut, and this mechanism of action has the potential to benefit multiple disorders that cause GI distress, including diarrhea and abdominal discomfort. Crofelemer is in development for multiple possible follow-on indications, including for our lead Phase 3 program in cancer therapy-related diarrhea CTD ), investigating prophylaxis of diarrhea related to targeted therapy with or without standard chemotherapy. Crofelemer delayed-release tablets are also being evaluated in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome IBS-D and being evaluated for chronic idiopathic/functional diarrhea in investigator-initiated trials. 
 Crofelemer powder for oral solution is being developed to support orphan or rare disease indications for adults with SBS with intestinal failure and for pediatric MVID patients. 
 In addition, a second-generation proprietary anti-secretory antidiarrheal drug NP-300 is in development for symptomatic relief and treatment of moderate-to-severe diarrhea, with or without concomitant antimicrobial therapy, from bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections, including Vibrio cholerae , the bacterium that causes cholera. This program is being pursued with the potential targeted incentive from the FDA for a tropical disease priority review voucher. 
 In January 2023, Jaguar and Filament, with funding from One Small Planet, formed the U.S.-based joint venture Magdalena. Magdalena s focus is on the development of novel, natural prescription medicines derived from plants for mental health indications, including, initially, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ADHD in adults. The goal of the collaboration is to extend the botanical drug development capabilities of Jaguar and Filament in order to develop pharmaceutical-grade, standardized drug candidates for mental health disorders and to partner with a potential future licensee to develop and commercialize these novel plant-based drugs. This venture aligns with Jaguar's ETI program and Filament's corporate mission to develop novel, natural prescription medicines from plants. Magdalena will leverage Jaguar's proprietary medicinal plant library and Filament's proprietary drug development technology. Jaguar s library of 2,300 highly characterized medicinal plants and 3,500 plant extracts, all from firsthand ethnobotanical investigation by Jaguar and members of the ETI Scientific Strategy Team, is a key asset we have generated over 30 years that bridges the knowledge of traditional healers and Western medicine. Magdalena holds an exclusive license to plants and plant extracts in Jaguar's library, not including any sources of crofelemer or NP-300, for specific indications and is in the process of

Table of Contents 

identifying plant candidates in the library that may prove beneficial for addressing indications such as ADHD. Magdalena is approximately 40-percent owned by Jaguar. 
 As announced, Jaguar recently executed an out-license deal with Magdalena for a botanical drug candidate for possible schizophrenia and psychoses indications and for development with potential corporate partners. Sourced from a medicinal plant that has a long history of use by traditional healers, the drug candidate demonstrates antipsychotic activity and has a mechanism of action distinct from currently FDA-approved therapies for schizophrenia and other mental conditions that present psychotic symptoms. The drug candidate may have the potential to be the first in a new class of plant-based antipsychotic compounds. 
 In December 2021, we received conditional approval from the FDA to market Canalevia-CA1 (crofelemer delayed-release tablets), our oral plant-based prescription drug and the only available veterinary drug for the treatment of CID in dogs, and Canalevia-CA1 is now available to multiple leading veterinary distributors in the U.S. Canalevia-CA1 is a tablet that is given orally and can be prescribed for home treatment of CID. The FDA conditionally approves Canalevia-CA1 under application number 141-552. Conditional approval allows for product commercialization while Jaguar Animal Health continues to collect the substantial evidence of effectiveness required for full approval. We have received a Minor Use in a Major Species MUMS designation from the FDA for Canalevia-CA1 to treat CID in dogs. FDA has established a small number threshold for minor use in each of the seven major species covered by the MUMS Act. The small number threshold is currently 80,000 for dogs, representing the largest number of dogs that can be affected by a disease or condition over a year and still have the use qualify as a minor use. 
 We believe Jaguar is poised to realize a number of synergistic, value-adding benefits an expanded pipeline of potential blockbuster human follow-on indications of crofelemer and a second-generation anti-secretory agent upon which to build global partnerships. Jaguar, through Napo, holds global unencumbered rights for crofelemer, Mytesi, and Canalevia-CA1. Additionally, several drug product opportunities in Jaguar s crofelemer pipeline are backed by Phase 2 and POC evidence from human clinical trials. 
 Financial Operations Overview 
 On a consolidated basis, we have not yet generated enough revenue to date to achieve break-even or positive cash flows, and we expect to continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses. Our net loss was 29.0 million and 32.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had a total stockholders' equity of 13.1 million, an accumulated deficit of 336.6 million, and cash of 13.3 million. We expect to continue to incur losses, and experience increased expenditures for the foreseeable future as we expand our product development activities, seek necessary approvals for our product candidates, conduct species-specific formulation studies for our non-prescription products, establish API manufacturing capabilities and begin additional commercialization activities. Payments of cash compensation to directors under the Director Compensation Program or the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to 109,000 and 218,000, respectively. 
 Revenues 
 Our product and license revenue consists of the following: 
 Revenues from the sale of our human drug Mytesi are sold through distributors, wholesalers, and specialty pharmacies. 

Revenues from the sale of our animal products branded as Canalevia-CA1, Neonorm Calf, and Neonorm Foal. Our Canalevia-CA1, Neonorm, and botanical extract products are primarily sold to distributors, who then sell the products to the end customers. 

Revenues from the license agreement made with Gen Ilac Ve Saglik Urunleri Sanayi Ve Ticaret, A.S., ("Gen") ("Licensee") from which all finished Mytesi are sold in the licensed territory. 

Our policy typically permits returns if the product is damaged, defective, or otherwise cannot be used when received by the customer if the product has expired. Returns are accepted for products that will expire within six months or that have expired up to one year after their expiration dates. Estimates for expected returns of expired products are based primarily on an ongoing analysis of our historical return patterns. 

See Results of Operations below for a more detailed discussion on revenues.

Costs of Product Revenue 
 The cost of revenue consists of direct drug substance and drug product materials expenses, direct labor, distribution fees, royalties, and other related expenses associated with the sale of our products. 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of clinical and contract manufacturing, personnel and related benefits, stock-based compensation, employee travel, and reforestation expenses. Clinical and contract manufacturing expenses consist primarily of costs for stability, safety, and efficacy studies and manufacturing startup at an outsourced API provider in Italy. It also includes expenses with a third-party provider for transferring the Mytesi manufacturing process and the related feasibility and validation activities. 
 We typically use our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple development programs. We track outsourced development costs by prescription drug product candidate and non-prescription product, and we track personnel or other internal costs related to the development of specific programs or development compounds. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company has incurred approximately 4.8 million on its primary R D projects. The timing and amount of our research and development expenses will depend largely upon the outcomes of current and future trials for our prescription drug product candidates, as well as the related regulatory requirements, the outcomes of current and future species-specific formulation studies for our non-prescription products, manufacturing costs and any costs associated with the advancement of our line extension programs. We cannot determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of the current or future development activities. The total project costs remain uncertain due to regulatory and clinical trial complexities. Management continues to monitor timelines closely to address any risks that could impact timely project completion and future operations. 
 The duration, costs, and timing of trials, formulation studies, and development of our prescription drug and non-prescription products will depend on a variety of factors, including: 
 the scope, rate of progress, and expense of our ongoing, as well as any additional clinical trials, formulation studies, and other research and development activities; 

future clinical trial and formulation study results; 

potential changes in government regulations and; 

the timing and receipt of any regulatory approvals. 

A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a prescription drug product candidate or non-prescription product could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with our development activities. 
 We expect research and development expenses to decrease with the Phase 3 OnTarget Trial completion in the first half of 2025; though we expect start-up costs associated with our clinical trials for other indications. 
 Materials expense and tree planting refers to the Company's ongoing environmental costs related to the sustainable sourcing of crofelemer and reforestation activities in the Amazon Rainforest. These expenses include capital investments in seedling nurseries and tree planting. As of September 30, 2024, no significant non-recurring environmental remediation costs are anticipated. The Company continues to monitor its environmental impact and may incur future costs as needed. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel and related benefits, stock-based compensation, direct sales and marketing, employee travel, and management consulting expenses. We currently incur sales and marketing expenses to promote Mytesi and GelClair. We do not have significant marketing or promotional expenses related to Canalevia and Neonorm Calf or Neonorm Foal for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase going forward as we focus on expanding our market access activities and commercial partnerships to develop follow-on indications of Mytesi, GelClair and crofelemer. 
 51 

Table of Contents 

General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses consist of personnel and related benefits expenses, stock-based compensation expenses, employee travel expenses, legal and accounting fees, rent and facilities expenses, and management consulting expenses. 
 In the near term, we expect general and administrative expenses to remain flat as we focus on our pipeline development and market access expansion. This will include efforts to grow the business. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense consists primarily of non-cash and cash interest costs related to our borrowings. 
 Change in Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Hybrid Instrument Designated at FVO 
 Change in fair value of financial instruments and hybrid instruments designated at FVO consists of gain or loss recognized related to fair values changes of our instruments designated at FVO. 
 Gain on Debt Extinguishment 
 Gain on debt extinguishment consists of gain incurred related to the exchanges resulting from the extinguishment of our borrowings. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 
 Preparing condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires using estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and that have a material impact on financial condition or operating performance. While we base our estimates and judgments on our experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Note 2 of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements describes our significant accounting policies. Our critical accounting policies and estimates were described in Part II, Item 7, Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Potential Material Effects of Trends, Events, and Uncertainties 
 Inflation Reduction Act 
 The Inflation Reduction Act, effective January 1, 2023, introduces several provisions that may impact the Company's operations and financial results. While the full effects of the Act on future results are uncertain, management acknowledges potential changes in market conditions, tax incentives, and regulatory requirements that could arise as a result of this legislation. Management is currently unable to predict the likelihood or timing of these changes and their specific implications for the Company s financial performance. The pharmaceutical industry may face impacts from new pricing regulations and changes in tax incentives for research and development. 
 Management will continue to monitor developments closely and assess any potential impacts. However, at this time, it is not possible to determine a range of likely effects on future results. Should circumstances warrant, the Company will disclose any material impacts as they become known. 
 Lease Commitments 
 The Company's lease obligations constitute a significant portion of its operating expenses and are anticipated to affect future cash flows. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has committed to multiple lease agreements, including a primary office lease in San Francisco that commenced on September 1, 2021, and extends until February 28, 2025. This lease includes a structured rent increase, beginning at 42,000 per month and escalating to 45,000 by the final year. 
 
 52 

Table of Contents 

Additionally, the Company has entered into a lease for Suite 400, which commenced on September 1, 2023, and extends through August 31, 2030, with initial monthly rent set at 18,000. The lease agreements also incorporate provisions for periodic rent increases tied to inflation, which may introduce variability in future cash flows. 
 Given these escalating lease commitments, particularly the planned increases in base rent and the uncertainties surrounding the potential exercise of extension options, the Company is focused on maintaining effective liquidity management strategies to address potential cash flow impacts. Moreover, fluctuations in occupancy rates or operational changes may affect the utilization of leased spaces, thereby influencing amortization expenses associated with right-of-use assets. 
 The Company regularly evaluates its lease portfolio and market conditions to make informed decisions regarding future lease renewals or new lease agreements. Effective management of these lease liabilities will be essential for ensuring operational flexibility and financial stability in the upcoming years.

The decrease in R D expense of 3.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 was largely due to: 
 Clinical and contract manufacturing decreased by 1.9 million from 6.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.8 million in the same period in 2024 as the Phase 3 On Target Clinical Trial concluded, reducing the clinical trial-related costs and external contract manufacturing services. 

Personnel and related benefits increased by 211,000 from 4.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 4.7 million in the same period in 2024 due to new internship program and employee promotions, increasing payroll and benefits expenses. 

Stock-based compensation decreased by 194,000 from 756,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 562,000 in the same period in 2024 due to fewer volume of stock incentive, options and RSUs granted during the period as compared to 2023. Additionally, no significant equity grants, except for new hires. 

Travel, and other expenses decreased by 140,000 from 273,000 for nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 133,000 in the same period in 2024 primarily due to reduced travel activities associated with CTD as the trial came a close. 

Other expenses consisting of consulting, formulation and regulatory fees decreased by 1.7 million from 2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.6 million in the same period in 2024, largely from the close-out of the CTD trial and mostly focused on statistical analyses of the CTD endpoints.

The decrease in G A expenses of 312,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 was largely due to: 
 Personnel and related benefits decreased by 163,000 from 3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 3.3 million in the same period in 2024 due to reduction in headcount within the Finance and General Administration departments. 

Third-party consulting services increased by 518,000 from 501,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 1.0 million in the same period in 2024 due to an increase in business development activities and complex accounting subjected for consultation. 

Audit, tax and consulting services decreased by 420,000 from 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 667,000 in the same period in 2024, primarily d ue to a reduction in the scope of audits conducted for Napo Thera. 

Travel and other expenses increased by 57,000 from 323,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 380,000 in the same period in 2024, more travel activity by the CEO to attract potential investors to the Company. 

Other expenses decreased by 282,000 from 3.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 2.9 million in the same period in 2024 primarily due to lower licenses and finance fees. 

Interest Expense 
 Interest expense decreased by 5.8 million from 6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 341,000 in the same period in 2024, primarily due to changes in accounting of certain debt instruments to FVO. The lower interest expense was offset by a higher loss in change in fair value of freestanding and hybrid financial instruments designated at FVO.

Change in Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Hybrid Instrument Designated at FVO 
 The fair value of financial instrument and hybrid instrument designated at FVO decreased by 3.6 million, from a loss of 3.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to a loss of 6.9 million in the same period in 2024 primarily due to fair value adjustments in liability classified warrants and notes payable designated at FVO. 
 Gain on Extinguishment of Debt 
 Gain on extinguishment of debt decreased by 2.5 million from 3.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 1.2 million in the same period in 2024 primarily due to significant modifications of royalty interest agreements resulting to extinguishment accounting. 
 Segment Data 
 The Company has two reportable segments: animal health and human health. The animal health segment develops and commercializes products for animals, while the human health segment focuses on human products, specifically Mytesi, which is approved for the symptomatic relief of non-infectious diarrhea in adults with HIV/AIDS on antiretroviral therapy.

Our gross product revenues were 4.0 million and 3.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These periods reflect revenue from the sale of our human drug Mytesi and our animal products branded as Canalevia-CA1, Neonorm Calf and Neonorm Foal. 
 The increase in gross product revenue of 330,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period 2023 was primarily due to the increase in the volume of sales of Mytesi and Canalevia, an increase of 266,000 and 25,000, respectively. The Company launched Gelclair during the quarter. However, revenue recognition will commence in the following quarters, in alignment with the timing of product sales and revenue recognition principles.

The increase in cost of product revenue of 27,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to: 
 Material cost increased by 24,000 from 231,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 255,000 in the same period in 2024, due to the increase in cost per bottle for Mytesi, following the additions made during the start of the year. 

Distribution fees increased by 23,000 from 15,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 38,000 in the same period in 2024, due to the third-party changes related to the sample program of expired inventory. 

Other costs increased by 6,000 from 9,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 15,000 in the same period in 2024 due to amortization of API which ended in 2023.

The change in R D expense of 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2024 was due primarily to: 
 Clinical and contract manufacturing expenses decreased by 2.0 million from 3.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 1.5 million in the same period in 2024, primarily largely from lower statistical analyses performed on the CTD endpoints and expenses related to SBS and MVID. 

Stock-based compensation decreased by 175,000 from 272,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 97,000 in the same period in 2024, primarily due to fewer volume of stock incentive, options and RSUs granted during the period as compared to 2023. Additionally, no significant equity grants, except for new hires. 

Travel and other expenses decreased by 24,000 from 59,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 35,000 in the same period in 2024 due to reduced travel activities associated with CTD as the trial came close.

The change in G A expenses of 243,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 was due primarily to: 
 Personnel and related benefits increased by 145,000 from 901,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 1.0 million in the same period in 2024, largely attributable higher personnel related benefits as compared in 2023. 

Legal services expenses increased by 99,000 from 292,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 391,000 in the same period in 2024, primarily due to increase in patent fees. 

Public company expenses decreased by 181,000 from 542,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 361,000 in the same period in 2024, largely attributable to the decrease in investor relations and public company filings. 

Third-party consulting increased by 109,000 from 260,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 369,000 in the same period in 2024, due to an increase in business development activities and complex accounting subjected for consultation. 

Audit, tax, and accounting services fees decreased by 409,000 from 494,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 85,000 in the same period in 2024, mostly primarily d ue to a reduction in the scope of audits conducted for Napo Thera. 

Travel and other expenses increased by 123,000 from 36,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 159,000 in the same period in 2024 due to more travel activity by the CEO to attract potential investors to the Company. 

Lease expense increased by 56,000 from 240,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 296,000 in the same period in 2024 primarily due to new lease agreement in Q1 2024. 

Other expenses increased by 345,000 from 543,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 888,000 in the same period in 2024 due to depreciation and amortization of fixed and intangible assets, insurance expenses, and other support services.

Interest Income (Expense) 
 Interest expense decreased by 662,000, from 500,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to a 162,000 net interest income for the same period in 2024, primarily due to changing the accounting of certain debt instruments to FVO. The lower interest expense was offset by a higher loss in a change in the fair value of financial instruments and hybrid instruments designated at FVO. 
 Change in Fair Value of Freestanding and Hybrid Financial Instruments Designated at FVO 
 Change in fair value of financial instrument and hybrid instrument designated at FVO decreased 845,000 from a loss of 2.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, to a loss of 3.1 million for the same period in 2024 primarily due to fair value adjustments in liability classified warrants and notes payable designated at FVO. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 We have incurred net losses since our inception. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had net losses of 29.0 million and 32.6 million, respectively. We expect to incur additional losses in the near-term future due to significant expenses incurred related to the research and development phase. At September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 336.6 million. We continue our efforts to develop our products and continue the development of our pipeline in the near term and to date, we have generated only limited revenues. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 13.3 million. While we are actively exploring various strategies to optimize our cash flows, we recognize that our current capital resources will be sufficient to fund our operating plan for at least one year from the issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 We have funded our operations primarily through issuing debt and equity securities, in addition to selling our commercial products. Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were generated from the issuance of an aggregate of 6,925,606 shares of common stock under the ATM Agreement for total net proceeds of approximately 27.8 million, and issuance of an aggregate 277,778 common in exchange of License Agreement for total net proceeds of 1.2 million. 
 We expect our expenditures will continue to increase as we continue our efforts to develop our products and continue the development of our pipeline in the near term. We may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. We may also not be successful in entering into partnerships that include payment of upfront licensing fees for our products and product candidates for markets outside the United States, where appropriate. If we do not generate upfront fees from any anticipated arrangements, it would have a negative effect on our operating plan. We still plan to finance our operations and capital funding needs through equity and debt financing as well as revenue from future product sales. However, there can be no assurance that additional funding will be available to us on acceptable terms on a timely basis, if at all, or that we will generate sufficient cash from operations to fund operating needs or ultimately achieve profitability adequately. If we are unable to obtain an adequate level of financing needed for the long-term development and commercialization of our products, we will need to curtail planned activities and reduce costs. Doing so will likely have an adverse effect on our ability to execute on our business plan. 
 Liquidity Management 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company is actively monitoring trends in its capital resources, recognizing favorable and unfavorable developments that may materially impact its financial position. The Company has experienced a slight increase in debt levels due to recent financing activities intended to support operational growth. In contrast, equity levels remain stable, though future fundraising efforts may affect the capital structure. 
 
 The Company expects changes in the mix of capital resources, particularly concerning the relative costs of debt versus equity financing. Current market conditions indicate a trend of rising interest rates, which may increase the cost of future debt issuances. 
 Furthermore, the Company recognizes challenges related to liquidity. It has incurred recurring operating losses and negative cash flows, which raises uncertainties about its future liquidity. The ability to meet current obligations relies on successful ongoing development efforts and securing additional financing. 
 
 61 

Table of Contents 

While the Company plans to finance its operations through equity and/or debt financing, collaboration arrangements, and revenue from future product sales, it currently believes that existing cash balances may not be sufficient to fund its operating plan in the next years. There can be no assurance that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms. 
 To address these liquidity concerns, the Company is committed to pursuing all available avenues for financing and will continuously assess its capital structure and operational needs to ensure financial stability. 
 Comparison of Operating Income and Cash Flow 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s operating cash flows showed a significant improvement over the prior period, primarily due to reductions in cash outflows associated with operating expenses. Operating income, while still negative at a loss of 29.0 million, improved by 3.6 million, or 11 , over the prior period due to a decrease in total operating expenses. This reflects the Company's efforts in cost containment. However, while operating cash flows benefited from these reductions, the ongoing significant variation between operating income and operating cash flows, highlights challenges in achieving cash flow positivity due to high non-cash charges, such as depreciation and stock-based compensation, alongside increased working capital needs to support expanded operations. This variation highlights the Company s strategic focus on managing liquidity to maintain operational stability and pursue growth opportunities effectively. 
 Analysis of Cost of Capital Resources 
 Changes in market conditions may impact our cost of capital resources. Rising interest rates could increase our cost of debt, while seeking equity financing may lead to higher required returns on equity due to potential dilution. We will actively monitor these factors as part of our financial strategy.

Cash Used in Operating Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities of 21.6 million resulted from our net comprehensive loss of 29.1 million, adjusted by the change in fair value of financial instrument and hybrid instrument designated at FVO of 6.9 million, depreciation and amortization expenses of 1.4 million, stock-based compensation of 1.3 million, amortization of operating lease right-of-use asset of 343,000, amortization of debt discounts and debt issuance costs of 274,000, equity in a net loss in the joint venture of 78,000, shares issued in exchange of services 9,000 and partly offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of 2.2 million and gain on extinguishment of debt of 1.2 million. 
 Net cash used in operating activities decreased by 4.2 million from the prior year, indicating improved efficiency. However, cash flows remain insufficient to meet ongoing requirements, underscoring the Company's reliance on alternative funding sources. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities of 25.8 million resulted from our net comprehensive loss of 32.7 million adjusted by the change in fair value of financial instrument and hybrid instrument designated at FVO of 3.4 million, amortization of debt discounts and debt issuance costs of 11.5 million, stock-based compensation of 1.5 million, depreciation and amortization expenses of 1.5 million, amortization of operating lease right-of-use asset of 286,000, shares issued in exchange of services of 166,000, equity in a net loss in the joint venture of 42,000, gain on extinguishment of debt of 3.7 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of 7.8 million.

Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities of 16,000 consisted of a 16,000 purchase of equipment. 
 Cash outflows for investing activities were minimal at 16,000 in 2024, dedicated solely to equipment purchases. This reflects management's commitment to maintaining liquidity, as there were no cash outflows for investing activities in the prior year. 
 No cash is used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Cash Provided by Financing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities of 28.4 million consisted of 27.8 million in net proceeds from shares issued in an At the Market offering, 1.2 million proceeds from the issuance of common shares in exchange of License Agreement, offset by 437,000 repayment of insurance financing, and 100,000 in principal payments of the notes payable. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities increased to 28.4 million in 2024, primarily from an ATM offering and share issuance related to licensing agreement. This trend underscores the Company's ongoing necessity to leverage external financing to address cash flow shortfalls from operations. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities of 23.6 million consisted of 20.8 million in net proceeds from shares issued in an At the Market offering, 1.2 million net proceeds from issuance of warrants in PIPE financing, 611,000 net proceeds from issuance of preferred shares in PIPE financing and noncontrolling interest of 1.2 million, offset by 293,000 repayment of insurance financing, and 50,000 in principal payments of the notes payable.

The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. 
 Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 
 Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(c) under the Exchange Act. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control in future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, using the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework 2013 Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission COSO ). Based on our evaluation using those criteria, our management has concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our internal control over financial

reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP for the reasons discussed above. 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm on our internal control over financial reporting because we are a smaller reporting company and are not subject to auditor attestation requirements under applicable SEC rules. 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have a material adverse effect on us due to defense and settlement costs, diversion of our management resources, and other factors. We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings. 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occur, our business, operating results, financial condition, cash flows, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. 
 The business, financial condition, and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Company s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition, operating results, and stock price. 
 Because of the following factors and other factors affecting the Company s financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. 
 Our royalty interests require us to make minimum royalty payments, even if we do not sell sufficient products to cover such. 
 
 Since March 2020, we have sold royalty interests to certain lenders that entitle such lenders to receive future royalties on sales of our products. These royalty interests require us to make minimum royalty payments beginning in 2021, even if we do not sell a sufficient amount of product to cover such payments, which may strain our cash resources. Total minimum royalty payments, approximately totaling 36.0 million, will commence in 2026. 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 On July 15, 2024, the Company entered into a privately negotiated exchange agreement with a holder of royalty interest in the Company pursuant to which the Company issued 455,000 shares of the Company s common stock, par value 0.0001 to such holder in exchange for a 1,851,850 reduction in the outstanding balance of the royalty interest held by such holder. 
 On July 18, 2024, the Company entered into a privately negotiated exchange agreement with Iliad pursuant to which the Company issued 200,000 shares of the Company s common stock, par value 0.0001 to Iliad in exchange for a 819,600 reduction in the outstanding balance of the royalty interest dated October 8, 2020. 
 The shares of common stock that were issued in the exchange transactions described above were issued in reliance on the exemption from registration provided under Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act. 
 Other than equity securities issued in transactions disclosed above and on our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 10, 2024, and July 16, 2024, there were no unregistered sales of equity securities during the period. 
 Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities
