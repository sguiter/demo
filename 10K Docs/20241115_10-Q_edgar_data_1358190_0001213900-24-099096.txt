per share (the Common Stock ), at a ratio of (the Reverse Stock Split ).
The Reverse Stock Split become effective on July 7, 2022 (the Effective Date ), and the shares began trading on the split-adjusted
basis on the NYSE American under the Company s existing trading symbol ITP at market open on July 8, 2022. The new
CUSIP number following the Reverse Stock Split is 46527C 209. All references made to share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements and applicable disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Reverse Stock Split. 

On
October 29, 2007, pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger (the Merger Agreement ), the Company acquired DongfangZhiye
Holding Limited Dongfang Holding ), a corporation formed on November 13, 2006 under the laws of the British Virgin Islands,
and issued the shareholders of Dongfang Holding an aggregate of (as adjusted for a four-for-one reverse stock split effected
in November 2009) shares of our common stock, which shares were distributed pro-rata to the shareholders of Dongfang Holding in accordance
with their respective ownership interests in Dongfang Holding. At the time of the Merger Agreement, Dongfang Holding owned all of the
issued and outstanding stock and ownership of Dongfang Paper and such shares of Dongfang Paper were held in trust with Zhenyong Liu,
Xiaodong Liu and Shuangxi Zhao, for Mr. Liu, Mr. Liu and Mr. Zhao (the original shareholders of Dongfang Paper) to exercise control over
the disposition of Dongfang Holding s shares in Dongfang Paper on Dongfang Holding s behalf until Dongfang Holding successfully
completed the change in registration of Dongfang Paper s capital with the relevant PRC Administration of Industry and Commerce
as the owner of Dongfang Paper s shares. As a result of the merger transaction, Dongfang Holding became a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company, and Dongfang Holding s wholly owned subsidiary, Dongfang Paper, became an indirectly owned subsidiary of the Company. 

Dongfang
Holding, as the owner of Dongfang Paper, was unable to complete the registration of Dongfang Paper s capital under its name
within the proper time limits set forth under PRC law. In connection with the consummation of the restructuring transactions described
below, Dongfang Holding directed the trustees to return the shares of Dongfang Paper to their original shareholders, and the original
Dongfang Paper shareholders entered into certain agreements with Baoding Shengde Paper Co., Ltd. Baoding Shengde to transfer
the control of Dongfang Paper over to Baoding Shengde. 

On
June 24, 2009, the Company consummated a number of restructuring transactions pursuant to which it acquired all of the issued and outstanding
shares of Shengde Holdings Inc., a Nevada corporation. Shengde Holdings Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 25,
2009. On June 1, 2009, Shengde Holdings Inc. incorporated Baoding Shengde, a limited liability company organized under the laws of the
PRC. Because Baoding Shengde is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shengde Holdings Inc., it is regarded as a wholly foreign-owned entity under
PRC law.

(subsequently increased to in June 2010). Baoding Shengde is mainly engaged
in production and distribution of digital photo paper and single-use face masks and is owned by Shengde Holdings. Prior to February
10, 2010, the Contractual Agreements included (i) Exclusive Technical Service and Business Consulting Agreement, which generally provides
that Baoding Shengde shall provide exclusive technical, business and management consulting services to Dongfang Paper, in exchange for
service fees including a fee equivalent to of Dongfang Paper s total annual net profits; (ii) Loan Agreement, which provides
that Baoding Shengde will make a loan in the aggregate principal amount of to Dongfang Paper Equity Owners in exchange for
each such shareholder agreeing to contribute all of its proceeds from the loan to the registered capital of Dongfang Paper; (iii) Call
Option Agreement, which generally provides, among other things, that Dongfang Paper Equity Owners irrevocably grant to Baoding Shengde
an option to purchase all or part of each owner s equity interest in Dongfang Paper. The exercise price for the options shall be
RMB which Baoding Shengde should pay to each of Dongfang Paper Equity Owner for all their equity interests in Dongfang Paper; (iv) Share
Pledge Agreement, which provides that Dongfang Paper Equity Owners will pledge all of their equity interests in Dongfang Paper to Baoding
Shengde as security for their obligations under the other agreements described in this section. Specifically, Baoding Shengde is entitled
to dispose of the pledged equity interests in the event that Dongfang Paper Equity Owners breach their obligations under the Loan Agreement
or Dongfang Paper fails to pay the service fees to Baoding Shengde pursuant to the Exclusive Technical Service and Business Consulting
Agreement; and (v) Proxy Agreement, which provides that Dongfang Paper Equity Owners shall irrevocably entrust a designee of Baoding
Shengde with such shareholder s voting rights and the right to represent such shareholder to exercise such owner s rights
at any equity owners meeting of Dongfang Paper or with respect to any equity owner action to be taken in accordance with the laws
and Dongfang Paper s Articles of Association. The terms of the agreement are binding on the parties for as long as Dongfang Paper
Equity Owners continue to hold any equity interest in Dongfang Paper. A Dongfang Paper Equity Owner will cease to be a party to the agreement
once it transfers its equity interests with the prior approval of Baoding Shengde. As the Company had controlled Dongfang Paper since
July 16, 2007 through Dongfang Holding and the trust until June 24, 2009 and continued to control Dongfang Paper through Baoding Shengde
and the Contractual Agreements, the execution of the Contractual Agreements is considered as a business combination under common control. 

On
February 10, 2010, Baoding Shengde and the Dongfang Paper Equity Owners entered into a Termination of Loan Agreement to terminate the
above- mentioned Loan Agreement. Because of the Company s decision to fund future business expansions through Baoding
Shengde instead of Dongfang Paper, the loan contemplated was never made prior to the point of termination. The parties believe
the termination of the Loan Agreement does not in itself compromise the effective control of the Company over Dongfang Paper and its
businesses in the PRC. 

An
agreement was also entered into among Baoding Shengde, Dongfang Paper and the Dongfang Paper Equity Owners on December 31, 2010, reiterating
that Baoding Shengde is entitled to of the distributable profit of Dongfang Paper, pursuant to the above- mentioned Contractual
Agreements. In addition, Dongfang Paper and the Dongfang Paper Equity Owners shall not declare any of Dongfang Paper s unappropriated
earnings as dividend, including the unappropriated earnings of Dongfang Paper from its establishment to 2010 and thereafter. 

On
June 25, 2019, Dongfang Paper entered into an acquisition agreement with the shareholder of Tengsheng Paper Co., Ltd. Tengsheng
Paper ), a limited liability company organized under the laws of the PRC, pursuant to which Dongfang Paper would acquire Tengsheng
Paper. Full payment of the consideration in the amount of RMB million (approximately million) was made on February 23, 2022. 

QianrongQianhui
Hebei Technology Co., Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Shengde holding, was incorporated on July 15, 2021. It is a service provider
of high quality material solutions for textile, cosmetics and paper production.

However,
uncertainties in the PRC legal system could cause the Company s current ownership structure to be found to be in violation of any
existing and/or future PRC laws or regulations and could limit the Company s ability, through its subsidiary, to enforce its rights
under these contractual arrangements. Furthermore, shareholders of the VIE may have interests that are different than those of the Company,
which could potentially increase the risk that they would seek to act contrary to the terms of the aforementioned agreements. 

In
addition, if the current structure or any of the contractual arrangements were found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC
law, the Company may be subject to penalties, which may include, but not be limited to, the cancellation or revocation of the Company s
business and operating licenses, being required to restructure the Company s operations or being required to discontinue the Company s
operating activities. The imposition of any of these or other penalties may result in a material and adverse effect on the Company s
ability to conduct its operations. In such case, the Company may not be able to operate or control the VIE, which may result in deconsolidation
of the VIE. The Company believes the possibility that it will no longer be able to control and consolidate its VIE will occur as a result
of the aforementioned risks and uncertainties is remote.

Total Income Tax Expenses (Benefits) 

In addition to the reversible future PRC income
tax benefits stemming from the timing differences of items such as recognition of asset disposal gain or loss and asset depreciation,
the Company was incorporated in the United States and incurred net operating losses of approximately and for U.S. income
tax purposes for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The net operating loss carried forward may be available to
reduce future years taxable income. 
As of September 30, 2024, management believed that the realization of all the U.S. income tax benefits from these losses, which generally
would generate a deferred tax asset if it can be expected to be utilized in the future, appears not more than likely due to the Company s
limited operating history and continuing losses for United States income tax purposes. Accordingly, As of September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023, the Company provided a valuation allowance on the U.S. deferred tax asset benefit to reduce the total deferred tax asset
to the amount realizable for the PRC income tax purposes. Management reviews this valuation allowance periodically and will make adjustments
as warranted.

As of September 30, 2024, except for the one-time
transition tax under the 2017 TCJA which imposes a U.S. tax liability on all unrepatriated foreign E Ps, the Company does not believe
that its future dividend policy and the available U.S. tax deductions and net operating losses will cause the Company to recognize any
other substantial current U.S. federal or state corporate income tax liability in the near future. Nor does it believe that the amount
of the repatriation of the VIE s earnings and profits for purposes of paying dividends will change the Company s position
that its PRC subsidiary Baoding Shengde and the VIE, Dongfang Paper are considered or are expected to be indefinitely reinvested offshore
to support our future capacity expansion. If these earnings are repatriated to the U.S. resulting in U.S. taxable income in the future,
or if it is determined that such earnings are to be remitted in the foreseeable future, additional tax provisions would be required. 

The Company has adopted ASC Topic 740-10-05, Income
Taxes. To date, the adoption of this interpretation has not impacted the Company s financial position, results of operations, or
cash flows. The Company performed self-assessment and the Company s liability for income taxes includes the liability for unrecognized
tax benefits, interest and penalties which relate to tax years still subject to review by taxing authorities. Audit periods remain open
for review until the statute of limitations has passed, which in the PRC is usually years. The completion of review or the expiration
of the statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to the Company s liability for income taxes.
Any such adjustment could be material to the Company s results of operations for any given quarterly or annual period based, in
part, upon the results of operations for the given period. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, management considered that
the Company had no uncertain tax positions affecting its consolidated financial position and results of operations or cash flows, and
will continue to evaluate for any uncertain position in future. There are no estimated interest costs and penalties provided in the Company s
consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company s
tax positions related to open tax years are subject to examination by the relevant tax authorities and the major one is the China Tax
Authority.

Our average unit purchase costs (net of applicable
value added tax) of recycled paper board in the three months ended September 30, 2024 were RMB 1,214/tonne (approximately 171/tonne),
as compared to RMB 1,239/tonne (approximately 176/tonne) for the three months ended September 30, 2023. These changes (in US dollars)
represent a year-over-year decrease of 2.84 for the recycled paper board. We use domestic recycled paper (sourced mainly from the Beijing-Tianjin

domestic recycled paper, our experience suggests that the pricing of domestic recycled paper bears some correlation to the pricing of
imported recycled paper.

in the amount of 1,160,996 during the nine months of 2024. There was also an increase of 2,108,280 in the ending inventory balance as

the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net cash outflow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was mainly for repayment of
bank loans.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The Company s financial statements are prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management makes these estimates using the
best information available at the time the estimates are made. However, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The
most critical accounting policies are listed below: 

Revenue Recognition Policy 

The Company recognizes revenue when goods are
delivered and a formal arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, the delivery is completed, no other significant obligations
of the Company exist, and collectability is reasonably assured. Goods are considered delivered when the customer s truck picks up
goods at our finished goods inventory warehouse. 

Long-Lived Assets 

The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived
assets and the related estimated remaining useful lives when events or circumstances lead management to believe that the carrying value
of an asset may not be recoverable and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets 
carrying amount. In such circumstances, those assets are written down to estimated fair value. Our judgments regarding the existence of
impairment indicators are based on market conditions, assumptions for operational performance of our businesses, and possible government
policy toward operating efficiency of the Chinese paper manufacturing industry. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
no events or circumstances occurred for which an evaluation of the recoverability of long-lived assets was required. We are currently
not aware of any events or circumstances that may indicate any need to record such impairment in the future. 

Foreign Currency Translation 

The functional currency of Dongfang Paper and
Baoding Shengde is the Chinese Yuan Renminbi RMB ). Under ASC Topic 830-30, all assets and liabilities are translated into
United States dollars using the current exchange rate at the end of each fiscal period. The current exchange rates used by the Company
as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 to translate the Chinese RMB to the U.S. Dollars are 7.0074:1 and 7.0827:1, respectively.
Revenues and expenses are translated using the prevailing average exchange rates at 7.0999:1 and 7.0341:1 for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Translation adjustments are included in other comprehensive income (loss). 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We were the guarantor for Baoding Huanrun Trading
Co., for its long-term bank loans in an amount of 4,423,895 (RMB31,000,000), which matures at various times in 2028. Baoding Huanrun
Trading Co. is one of our major suppliers of raw materials. This helps us to maintain a good relationship with the supplier and negotiate
for better terms in payment for materials. If Huanrun Trading Co. were to become insolvent, the Company could be materially adversely
affected. Except as aforesaid, we have no material off-balance sheet transactions.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09,
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. Under this ASU, public entities must annually (1) disclose specific
categories in the rate reconciliation and (2) provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold
(if the effect of those reconciling items is equal to or greater than five percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income
or loss by the applicable statutory income tax rate). This ASU s amendments are effective for all entities that are subject to Topic
740, Income Taxes, for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the
impact of this pronouncement on our disclosures. 

In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08,
Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2021-08),
which clarifies that an acquirer of a business should recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination
in accordance with Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The new amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments should be applied prospectively to business combinations
occurring on or after the effective date of the amendments, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of
this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 

Foreign Exchange Risk 

While our reporting currency
is the US dollar, almost all of our consolidated revenues and consolidated costs and expenses are denominated in RMB. All of our assets
are denominated in RMB except for some cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivables. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange
risks as our revenues and results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between US dollar and RMB. If the
RMB depreciates against the US dollar, the value of our RMB revenues, earnings and assets as expressed in our US dollar financial statements
will decline. We have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign exchange risk. 

Inflation 

Although we are generally able to pass along minor
incremental cost inflation to our customers, inflation such as increases in the costs of our products and overhead costs may adversely
affect our operating results. We do not believe that inflation in China has had a material impact on our financial position or results
of operations to date, however, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels
of gross margin and selling and distribution, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if the selling prices
of our products do not increase in line with the increased costs. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

As required by Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange
Act, as amended (the Exchange Act ), we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls
and procedures, which were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. This evaluation was carried out under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer.
Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024,
our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level to ensure (1) that information required to be
disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time
periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (2) information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or
submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes with respect to our internal
control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting in the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024.

In February 17, 2022, FT Global Capital, Inc. FTG ), filed a lawsuit against the Company in the Commercial Division of New York Supreme Court (the Court ).
FTG has brought a breach of contract action against the Company to recover fees in connection with an agreement that the parties entered
into in April 2019 (the Agreement ). The Company has answered FTG s complaint and has denied the allegations because
it is the Company s position that FTG did not fulfill its obligations under the terms of the Agreement. Discovery is continuing.
The Court issued a Status Conference Order (the Order dated April 15, 2024. According to the Order, the Court ordered that
the Company has failed to appear and is in default, and that pursuant to the warning given in the Court s order dated March 22,
2024, the Company s default renders its answer subject to being stricken, and accordingly the answer of the Company was stricken.
On April 18, 2024, FT Global filed a notice of motion for default judgment against the Company. By an order dated August 20, 2024, the Court granted the plaintiff s default motion on the issue of liability, with damages to be
determined by a referee. The Company then moved to vacate the order dated August 20, 2024, but the Court denied the Company s motion
on November 1, 2024, stating that the excuse proffered by the Company as to the reason it did not retain counsel in a timely fashion was
not sufficient. 

In November 2023, an individual plaintiff involved
in a civil loan dispute filed a lawsuit against the defendants including Tengsheng Paper and Jie Ping, who served as the executive director
and the legal representative of Tengsheng Paper, at the Lianchi District People s Court of Baoding City, China (the PRC Court ).
On December 1, 2023, the plaintiff sought property preservation measures, requesting the PRC Court to freeze RMB3.35 million worth of
bank deposits held by Jie Ping and Tengsheng Paper. Following this request, on the same day, the PRC Court issued a ruling to immediately
freeze the RMB3.35 million worth of bank deposits of Jie Ping and Tengsheng Paper. On June 14, 2024, the PRC Court ordered the defendants
to repay the principal of the loan in the amount of RMB3,320,000 to the plaintiff, and Tengsheng Paper was jointly liable for repayment. 

The ultimate resolution of the proceedings may
have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Failure to settle the proceedings
or other unfavorable outcomes in this proceedings could result in significant damages, additional penalties or other remedies imposed
against the Company. Litigation of this kind could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and
resources. It could also result in our reputation being harmed and our stock price could decline as a result of allegations made in the
course of the proceedings, regardless of the truthfulness of the allegations.
