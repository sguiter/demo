Transaction costs amounted to consisting of of underwriting fees, of deferred underwriting fees and of other offering costs (which includes of Representative Shares (as defined in Note 6) at fair value. See Note 6). 

The Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Units, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. The Company s initial Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least of the balance in the Trust Account (as defined below) (less any deferred underwriting commissions and net of amounts previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations) at the time of the signing of an agreement to enter into a Business Combination. The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination. 

The Company will provide its holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The stockholders will be entitled to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (initially 10.00 per share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations).

The Company will proceed with a Business Combination if a majority of the outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a stockholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the Charter ), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Company s Sponsor has agreed to (a) vote its Insider Shares (as defined in Note 5), Private Shares and any Public Shares held by it in favor of a Business Combination and (b) not to redeem any shares in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a Business Combination or sell any such shares to the Company in a tender offer in connection with a Business Combination. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. 

Notwithstanding the above, if the Company seeks stockholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Charter provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 20 or more of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company. 

The Sponsor has agreed to (i) waive its redemption rights with respect to Insider Shares, Private Shares and any Public Shares it may acquire during or after the Initial Public Offering in connection with the consummation of a Business Combination and (ii) not to propose an amendment to the Company s Charter that would affect the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to redeem 100 of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination, unless the Company provides the public stockholders an opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment. However, the Sponsor will be entitled to liquidating distributions with respect to any Public Shares acquired if the Company fails to consummate a Business Combination or liquidates within the period of time for the Company to complete a Business Combination (the Combination Period ).

The Company also requested the Staff to provide an exception, to October 14, 2024, to allow the Company to regain compliance with the Listing Rule. 

On October 4, 2024, the Company filed the June 30, 2024 10-Q with the SEC. On October 30, 2024, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq stating that the Company had regained compliance with the Listing Rule and that the matter is now closed. 

On November 8, 2024, the Company held an annual meeting of stockholders (the Annual Meeting ), in which the stockholders approved Amendment No. 4 to the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the Charter ). This amendment extends the deadline for completing an initial business combination to November 16, 2025. In connection with the Annual Meeting, shares of the Company s publicly traded common stock were tendered for redemption. 

If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining stockholders and the Company s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to the Company s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. 

The Sponsor has agreed to waive its liquidation rights with respect to the Private Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Sponsor or any of its respective affiliates acquire Public Shares after the Initial Public Offering, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Initial Public Offering price per Unit 10.00). 

In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) 10.00 per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than 10.00 per Public Share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account nor will it apply to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. 

Risks and Uncertainties 

Management continues to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus could have a negative effect on the Company s financial position, results of its operations, and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

In February 2022, the Russian Federation and Belarus commenced a military action with the country of Ukraine. As a result of this action, various nations, including the United States, have instituted economic sanctions against the Russian Federation and Belarus. Separately, in October 2023, Israel and certain Iranian-backed Palestinian forces began an armed conflict in Israel, the Gaza Strip, and surrounding areas, which threatens to spread to other Middle Eastern countries including Lebanon and Iran. The impact of these conflicts and related sanctions on the world economy are not determinable as of the date of these financial statements. The specific impact on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows is also not determinable as of the date of these financial statements. 

On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IR Act was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new U.S. federal 1 excise tax on certain repurchases (including redemptions) of stock by publicly traded domestic (i.e., U.S.) corporations and certain domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1 of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax. The IR Act applies only to repurchases that occur after December 31, 2022. 

Any redemption or other repurchase that occurs after December 31, 2022, in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise, may be subject to the excise tax. Whether and to what extent the Company would be subject to the excise tax in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise would depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value of the redemptions and repurchases in connection with the Business Combination, extension or otherwise, (ii) the structure of a Business Combination, (iii) the nature and amount of any PIPE or other equity issuances in connection with a Business Combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with a Business Combination but issued within the same taxable year of a Business Combination) and (iv) the content of regulations and other guidance from the Treasury. In addition, because the excise tax would be payable by the Company and not by the redeeming holder, the mechanics of any required payment of the excise tax have not been determined. The foregoing could cause a reduction in the cash available on hand to complete a Business Combination and in the Company s ability to complete a Business Combination. 

During the second quarter of 2024, the Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations with respect to the timing and payment of the excise tax. These regulations provided that the filing and payment deadline for any liability incurred during the period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 would be October 31, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating its options with respect to this obligation. Any amount of such excise tax not paid in full, will be subject to additional interest and penalties which are currently estimated at interest per annum and a underpayment penalty per month or portion of a month up to of the total liability for any amount that is unpaid from November 1, 2024 until paid in full. 

On May 12, 2023, the Company s stockholders elected to redeem shares for a total of . On August 21, 2023, the Company s stockholders elected to redeem shares for a total of . The Company evaluated the classification and accounting of the share/ stock redemption under ASC 450, Contingencies . ASC 450 states that when a loss contingency exists the likelihood that the future event(s) will confirm the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability can range from probable to remote. A contingent liability must be reviewed at each reporting period to determine appropriate treatment. The Company evaluated the current status and probability of completing a Business Combination as of September 30, 2024 and concluded that it is probable that a contingent liability should be recorded. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company recorded of excise tax liability calculated as 1 of the shares redeemed. 

Going Concern 

In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board FASB Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, the Company has until November 16, 2025 to consummate the proposed Business Combination, provided that the Company deposits into the Trust Account an amount equal to per outstanding Public Share for each three-month extension commencing on November 17, 2023. It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate the proposed Business Combination by this time. If a Business Combination is not consummated by this date, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company. Management has determined that the liquidity condition and mandatory liquidation, should a Business Combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution, raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after November 16, 2025. The Company intends to complete the proposed Business Combination before the mandatory liquidation date. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to consummate any Business Combination by November 16, 2025.

The Company s officers, directors and Sponsor may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company s working capital needs. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction, and reducing overhead expenses. The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.

Results of Operations 

We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from April 8, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2024 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering, described below, and identifying a target company for a Business Combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our Business Combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 130,870, which consists of operating costs of 202,182, offset by interest income on investment held in the Trust Account of 76,529 and provision for income taxes of 5,217. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net loss of 1,932,911, which consists of general and administrative expenses of 1,988,611, interest expense of 2,074 and provision for income taxes of 13,790, offset by interest earned on investments held in the Trust Account of 71,564. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 220,998, which consists of general and administrative expenses of 431,169, interest expense of 1,402 and provision for income taxes of 39,630, offset by interest earned on investments held in the Trust Account of 225,179 and forgiveness of debt of 26,024.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

On November 16, 2021, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 6,000,000 Units and, with respect to the shares of Common Stock included in the Units sold, the Public Shares at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 60,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the sale of 205,000 Private Units at a price of 10.00 per Private Unit in a private placement to the Sponsor generating gross proceeds of 2,050,000. 

On November 18, 2021, the underwriters fully exercised their over-allotment option, resulting in an additional 900,000 Units issued for an aggregate amount of 9,000,000. In connection with the underwriters full exercise of their over-allotment option, the Company also consummated the sale of an additional 18,000 Private Units at 10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of 180,000. A net total of 9,000,000 was deposited into the Trust Account, bringing the aggregate proceeds held in the Trust Account to 69,000,000. 

Following the full exercise of the over-allotment option, and the sale of the Private Units, a total of 69,000,000 was placed in the Trust Account. We incurred transactions costs amounting to 5,090,361 consisting of 1,380,000 of underwriting fees, 2,070,000 of deferred underwriting fees and 1,640,361 of other offering costs. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 611,362. Net loss of 220,998 was affected by interest earned on investments held in the Trust Account of 225,179, and forgiveness of debt of 26,024. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used 139,161 of cash for operating activities. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in operating activities was 377,362. Net loss of 2,182,359 was affected by interest earned on investments held in the Trust Account of 437,409. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided 2,242,406 of cash for operating activities. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 5,994,370 (including 512,880 of interest income) consisting of money market funds with a maturity of 185 days or less. Interest income on the balance in the Trust Account may be used by us to pay taxes. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have not withdrawn any of the interest earned on the Trust Account. 

We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account (less income taxes payable), to complete our Business Combination. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 46,054 held outside the Trust Account for general working capital purposes. In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor, or certain of our officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete a Business Combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. 

On February 15, 2023, the Company issued a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of 300,000 (the Note to the Sponsor. Pursuant to the Note, the Sponsor loaned the Company an aggregate amount of 300,000 that is due and payable upon the Company s consummation of an initial Business Combination with a target business. The Note will either be paid upon consummation of the Company s initial Business Combination, or, at the Sponsor s discretion, converted upon consummation of the Company s Business Combination into private units at a price of 10.00 per unit. The loan will be forgiven, except to the extent of any funds held outside of the trust account, by the Sponsor or its affiliates if the Company is unable to consummate an initial Business Combination during the Combination Period. On May 16, 2023, the Company and the Sponsor entered into an amendment to the Note, pursuant to which the Note and the forgiveness term was extended from May 16, 2023 to November 16, 2024. On September 13, 2023, as approved by the Company s audit committee, the Company entered into a note conversion agreement with the Sponsor, to convert the Note into 75,000 shares of the Company s Common Stock. Accordingly, the Company satisfied the Note in exchange for the issuance of 75,000 shares of Common Stock.

On March 31, 2023, the Company and UHY Advisors/UHY LLP, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, entered into an unsecured promissory note for services rendered and unpaid in the principal sum of One Hundred Eight Thousand One Dollars and Ninety Cents 108,001), plus interest applied monthly on any un-paid balance at the rate of eight (8 percent per year until such sum is fully paid. On August 21, 2023, the Company and UHY Advisors/UHY LLP extended the due date of promissory note to October 31, 2023. If 102,877 is paid in full on this promissory note no later than October 31, 2023, all accrued finance charges on this promissory note will be forgiven. The promissory note is payable by the Company in advance without penalty. 5,125 of the balance was waived as agreed with UHY LLP. On November 6, 2023, the Company and UHY Advisors/UHY LLP further amended the promissory note by reducing the unpaid principal sum to 58,001 and extending the due date of the promissory note to January 31, 2024. On April 30, 2024, UHY Advisors/UHY LLP has agreed to extinguish a total of 179,035 of liabilities to UHY Advisors/UHY LLP and all interest accrued of 6,989 for a settlement amount of 160,000. As of September 30, 2024, there was 0 outstanding under this note and 0 accrued interest payable in the accompanying balance sheets. 

On May 16, 2023, the Company and the Sponsor entered into an amendment to the Note, pursuant to which the Note and the forgiveness term was extended from May 16, 2023 to November 16, 2024. On September 13, 2023, as approved by the Company s audit committee, the Company entered into a note conversion agreement (the Note Conversion Agreement with the Sponsor, to convert the Note into 75,000 shares of the Company s Common Stock. Accordingly, the Company satisfied the Note in exchange for the issuance of 75,000 shares of Common Stock (Note 6). 

On October 30, 2023, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note in the aggregate principal amount up to 400,000 (the 2023 Note to the Company s Sponsor. Pursuant to the 2023 Note, the Sponsor agreed to loan to the Company an aggregate amount up to 400,000 that may be drawn down by the Company from time to time by written notice to the Sponsor. The aggregate amount advanced under the 2023 Note is due payable by the Company on the earlier of: (i) the date on which Company consummates an initial Business Combination with a target business, or (ii) the date the Company liquidates if a Business Combination is not consummated. The 2023 Note does not bear interest. In the event that the Company does not consummate a Business Combination, the Note will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the Company s trust account, if any. The proceeds of the 2023 Note will be used by the Company for working capital purposes. 

On April 3, 2024, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note in the aggregate principal amount up to 300,000 (the 2024 Note and together with the 2023 Note, the Notes to the Sponsor.

The aggregate amount advanced under the 2024 Note is due payable by the Company on the earlier of: (i) the date on which Company consummates an initial business combination with a target business, or (ii) the date the Company liquidates if a business combination is not consummated. The 2024 Note does not bear interest. In the event that the Company does not consummate a business combination, the 2024 Note will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the Company s trust account, if any. The proceeds of the 2024 Note will be used by the Company for working capital purposes. 

On April 19, 2024, as approved by the Company s audit committee, the Company entered into a note conversion agreement (the Note Conversion Agreement with the Sponsor, to convert the Principal Amount due under the Notes into 150,000 shares of the Company s common stock, par value 0.0001 per share (the Common Stock (See Note 6). 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were 0 and 200,000 outstanding amounts under the Notes, respectively. 

On April 30, 2024, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note in the aggregate principal amount up to 300,000 (the April 2024 Note to the Sponsor. Pursuant to the April 2024 Note, the Sponsor agreed to loan to the Company an aggregate amount up to 300,000 that may be drawn down by the Company from time to time by written notice to the Sponsor.

34 

On August 14, 2024, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note in the aggregate principal amount up to 500,000 (the August 2024 Note to the Sponsor. Pursuant to the August 2024 Note, the Sponsor agreed to loan to the Company an aggregate amount up to 500,000 that may be drawn down by the Company from time to time by written notice to the Sponsor. The aggregate amount advanced under the August 2024 Note is due payable by the Company on the earlier of: (i) the date on which Company consummates an initial business combination with a target business, or (ii) the date the Company liquidates if a business combination is not consummated. The August 2024 Note does not bear interest. In the event that the Company does not consummate a business combination, the August 2024 Note will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the Company s trust account, if any. As of September 30, 2024, there was 150,000 outstanding amount under this August 2024 Note. 

On October 8, 2024 and November 8, 2024, the Company borrowed an additional 92,000 and 58,000 under the August 2024 Note, resulting
to a total of 300,000 drawn from the August 2024 Note as of the date of filing of these financial statements. 

If our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a Business Combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our Business Combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our Business Combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our Public Shares upon consummation of our Business Combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. 

Going Concern 

As of the date of the filing of this Quarterly report on form 10-Q, the Company extended the time it has to complete its initial Business Combination from February 16, 2024 to November 16, 2025 by depositing 51,932 each on February 16, 2024, May 15, 2024 and August 15, 2024 into its trust account. 

We have until November 16, 2025 to consummate a Business Combination, provided that the Company deposits into the trust account an amount equal to 0.10 per outstanding Public Share for each three-month extension commencing on November 17, 2023. It is uncertain that we will be able to consummate a Business Combination by this time. If a Business Combination is not consummated by this date, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution. Management has determined that the liquidity condition and mandatory liquidation, should a Business Combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should we be required to liquidate after November 16, 2025. 

Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements 

We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. 

Contractual Obligations 

We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to pay an affiliates, or advisors a total of up to 10,000 per month for office space, utilities, out of pocket expenses, and secretarial and administrative support. The arrangement will terminate upon the earlier of the Company s consummation of a Business Combination or its liquidation. 

The underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of 0.30 per unit, or 2,070,000 in the aggregate will be payable to the underwriters for deferred underwriting commissions. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies: 

35 

Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption 

We account for our Common Stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable Common Stock (including Common Stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, Common Stock is classified as stockholders equity. Our Common Stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, the Common Stock subject to possible redemption is presented as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders equity section of our balance sheets. 

Net Loss per Common Share 

We comply with accounting and disclosure requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB ASC 260, Earnings Per Share. The statement of operations include a presentation of loss per redeemable public share and loss per non-redeemable share following the two-class method of loss per share. In order to determine the net loss attributable to both the public redeemable shares and non-redeemable shares, we first considered the total loss allocable to both sets of shares. This is calculated using the total net loss less any dividends paid. For purposes of calculating net loss per share, any remeasurement of the accretion to redemption value of the common shares subject to possible redemption was considered to be dividends paid to our public stockholders. Subsequent to calculating the total loss allocable to both sets of shares, we split the amount to be allocated using a ratio of 16 for the Public Shares and 84 for the non-redeemable shares for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, reflective of the respective participation rights. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any dilutive securities and other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into common shares and then share in our earnings. As a result, diluted loss per share is the same as basic loss per share for the periods presented. 

Recent Accounting Standards 

In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) ASU 2020-06 to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entity s own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entity s own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. As a smaller reporting company, ASU 2020-06 is effective December 1, 2024 for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and should be applied on a full or modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted beginning on January 1, 2021. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2023. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 did not have a material impact on the Company s financial statements and disclosures. 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09), which requires disclosure of incremental income tax information within the rate reconciliation and expanded disclosures of income taxes paid, among other disclosure requirements. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company s management does not believe the adoption of ASU 2023-09 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 

Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our financial statements. 

36 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Not required for smaller reporting companies. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including Dr. Suying Liu, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, Dr. Suying Liu, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon his evaluation, he concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) were not effective. 

During the audit of the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, management has identified material weaknesses in internal controls due to the restatements to our December 31, 2022, March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023 financial statements restatements regarding the improper classification of the Investment held in Trust Account and Deferred underwriting fee payable as current asset and liability, respectively, in our financial statements and the errors in earnings (loss) per share. In addition, the material weaknesses identified in December 31, 2023 financial reporting includes improper recognition of an invoice received which is identified during the review of the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. 

Additionally, during the review of the Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2024, management has identified a material weakness in internal controls due to the Company s inability to timely file the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as well as the subsequent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024. On October 4, 2024, the Company filed the June 30, 2024 10-Q with the SEC. On October 30, 2024, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq stating that the Company had regained compliance with the Listing Rule and that the matter is now closed. 

While we have processes to identify and appropriately apply applicable accounting requirements, we plan to continue to enhance our system of evaluating and implementing the accounting standards that apply to our financial statements, including through enhanced analyses by our personnel and third-party professionals with whom we consult regarding complex accounting applications. The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time, and we can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Other than as discussed above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
