 shares of Series A Cumulative Convertible Participating Preferred Stock, par value per share (the Preferred Stock ), with an aggregate liquidation preference of million, at a purchase price of per share, to CD R Boulder Holdings, L.P. CD R Holdings ). 
 On July 31, 2023 (the Repurchase Date ), the Company repurchased (the Repurchase all issued and outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock held by CD R Holdings (the shares of Preferred Stock held by CD R Holdings, the Shares pursuant to a letter agreement dated July 6, 2023 in cash for million, including million of accrued but unpaid dividends as of such date (the Repurchase Price ). In connection with the Repurchase, CD R Holdings agreed that for as long as Philip Knisely or Nathan Sleeper remained a member of the Company s Board and for a period of six months thereafter, the customary voting, standstill, and transfer restrictions set forth in the original Investment Agreement with respect to the Preferred Stock will continue to apply to CD R Holdings and its related fund in accordance with their terms. Following the closing of the Repurchase, Mr. Sleeper resigned from the Company s Board and Mr. Knisely remained a member of the Company s Board until his resignation on January 23, 2024. 
 The aggregate Repurchase Price and related transaction fees and expenses were financed by a combination of proceeds from the 2030 Senior Notes, which are further described in Note 11, as well as the 2026 ABL (as defined in Note 11), and cash on hand. 
 On and after the Repurchase Date, all dividends and distributions ceased to accrue on the Shares, the repurchased Shares are no longer deemed outstanding, and all rights of CD R Holdings with respect to the repurchased Shares terminated.

million. 
 Before the Repurchase occurred, the Preferred Stock was convertible perpetual participating preferred stock of the Company, and conversion of the Preferred Stock into par value shares of the Company s common stock would have been at a conversion price of per share (or shares of common stock). The Preferred Stock accumulated dividends at a rate of per annum (payable quarterly in cash or in-kind, subject to certain conditions). The Preferred Stock was not mandatorily redeemable; therefore, it was classified as mezzanine equity in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets. Holders of Preferred Stock would have participated in dividends on an as-converted basis if declared on common shares. As a result, Preferred Stock was classified as a participating security and thereby required the allocation of income that would have otherwise been available to common stockholders when calculating net income (loss) per common share. 
 Prior to the Repurchase, CD R Holdings typically reinvested cash proceeds received from the quarterly Preferred Stock dividend payments to purchase shares of the Company s common stock on the open market, the most recent of which occurred in April 2023. In connection with the Repurchase, CD R Holdings triggered the short-swing profit rule pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act and disgorged million in short-swing trading profits to the Company immediately following the Repurchase. Subsequent to the Repurchase, CD R Holdings disgorged an additional million of short-swing trading profits triggered by CD R Holdings public offering to sell million shares of the Company s common stock. The million of short-swing trading profits disgorged by CD R pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were recorded to additional paid-in capital on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 The difference between the total consideration paid for the Repurchase, inclusive of direct costs, and the carrying value of the Preferred Stock, resulted in a million Repurchase premium (the Repurchase Premium which was recorded as a reduction to retained earnings within the condensed consolidated statement of stockholders equity. In calculating basic and diluted net income (loss) per common share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Repurchase Premium is included as a component of net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders. 
 For periods in which Preferred Stock is outstanding, diluted net income (loss) per common share is calculated by utilizing the most dilutive result of the if-converted and two-class methods. In both methods, net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders and the weighted-average common shares outstanding are adjusted to account for the impact of the assumed issuance of potential common shares that are dilutive, subject to dilution sequencing rules.

Market conditions are incorporated into the grant date fair value of the management awards with market conditions using a Monte Carlo valuation model.

For awards with performance conditions, the actual number of awards that will vest can range from to of the original grant amount, depending upon actual Company performance below or above the established performance metric targets. At each reporting date, the Company estimates performance in relation to the defined targets when determining the projected number of management awards with performance conditions that are expected to vest and calculating the related stock-based compensation expense. Management awards with performance conditions are amortized over the service period if, and to the extent that, it is determined that achievement of the performance condition is probable. If awards with market, performance and/or service conditions are forfeited due to failure to achieve performance conditions or failure to satisfy service conditions, any previously recognized expense for such awards is reversed. 
 RSUs granted to non-employee directors are subject to continued service and vest on the first anniversary of the grant date (except under certain conditions). Generally, the common shares underlying the RSUs are not eligible for distribution until the non-employee director s service on the Board has terminated, and for non-employee director RSU grants made prior to fiscal year 2014, the share distribution date is six months after the director s termination of service on the Board. Any non-employee directors who have Beacon equity holdings (defined as common stock and outstanding vested equity awards) with a total fair value that is greater than or equal to five times the annual Board cash retainer may elect to have any future RSU grants settle simultaneously with vesting.

The applicable margin for the 2028 Term Loan ranged, depending on the Company s consolidated total leverage ratio (consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA, each as defined in the 2028 Term Loan credit agreement), from to per annum in the case of base rate borrowings and to per annum in the case of Term SOFR borrowings. 
 On March 28, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 3 to the 2028 Term Loan (the 2028 Term Loan Amendment No. 3 with Citi, as administrative agent and collateral agent, and the lenders party thereto.

 interest rate swap agreements to manage the interest rate risk associated with the variable rate on the Company s previous term loan. Each swap agreement has a notional amount of million. As part of the 2021 Debt Refinancing, the Company refinanced its previous term loan, resulting in the issuance of the 2028 Term Loan; the interest rate swaps were designed and executed such that they continue to hedge against a total notional amount of million related to the refinanced 2028 Term Loan. One agreement (the -year swap was scheduled to expire on August 30, 2024 and swaps the thirty-day LIBOR with a fixed-rate of . The second agreement (the -year swap expired on August 30, 2022 and swapped the thirty-day LIBOR with a fixed-rate of . At the inception of the swap agreements, the Company determined that both swaps qualified for cash flow hedge accounting under ASC 815. Therefore, changes in the fair value of the swaps, net of taxes, were recognized in other comprehensive income each period, then reclassified into the condensed consolidated statements of operations as a component of interest expense, financing costs and other, net in the period in which the hedged transaction affected earnings. 
 On March 16, 2023, the Company novated its -year swap agreement to another counterparty and, in connection with such novation, amended the interest rate swap agreement. The amendment changed the index rate from LIBOR to SOFR, increased the total notional 
 22 

million, and extended the termination date to March 31, 2027 (the 2027 interest rate swap ). Specifically, the fixed rate of indexed to LIBOR was modified to indexed to SOFR. The Company used a strategy commonly referred to as blend and extend which allows the asset position of the novated -year swap agreement of approximately million to be effectively blended into the new 2027 interest rate swap agreement. As a result of this transaction, on March 16, 2023, the -year swap agreement was de-designated and the unrealized gain of million included within accumulated other comprehensive income was frozen and was ratably reclassified as a reduction to interest expense, financing costs and other, net over the original term of the -year swap, or through August 30, 2024 as the hedged transactions affect earnings. The unrealized gain of million was fully recognized as of September 30, 2024. Additionally, the 2027 interest rate swap had a fair value of million at inception and will be ratably recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to interest expense, financing costs and other, net over the term of the 2027 interest rate swap, or through March 31, 2027 as the hedged transactions affect earnings. At the inception of the 2027 interest rate swap, the Company determined that the swap qualified for cash flow hedge accounting under ASC 815. Therefore, changes in the fair value of the swap, net of taxes, will be recognized in other comprehensive income each period, then reclassified into the condensed consolidated statements of operations as a component of interest expense, financing costs and other, net in the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The 2027 interest rate swap is the only swap agreement outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 
 The effectiveness of the outstanding 2027 interest rate swap will be assessed qualitatively by the Company during the life of the hedge by (i) comparing the current terms of the hedge with the related hedged debt to assure they continue to coincide and (ii) through an evaluation of the ability of the counterparty to the hedge to honor its obligations under the hedge. The Company performed a qualitative analysis as of September 30, 2024 and concluded that the outstanding 2027 interest rate swap continues to meet the requirements under ASC 815 to qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the 2027 interest rate swap, net of tax, was million in favor of the Company. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reclassified gains of million and million out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and to interest expense, financing costs and other, net, respectively. Approximately million of net gains included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at September 30, 2024 is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months as interest payments are made on the Company s Term Loan and amortization of the inception date fair value of the 2027 interest rate swap occurs. The Company records any differences paid or received on its interest rate hedges to interest expense, financing costs and other, net within the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 The fair value of the interest rate swap is determined through the use of a pricing model, which utilizes verifiable inputs such as market interest rates that are observable at commonly quoted intervals (generally referred to as the forward curve for the full terms of the hedge agreements. These values reflect a Level 2 measurement under the applicable fair value hierarchy.

 Overview 
 We are the largest publicly traded distributor of roofing materials and complementary building products, such as siding and waterproofing, in North America. We have served the building industry for over 90 years and as of September 30, 2024, we operated 587 branches throughout all 50 states in the U.S. and seven provinces in Canada. We offer one of the most extensive ranges of high-quality professional grade exterior products comprising over 130,000 SKUs, and we serve nearly 100,000 residential and non-residential customers who trust us to help them save time, work more efficiently, and enhance their businesses. 
 We are strategically focused on two core markets, residential and non-residential roofing. We also distribute complementary building products like siding and waterproofing that are often utilized by the roofing and other specialty contractors we serve. As a distributor, our national scale, networked model, and specialized capabilities are competitive advantages, providing strong value for both customers and suppliers. We intend to grow faster than the market by enhancing our customers experience, activating a comprehensive go-to-market strategy, and expanding our footprint organically and through acquisitions while also driving margin-enhancing initiatives. 
 Our differentiated service model is designed to solve customer needs. The scale of our business provides branch coverage, technology enablement, and investment in our team that is the foundation of customer service excellence. In addition, service is further enhanced by our Beacon OTC Network, market-based sales teams, and national call center. We believe we also provide the most complete digital commerce platform in roofing distribution, creating value for customers who are able to operate their businesses more effectively and efficiently. 
 Our mission is to empower our customers to build more for their customers, businesses, and communities. Our project lifecycle support helps our customers find projects, land the job, do the work, and close projects out by providing guidance that allows our customers to deliver on project specifications and timelines that are critical to their success. Using an omni-channel approach and our Beacon PRO+ digital suite, we differentiate our services and drive customer retention. Our customer base is composed of professional contractors, home builders, building owners, lumberyards, and retailers across the U.S. and Canada who depend on reliable local access to exterior building products for residential and non-residential projects. Our customers vary in size, ranging from relatively small contractors to large contractors and builders that operate on a national scale. 
 24 

On February 24, 2022, we announced our Ambition 2025 Value Creation Framework Ambition 2025 to drive growth, enhance customer service, and expand our footprint in key markets, which included new Ambition 2025 financial targets and the Repurchase Program (as defined and further detailed below), as well as strategic deployment of capital on greenfields and acquisitions. 
 Specifically, since January 1, 2022 we have expanded our geographic footprint in key markets through the opening of 62 greenfield locations and acquisition of 83 total branches from 24 acquisitions through September 30, 2024. These greenfields and acquired branches contributed 412.7 million and 594.9 million to net sales in the first nine months of 2024, respectively, demonstrating our success in executing Ambition 2025. The scale we have achieved from our expansion serves as a competitive advantage, allowing us to use our assets more efficiently, and manage our expenses to drive long-term operating leverage. For additional information on our acquisition activity, see Note 3 in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The Ambition 2025 strategies are central to achieving sales growth, improving operational performance, and increasing profitability. Most importantly, our customers benefit from these initiatives as they are designed to make us more efficient and easier to do business with, differentiating our service from competitors. Our recent highlights in our pursuit of Ambition 2025 are further demonstrated by the following accomplishments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024: 
 17 greenfields opened; 
 40 branches acquired; 
 digital sales 25.5 higher than the prior year; and 
 continued improvements in the results of our branches falling in the bottom quintile of our financial performance metrics. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we operated 587 branches, which we designate as either standalone or co-located. A co-located branch shares all or a portion of a physical location with a standalone branch, but it records sales separately (to a different customer base and/or through different product offerings from the standalone branch) and generally operates with independent employees and inventory. 
 Preferred Stock Repurchase Agreement 
 On July 31, 2023 (the Repurchase Date ), we repurchased (the Repurchase all 400,000 issued and outstanding shares of Preferred Stock held by CD R Boulder Holdings, L.P. CD R Holdings, and the shares of Preferred Stock held by CD R Holdings, the Shares pursuant to a letter agreement dated July 6, 2023 in cash for 805.4 million, including 0.9 million of accrued but unpaid dividends as of such date (the Repurchase Price ). In connection with the Repurchase, CD R Holdings agreed that for as long as Philip Knisely or Nathan Sleeper remained a member of our Board and for a period of six months thereafter, the customary voting, standstill, and transfer restrictions set forth in the original Investment Agreement with respect to the Preferred Stock would continue to apply to CD R Holdings and its related fund in accordance with their terms. Following the closing of the Repurchase, Mr. Sleeper resigned from our Board and Mr. Knisely remained a member of our Board until his resignation on January 23, 2024. 
 The aggregate Repurchase Price and related transaction fees and expenses were financed by a combination of proceeds from the 2030 Senior Notes, which are further described in Note 11 in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the 2026 ABL (as defined in Note 11 in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements), and cash on hand. 
 On and after the Repurchase Date, all dividends and distributions ceased to accrue on the Shares, the repurchased Shares are no longer deemed outstanding, and all rights of CD R Holdings with respect to the repurchased Shares terminated. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred costs directly attributable to the Repurchase of 9.3 million. 
 The difference between the total consideration paid for the Repurchase, inclusive of direct costs, and the carrying value of the Preferred Stock, resulted in a 414.6 million Repurchase premium (the Repurchase Premium which was recorded as a reduction to retained earnings within the condensed consolidated statement of stockholders equity. In calculating basic and diluted net income (loss) per common share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Repurchase Premium is included as a component of net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders. 
 Classification of Branch Results 
 In managing our business, we consider all growth, including the opening of new branches (also referred to as greenfields), to be organic growth, unless it results from an acquisition. When we refer to organic growth, we include growth from existing branches and greenfields but exclude growth from acquired branches until they have been reclassified to existing as described further below. 
 During the fourth quarter of 2023, we revised our definition of when a branch classification changes from acquired to existing. Previously, the results of operations of branches were designated as acquired until they had been under our ownership for at least four full fiscal quarters at the start of the fiscal reporting period, after which such branches were classified as existing. Under our new definition, the results of operations of branches will be designated as acquired until they have been under our ownership and have contributed to our results of operations for at least 12 calendar months (treating partial months as full months), after which such 
 25 

branches are classified as existing. The effect of this change in definition is that the prior year results of operations for branches will be reclassified to existing when the comparable current month s financial results are also classified as existing. As a result of this change, a branch s results of operations can also now be classified as both acquired and existing in the same fiscal reporting period. We believe this change enhances comparability of branch results between periods and better demonstrates the economic impact of newly acquired branches on our financial results. 
 The following table illustrates the classification of financial results for branches acquired during the nine months ended September 30, 2023: 
 Date Acquired Company Name Branches Acquired Results of Operations Classified as Acquired Results of Operations Classified as Existing September 5, 2023 S H Building Material Corporation 1 January 2024 - August 2024

 January 2024 - September 2024 
 
 All branches acquired prior to January 1, 2023 are classified as existing and all branches acquired after September 30, 2023 are classified as acquired. 
 We also apply the same definition for determining when a branch classification changes from greenfield to existing (e.g., branches are designated as greenfields until they have been opened for at least 12 calendar months (treating partial months as full months), after which such branches are classified as existing). It should also be noted that greenfield branches incur limited operating costs prior to their open date for things such as lease costs and other costs incurred in getting the branch ready to open. All such costs incurred prior to the greenfield open date are also classified as greenfield in all periods when discussing our results of operations. 
 
 Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 The following tables set forth condensed consolidated statements of operations data and such data as a percentage of total net sales for the periods presented (in millions): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net sales 2,772.6 2,584.3 Cost of products sold 2,042.2 1,911.7 Gross profit 730.4 672.6 Operating expense: Selling, general and administrative 430.2 374.3 Depreciation 28.8 23.1 Amortization 24.7 21.4 Total operating expense 483.7 418.8 Income (loss) from operations 246.7 253.8 Interest expense, financing costs and other, net 48.7 35.2 Income (loss) before provision for income taxes 198.0 218.6 Provision for (benefit from) income taxes 52.7 57.3 Net income (loss) 145.3 161.3

 Net Sales 
 Net sales increased 7.3 to 2.77 billion in 2024, up from 2.58 billion in 2023. The following table summarizes net sales by line of business for the periods presented (in millions): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Year-over-Year Change 2024 2023 Net Sales Mix Net Sales Mix Residential roofing products 1,404.9 50.7 1,372.8 53.1 32.1 2.3 Non-residential roofing products 739.0 26.7 675.2 26.1 63.8 9.4 Complementary building products 628.7 22.6 536.3 20.8 92.4 17.2 Total net sales 2,772.6 100.0 2,584.3 100.0 188.3 7.3 
 The following table summarizes net sales by branch classification for the periods presented (in millions): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 
 Change 2024 2023 Organic net sales Existing 2,581.3 2,584.3 (3.0) (0.1) Greenfields 48.0 48.0 n/m Total organic net sales 2,629.3 2,584.3 45.0 1.7 Acquired 143.3 143.3 n/m Total net sales 2,772.6 2,584.3 188.3 7.3 
 The increase in organic net sales was primarily driven by an increase in weighted-average selling price of approximately 1-2 coupled with an increase in estimated organic volume of approximately 0-1 . Total net sales continued to benefit from greenfields and acquired branches. 
 We estimate the impact of inflation or deflation on our sales and gross profit by looking at changes in our average selling prices and gross margins (discussed below). To calculate approximate weighted average selling price and product cost changes, we review organic U.S. warehouse sales of the same items sold regionally period over period and normalize the data for non-representative outliers. To determine estimated volumes, we subtract the change in weighted average selling price, calculated as described above, from the total changes in net sales, excluding acquisitions and dispositions. As a result, and especially in high inflationary periods, the weighted average selling price and estimated volume changes may not be directly comparable to changes reported in prior periods.

Gross Profit 
 The following table summarizes gross profit and gross margin by branch classification for the periods presented (in millions): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Change 1 
 2024 2023 Organic gross profit Existing 682.4 672.6 9.8 1.5 Greenfields 12.7 12.7 n/m Total organic gross profit 695.1 672.6 22.5 3.3 Acquired 35.3 35.3 n/m Total gross profit 730.4 672.6 57.8 8.6 Gross margin 26.3 26.0 N/A 0.3 
 
 1. Percentage changes for dollar amounts represent the ratable increase or decrease from period-to-period. Percentage changes for percentages represent the net period-to-period change in basis points. 
 Gross margin was 26.3 in 2024, up 0.3 percentage points from 26.0 in 2023. The year-over-year increase in gross margin resulted from a weighted-average selling price increase (calculated as described above) of approximately 1-2 , partially offset by a weighted-average product cost increase of approximately 0-1 . 
 Selling, General, and Administrative SG A Expense 
 The following table summarizes SG A expense by branch classification for the periods presented (in millions): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Organic SG A Existing 397.5 373.9 23.6 6.3 Greenfields 8.9 0.4 8.5 n/m Total organic SG A 406.4 374.3 32.1 8.6 Acquired 23.8 23.8 n/m Total SG A 430.2 374.3 55.9 14.9 Total SG A as of net sales 15.5 14.5 
 SG A expense increased 14.9 , or 55.9 million, to 430.2 million in 2024, up from 374.3 million in 2023. At the end of the third quarter, in response to market conditions, we reduced headcount. 
 The increase in organic SG A expense was mainly influenced by the following factors: 
 a 24.9 million increase in payroll and employee benefit costs, primarily due to a higher average number of employees in 2024, as well as one-time severance and employee benefit costs for employees impacted by our operating cost reduction initiative; and 
 a 6.4 million increase in warehouse operating costs, primarily due to higher rent expense. 
 Total SG A expense as a percentage of net sales was higher in 2024 when compared to 2023 primarily as a result of the above factors. The impact of recent greenfields that have not yet fully matured and acquired branches that are not yet fully synergized also negatively affected our operating leverage. 
 28 

Depreciation Expense 
 Depreciation expense was 28.8 million in 2024, compared to 23.1 million in 2023. The comparative increase was primarily due to an increase in property and equipment as a result of new and acquired branches. 
 Amortization Expense 
 Amortization expense was 24.7 million in 2024, compared to 21.4 million in 2023. The comparative increase was primarily due to amortization expense associated with new intangible assets as a result of recent acquisitions. 
 Interest Expense, Financing Costs and Other 
 Interest expense, financing costs and other, net was 48.7 million in 2024, compared to 35.2 million in 2023. The comparative increase was primarily due to higher average debt balances during 2024 as a result of the refinancing of our 2028 Term Loan in March 2024 and an increase in our 2026 U.S. Revolver to build inventory, support our acquisition activity during 2024, and repurchase stock through our May 2024 ASR Agreement (as defined and further detailed below). 
 Income Taxes 
 Income tax provision (benefit) was 52.7 million in 2024, compared to 57.3 million in 2023. The comparative decrease in income tax provision was primarily due to lower pre-tax income. The effective tax rate, excluding any discrete items, was 26.6 in 2024, compared to 27.0 in 2023. We expect our 2024 effective tax rate, excluding any discrete items that may arise during the tax year, will range from approximately 26.0 to 27.0 . 
 Net Income (Loss)/Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share 
 We calculate basic net income (loss) per common share by dividing net income (loss), less dividends on Preferred Stock and adjustments for participating securities for periods in which they are outstanding, by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is calculated based upon the weighted-average common shares plus the effect of all potentially dilutive common share equivalents, except when the effect would be anti-dilutive. For periods in which Preferred Stock is outstanding, diluted net income (loss) per common share is calculated by utilizing the most dilutive result after applying and comparing the two-class method and if-converted method. 
 The following table presents all the components utilized to calculate basic and diluted net income (loss) per common share (in millions, except per share amounts; certain amounts may not recalculate due to rounding): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Numerator: Net income (loss) 145.3 161.3 Dividends on Preferred Stock (1.9) Undistributed income allocated to participating securities (7.6) Repurchase Premium (414.6) Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders Basic and Diluted 145.3 (262.8) Denominator: Weighted-average common shares outstanding Basic 62.0 63.2 Effect of common share equivalents 1.1 Weighted-average common shares outstanding Diluted 63.1 63.2 Net income (loss) per common share: Basic 2.34 (4.16) Diluted 2.30 (4.16)

Net Sales 
 Net sales increased 7.9 to 7.36 billion in 2024, up from 6.82 billion in 2023. The following table summarizes net sales by line of business for the periods presented (in millions): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Year-over-Year Change 2024 2023 Net Sales Net Sales Residential roofing products 3,661.2 49.7 3,521.5 51.6 139.7 4.0 Non-residential roofing products 2,012.7 27.4 1,796.2 26.4 216.5 12.1 Complementary building products 1,685.7 22.9 1,502.6 22.0 183.1 12.2 Total net sales 7,359.6 100.0 6,820.3 100.0 539.3 7.9 
 The following table summarizes net sales by branch classification for the periods presented (in millions):

 The increase in organic net sales was primarily driven by an increase in estimated organic volume of approximately 2-3 , as well as an increase in weighted-average selling price of approximately 1-2 . Total net sales continued to benefit from greenfields and acquired branches. 
 We estimate the impact of inflation or deflation on our sales and gross profit by looking at changes in our average selling prices and gross margins (discussed below). To calculate approximate weighted average selling price and product cost changes, we review organic U.S. warehouse sales of the same items sold regionally period over period and normalize the data for non-representative outliers. To determine estimated volumes, we subtract the change in weighted average selling price, calculated as described above, from the total changes in net sales, excluding acquisitions and dispositions. As a result, and especially in high inflationary periods, the weighted average selling price and estimated volume changes may not be directly comparable to changes reported in prior periods. 
 Gross Profit 
 The following table summarizes gross profit and gross margin by branch classification for the periods presented (in millions): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 1 
 2024 2023 Organic gross profit Existing 1,779.5 1,750.7 28.8 1.6 Greenfields 34.9 34.9 n/m Total organic gross profit 1,814.4 1,750.7 63.7 3.6 Acquired 72.9 72.9 n/m Total gross profit 1,887.3 1,750.7 136.6 7.8 Gross margin 25.6 25.7 N/A (0.1) 
 
 1. Percentage changes for dollar amounts represent the ratable increase or decrease from period-to-period. Percentage changes for percentages represent the net period-to-period change in basis points. 
 Gross margin was 25.6 in 2024, down 0.1 percentage point from 25.7 in 2023. The modest year-over-year decrease in gross margin resulted from a weighted-average product cost increase of approximately 1-2 coupled with a higher non-residential product mix, partially offset by a weighted-average selling price increase (calculated as described above) of approximately 1-2 .

Selling, General, and Administrative Expense 
 The following table summarizes SG A expense by branch classification for the periods presented (in millions): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Organic SG A Existing 1,149.6 1,070.4 79.2 7.4 Greenfields 27.5 0.9 26.6 n/m Total organic SG A 1,177.1 1,071.3 105.8 9.9 Acquired 53.1 53.1 n/m Total SG A 1,230.2 1,071.3 158.9 14.8 Total SG A as of net sales 16.7 15.7 
 SG A expense increased 14.8 , or 158.9 million, to 1.23 billion in 2024, up from 1.07 billion in 2023. At the end of the third quarter, in response to market conditions, we reduced headcount. 
 The increase in organic SG A expense was mainly influenced by the following factors: 
 a 68.1 million increase in payroll and employee benefit costs, primarily due to higher average headcount in 2024 and, to a lesser extent, one-time severance and employee benefit costs for employees impacted by our operating cost reduction initiative; 
 a 16.3 million increase in warehouse operating costs, primarily due to higher rent expense; and 
 a 11.5 million increase in general and administrative expenses, primarily due to higher professional fees. 
 Total SG A expense as a percentage of net sales was higher in 2024 when compared to 2023 primarily as a result of the above factors. The impact of recent greenfields that have not yet fully matured and acquired branches that are not yet fully synergized also negatively affected our operating leverage. 
 Depreciation Expense 
 Depreciation expense was 80.8 million in 2024, compared to 65.6 million in 2023. The comparative increase was primarily due to an increase in property and equipment as a result of new and acquired branches. 
 Amortization Expense 
 Amortization expense was 68.7 million in 2024, compared to 65.1 million in 2023. The comparative increase was primarily due to amortization expense associated with new intangible assets as a result of recent acquisitions. 
 Interest Expense, Financing Costs and Other 
 Interest expense, financing costs and other, net was 132.7 million in 2024, compared to 89.0 million in 2023. The comparative increase was primarily due to higher average debt balances in 2024 as a result of the 2030 Senior Notes issued in July 2023, the refinancing of our 2028 Term Loan in March 2024, and an increase in our 2026 U.S. Revolver to build inventory, support our acquisition activity during 2024, and repurchase stock through our May 2024 ASR Agreement (as defined and detailed further below). 
 Loss on Debt Extinguishment 
 Loss on debt extinguishment was 2.4 million in 2024 due to the refinancing of our 2028 Term Loan and includes the write-off of previously capitalized debt issuance costs as well as certain third-party professional fees. 
 Income Taxes 
 Income tax provision (benefit) was 94.4 million in 2024, compared to 119.8 million in 2023. The comparative decrease in income tax provision was primarily due to lower pre-tax income coupled with an increase in the excess tax benefits of stock-based compensation during 2024. The effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, was 26.6 in 2024, compared to 26.7 in 2023. We expect our 2024 effective tax rate, excluding any discrete items that may arise during the tax year, will range from approximately 26.0 to 27.0 .

Net Income (Loss)/Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share 
 We calculate basic net income (loss) per common share by dividing net income (loss), less dividends on Preferred Stock and adjustments for participating securities for periods in which they are outstanding, by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is calculated based upon the weighted-average common shares plus the effect of all potentially dilutive common share equivalents, except when the effect would be anti-dilutive. For periods in which Preferred Stock is outstanding, diluted net income (loss) per common share is calculated by utilizing the most dilutive result after applying and comparing the two-class method and if-converted method.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we prepare certain financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ), specifically: 
 Adjusted Operating Expense . We define Adjusted Operating Expense as operating expense, excluding the impact of the adjusting items (as described below). 
 Adjusted Net Income (Loss) . We define Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as net income (loss), excluding the impact of the adjusting items (as described below). 
 Adjusted EBITDA . We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), excluding the impact of interest expense (net of interest income), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and the adjusting items (as described below). 
 We use these supplemental non-GAAP measures to evaluate financial performance, analyze the underlying trends in our business and establish operational goals and forecasts that are used when allocating resources. We expect to compute our non-GAAP financial measures consistently using the same methods each period. 
 We believe these non-GAAP measures are useful measures because they permit investors to better understand changes over comparative periods by providing financial results that are unaffected by certain items that are not indicative of ongoing operating performance. 
 While we believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors when evaluating our business, they are not prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, and therefore should be considered supplemental in nature. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures may have material limitations including, but not limited to, the exclusion of certain costs without a corresponding reduction of net income for the income generated by the assets to which the excluded costs relate. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies. 
 33 

Adjusting Items to Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 The impact of the following expense (income) items is excluded from each of our non-GAAP measures (the adjusting items ): 
 Acquisition costs . Represent certain direct and incremental costs related to acquisitions, including: amortization of intangible assets; professional fees, branch integration expenses, travel expenses, employee severance and retention costs, and other personnel expenses classified as selling, general and administrative; gains/losses related to changes in fair value of contingent consideration or holdback liabilities; and amortization of debt issuance costs. Acquisition costs are impacted by the timing and size of the acquisitions. We exclude acquisition costs from our non-GAAP financial measures to provide a useful comparison of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies because such amounts vary significantly based on the magnitude of the acquisition and do not reflect our core operations. 
 Restructuring costs . Represent costs stemming from headcount rationalization efforts and certain rebranding costs; impact of divestitures; amortization of debt issuance costs; debt refinancing and extinguishment costs; and abandoned lease costs. We exclude restructuring costs from our non-GAAP financial measures, as such items vary significantly based on the magnitude of the restructuring activity and also do not reflect expected future operating expenses. Additionally, these costs do not necessarily provide meaningful insight into the current or past core operations of our business. 
 The following table presents the pre-tax impact of the adjusting items on our condensed consolidated statements of operations for each of the periods indicated (in millions): 
 Operating Expense Non-Operating Expense SG A Amortization Interest Expense Other (Income) Expense Total Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Acquisition costs 4.0 24.7 1.0 29.7 Restructuring costs 12.1 0.5 12.6 Total adjusting items 16.1 24.7 1.5 42.3 Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Acquisition costs 2.2 21.4 1.0 24.6 Restructuring costs 0.5 0.5 Total adjusting items 2.2 21.4 1.5 25.1 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Acquisition costs 10.8 68.7 2.9 82.4 Restructuring costs 1

 Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations 
 The demand for exterior building materials is closely correlated to both seasonal changes and unpredictable weather patterns, therefore demand fluctuations are expected. 
 In general, our net sales and net income are highest in quarters ending June 30, September 30, and December 31, which represent the peak months of construction and re-roofing. Conversely, we have historically experienced low net income levels or net losses in quarters ending March 31, when winter construction cycles and cold weather patterns have an adverse impact on our customers ability to conduct their business. 
 Our balance sheet fluctuates throughout the year, driven by similar seasonal trends. We generally experience an increase in inventory and peak cash usage in the quarters ending March 31 and June 30, driven primarily by increased purchasing that is necessary to meet the rise in demand for our products during the warmer months. Accounts receivable, accounts payable, and cash collections are generally at their highest during the quarters ending June 30 and September 30, when sales are typically at their peak. 
 At times, we experience fluctuations in our financial performance that are driven by factors outside of our control, including the impact that severe weather events and unusual weather patterns may have on the timing and magnitude of demand and material availability. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity is defined as the current amount of readily available cash and the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet the current needs for cash. We assess our liquidity in terms of our cash and cash equivalents on hand and the ability to generate cash to fund our operating activities, taking into consideration available borrowings and the seasonal nature of our business. 
 Our principal sources of liquidity as of September 30, 2024 were our cash and cash equivalents of 68.0 million and our available borrowings of approximately 833.0 million under our asset-based revolving lines of credit. 
 Significant factors which could affect future liquidity include the following: 
 the adequacy of available bank lines of credit; 
 the ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms; 
 cash flows generated from operating activities; 
 36 

working capital management; 
 acquisitions; 
 share repurchases; and 
 capital expenditures. 
 Our primary capital needs are for working capital obligations and other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, capital expenditures, and share repurchases. Our primary sources of working capital are cash from operations and bank borrowings. We have financed larger acquisitions through increased bank borrowings and the issuance of long-term debt and common or preferred stock. We then repay any such borrowings with cash flows from operations or subsequent financings. We have funded most of our capital expenditures with cash on hand, increased bank borrowings, or equipment financing, and then reduced those obligations with cash flows from operations. We may explore additional or replacement financing sources in order to bolster liquidity and strengthen our capital structure. 
 We believe we currently have adequate liquidity and availability of capital to fund our present operations, meet our commitments on our existing debt and fund anticipated growth, including expansion in existing and targeted market areas. We may seek additional acquisition opportunities from time to time, including as part of our Ambition 2025 initiative. If suitable acquisition opportunities or working capital needs arise that require additional financing, we believe that our financial position, credit profile, and earnings history provide a sufficient base for obtaining additional financing resources at reasonable rates and terms. We may also choose to issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock in order to raise funds. 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in millions): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 59.6 525.7 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (482.2) (144.9) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 407.7 (378.8) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (1.1) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (16.0) 2.0 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 59.6 million in 2024, compared to 525.7 million in 2023. Cash from operations decreased 466.1 million in 2024 primarily due to an incremental cash outflow of 438.1 million stemming from changes to our net working capital, mainly driven by unfavorable changes in cash flows related to inventories of 237.8 million, accounts payable and accrued expenses of 202.9 million. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 482.2 million in 2024, compared to 144.9 million in 2023. Cash used in investing activities increased 337.3 million in 2024 primarily due to an increase in acquisitions during the period. See Note 3 in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 407.7 million in 2024, compared to net cash used in financing activities of 378.8 million in 2023. Cash provided by financing activities increased 786.5 million in 2024 primarily due to the one-time repurchase of convertible preferred stock in 2023, partially offset by an increase in common stock repurchases compared to the prior year. 
 Financing Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had access to the following financing arrangements: 
 the 2026 U.S. Revolver, an asset-based revolving line of credit in the U.S., in an amount up to 1.25 billion and with an outstanding balance (net of unamortized debt issuance costs) of 426.8 million; 
 the 2026 Canada Revolver, an asset-based revolving line of credit in Canada, in an amount up to 50.0 million and with an outstanding balance of 11.1 million; 
 the 2028 Term Loan with an outstanding balance (net of unamortized debt issuance costs) of 1.26 billion; and 
 37 

three separate senior notes instruments, the 2030 Senior Notes, 2029 Senior Notes, and 2026 Senior Notes, with outstanding balances (net of unamortized debt issuance costs) of 593.1 million, 347.7 million, and 298.6 million, respectively. 
 See Note 11 in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our current financing arrangements. 
 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 On February 24, 2022, we announced a new share repurchase program (the Repurchase Program ), pursuant to which we may purchase up to 500.0 million of our common stock. On February 23, 2023, we announced that our Board authorized and approved an increase of the Repurchase Program by approximately 387.9 million, permitting future share repurchases of 500.0 million after considering actual share repurchases as of such re-authorization date. 
 Share repurchases under the Repurchase Program may be made from time to time through various means, including open market purchases (including block trades), privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase ASR transactions or through a series of forward purchase agreements, option contracts or similar agreements and contracts (including Rule 10b5-1 plans) adopted by us, in each case in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC, including, if applicable, Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The timing, volume, and nature of share repurchases pursuant to the Repurchase Program are at our management s discretion and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Shares repurchased under the Repurchase Program are retired immediately and are included in the category of authorized but unissued shares. Direct and incremental costs associated with the Repurchase Program are deferred and included as a component of the purchase price. The excess of the purchase price over the par value of the common shares is reflected in retained earnings. 
 On May 9, 2024, pursuant to the Repurchase Program, we entered into a Supplemental Confirmation (together with our March 22, 2022 Variable Tenor ASR Master Agreement, the May 2024 ASR Agreement with Citibank, N.A. Citi to repurchase 225.0 million (the ASR Repurchase Price of our common stock. Under the terms of the May 2024 ASR Agreement, we paid the ASR Repurchase Price to Citi and received an initial share delivery of 1,927,608 shares of our common stock from Citi, representing 80 of the total expected share repurchases under the May 2024 ASR Agreement, based on the closing price of our common stock of 93.38 on May 9, 2024. The final number of shares to be repurchased pursuant to the May 2024 ASR Agreement will be determined upon settlement based on the daily volume-weighted average price of our common stock during the term of the May 2024 ASR Agreement, less a discount and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms of the May 2024 ASR Agreement. At settlement, Citi will deliver additional shares of our common stock to us, or, under certain circumstances, we will deliver cash or shares of our common stock to Citi, with the method of settlement at our election. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining 45.0 million of the ASR Repurchase Price was evaluated as an unsettled equity forward contract indexed to our common stock and classified within stockholders equity as a reduction to additional paid in capital until the equity forward contract settles. The final settlement of the May 2024 ASR Agreement is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 The following table sets forth our share repurchases (in millions, except per share data): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Total number of shares repurchased 
 0.3 1.9 1.5 Amount repurchased 1 
 25.1 180.0 99.9 Average price per share 83.89 93.38 67.90 
 
 1. Amount repurchased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 excludes the 45.0 million equity forward contract. 
 We did not make any share repurchases during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Share repurchases for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were made pursuant to the May 2024 ASR Agreement. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred costs directly attributable to the Repurchase Program of approximately 0.9 million and 1.0 million, respectively. 
 Share repurchases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were made on the open market through a Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred costs directly attributable to the Repurchase Program of approximately 0.2 million and 0.8 million, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 164.1 million available for repurchases remaining under the Repurchase Program. See Note 7 in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024, management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act).

We maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting that is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. 
 There have been no material changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

If any Lender shall not remit the full amount that it is required to make available to Administrative Agent in immediately available funds as and when required hereby and if Administrative Agent has made available to Borrowers such amount, then that Lender shall be obligated to immediately remit such amount to Administrative Agent, together with interest as provided in Section 6.7. A notice submitted by Administrative Agent to any Lender with respect to amounts owing under this Section 2.3(c)(ii) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. If the amount that a Lender is required to remit is made available to Administrative Agent, then such payment to Administrative Agent shall constitute such Lender s Revolving Loan for all purposes of this Agreement. If such amount is not made available to Administrative Agent on the Business Day following the Funding Date, Administrative Agent will notify Borrowers of such failure to fund and, upon demand by Administrative Agent, Borrowers shall pay such amount to Administrative Agent as provided in Section 6.7. (d) Protective Advances and Optional Overadvances. (i) Any contrary provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document notwithstanding, at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the failure of any other condition precedent or termination of the Commitments, Administrative Agent is hereby authorized by Borrowers and the Lenders, from time to time, in Administrative Agent s Permitted Discretion, to make Revolving Loans (or at its option, Swingline Loans on behalf of Swingline Lender) to, or for the benefit of, Borrowers, on behalf of the Lenders, that Administrative Agent, in its Permitted Discretion, deems necessary or desirable (A) to preserve or protect the Collateral, or any portion thereof, or (B) to enhance the likelihood of repayment of the Obligations other than the Bank Product Obligations (the Revolving Loans described in this Section 2.3(d)(i) to or for the benefit of a US Borrower being referred to as US Protective Advances , and to or for the benefit of a Canadian Borrower being referred to as Canadian Protective Advances , and US Protective Advances and Canadian Protective Advances being collectively referred to as Protective Advances ). The authority of Administrative Agent to make Protective Advances may at any time be revoked by the 74 7951095.17951095.8 Required Lenders provided, that, such revocation must be in writing and will only be effective prospectively upon Administrative Agent s receipt thereof. (ii) Any contrary provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document notwithstanding, but subject to Sections 2.3(d)(iii) and (v), the Lenders hereby authorize Administrative Agent or Swingline Lender, as applicable, and either Administrative Agent or Swingline Lender, as applicable, may, but is not obligated to, knowingly and intentionally, continue to: (A) make US Revolving Loans (including US Swingline Loans) to US Borrowers notwithstanding that a US Overadvance exists or would occur as a result thereof, so long as after giving effect to such US Revolving Loans, (1) the US Outstandings do not exceed the US Borrowing Base by more than ten percent (10 ), and (2) the US Outstandings do not exceed the US Loan Limit; and (B) make Canadian Revolving Loans (including Canadian Swingline Loans) to Canadian Borrowers notwithstanding that a Canadian Overadvance exists or would occur as a result thereof, so long as after giving effect to such Canadian Revolving Loans, (1) the Canadian Outstandings do not exceed the Canadian Borrowing Base by more than ten percent (10 ), and (2) the Canadian Outstandings do not exceed the Canadian Loan Limit. (iii) In the event that Administrative Agent obtains actual knowledge that an Overadvance exists, regardless of the amount of, or reason for, such Overadvance, Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders as soon as practicable, and no Overadvances shall knowingly be made following the date that is thirty (30) Business Days thereafter if Administrative Agent receives a written direction from Required Lenders that Overadvances should not be made following such thirty (30) day period. The foregoing provisions are meant for the benefit of the Lenders and Administrative Agent and are not meant for the benefit of Borrowers, which shall continue to be bound by the provisions of Section 2.2. Each Lender with a Commitment shall be obligated to settle with Administrative Agent as provided in Section 2.3 for the amount of such Lender s Commitment Percentage of any unintentional Overadvances by Administrative Agent reported to such Lender, any intentional Overadvances made as permitted under Section 2.3, and any Overadvances resulting from the charging to the Loan Account of interest, fees or other expenses payable under the Loan Documents. (iv) Each Protective Advance and each Overadvance (each, a Special Advance shall be deemed to be a Revolving Loan hereunder, and may be made in any Available Currency, as determined by Administrative Agent. Prior to Settlement therefor, all payments on the Special Advances shall be payable to Administrative Agent solely for its own account. The Special Advances shall be repayable on demand, be secured by Administrative Agent s Liens, constitute Obligations hereunder, and bear interest at the rate applicable from time to time to Swingline Loans made in the applicable currency. The ability of Administrative Agent to make Protective Advances is separate and distinct from its ability to make Overadvances and its ability to make Overadvances is separate and distinct from its ability to make Protective Advances. The limitations on Administrative Agent s ability to make Protective Advances do not apply to Overadvances and the limitations on Administrative Agent s ability to make Overadvances do not apply to Protective Advances.

(e) Use of Affiliates. Each Lender may, at its option, make any Revolving Loan available to any Borrower that is not a US Borrower by causing any foreign or domestic branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; provided, that, any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of such Borrower to repay such Revolving Loan or other Obligations in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

Each such decrease in the US Loan Limit shall be allocated between each US Lender based on its US Commitment Percentage and corresponding increase in the Canadian Loan Limit shall be allocated between each Canadian Lender based on its Canadian Commitment Percentage. (c) Any decrease in the Canadian Loan Limit and corresponding increase in the US Loan Limit pursuant to Section 2.4(a)(ii) above shall be subject to the following conditions: (i) the Borrower Representative shall have provided to Administrative Agent a written notice at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the requested effective date therefor setting forth the proposed amount of such decrease, (ii) after giving effect to any such decrease, the amount of the Canadian Outstandings shall not be more than the amount equal to ninety percent (90 of the Canadian Loan Limit as so decreased, (iii) no more than one (1) such decrease may be requested in any twelve (12) consecutive month period, and (iv) as of the date of any such decrease in the Canadian Loan Limit (and corresponding increase in the US Loan Limit), no Event of Default shall exist or have occurred and be continuing. Each such decrease in the Canadian Loan Limit shall be allocated between each Canadian Lender based on its Canadian Commitment Percentage and corresponding increase in the US Loan Limit shall be allocated to the US Commitment of each US Lender that is also a Canadian Lender in the amount of the decrease in such Lender s Canadian Commitment.

SECTION 2.5 Settlement. (a) It is agreed that each Lender s funded portion of the Revolving Loans is intended by the Lenders to equal, at all times, such Lender s Commitment Percentage of the outstanding Revolving Loans. Such agreement notwithstanding, Administrative Agent, Swingline Lender, and the other Lenders agree (which agreement shall not be for the benefit of Borrowers) that in order to facilitate the administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, settlement among the Lenders as to the Revolving Loans, the Swingline Loans, and the Special Advances shall take place on a periodic basis in accordance with the following provisions: (b) Administrative Agent shall request settlement Settlement with the Lenders no less frequently than weekly, or on a more frequent basis if so determined by Administrative Agent in its sole discretion (A) on behalf of Swingline Lender, with respect to the outstanding Swingline Loans, (B) for itself, with respect to the outstanding Special Advances, and (C) with respect to any Credit Party s or any of its Subsidiaries payments or other amounts received, as to each by notifying the Lenders by telecopy, telephone, or other similar form of transmission, of such requested Settlement, no later than 2:00 p.m. on the Business Day immediately prior to the date of such requested Settlement or, in the case of the Settlement of any Canadian BA RateCORRA Loan or SOFR Loan no later than 2:00 p.m. on the third (3rd) Business Day immediately prior to the date of such requested Settlement (the date of such requested Settlement being the Settlement Date ).

Any reduction of the Commitments shall be applied to the Commitment of each Lender according to its applicable Commitment Percentage. All Unused Line Fees accrued until the effective date of any termination of the Commitment shall be paid on the effective date of such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any notice of voluntary reduction delivered in connection with any refinancing of the Credit Facility with the proceeds of such refinancing or of any incurrence of Indebtedness, may be, if expressly so stated to be, contingent upon the consummation of such refinancing or incurrence and may be revoked by Borrower Representative in the event such refinancing is not consummated (provided, that, the failure of such contingency shall not relieve any Borrower from its obligations in respect thereof under Section 6.9). Once reduced, the Commitments may not be increased other than pursuant to Section 6.13. Each such reduction of the US Commitments shall reduce the US Commitments of each Lender proportionately in accordance with its ratable share thereof and each such reduction of the Canadian Commitments shall reduce the Canadian Commitments of each proportionately in accordance with its ratable share thereof. (b) Corresponding Payment. Each permanent reduction permitted pursuant to this Section 4.2 shall be accompanied by a payment of principal sufficient to reduce the aggregate outstanding Revolving Loans, Swingline Loans and LC Obligations, as applicable, after such reduction to the Commitments as so reduced, and if the aggregate amount of all outstanding US Letters of Credit exceeds the US Commitments as so reduced or outstanding Canadian Letters of Credit exceeds the Canadian Commitments as so reduced, the applicable Borrowers shall be required to deposit Cash Collateral in a Cash Collateral account opened by Administrative Agent in an amount equal to such excess. Such Cash 84 7951095.17951095.8 Collateral shall be applied in accordance with Section 11.2(b). Any reduction of the Commitment to zero shall be accompanied by payment of all outstanding Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans (and furnishing of Cash Collateral satisfactory to Administrative Agent for all LC Obligations) and shall result in the termination of the Commitments and the Swingline Commitment and the Credit Facility. If the reduction of the Commitment requires the repayment of any SOFR Loan, such repayment shall be accompanied by any amount required to be paid pursuant to Section 6.9. SECTION 4.3 Manner of Payment. (a) Each payment by any Borrower on account of the principal of or interest on the Revolving Loans or of any fee, commission or other amounts (including the LC Obligations) payable to the Lenders under this Agreement shall be made not later than 1:00 p.m. on the date specified for payment under this Agreement to Administrative Agent to the Administrative Agent Payment Account for the account of the Lenders entitled to such payment in the applicable currency, in immediately available funds and shall be made without any set off, counterclaim or deduction whatsoever. Any payment received after such time but before 2:00 p.m. on such day shall be deemed a payment on such date for the purposes of Section 11.1, but for all other purposes shall be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding Business Day. Any payment received after 2:00 p.m. shall be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding Business Day for all purposes and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue until such following Business Day. (b) Any payments in respect of the Obligations shall be applied to Obligations denominated in the same currency as the payments received and, at Administrative Agent s option, thereafter to such Obligations denominated in the other currencies, if any; provided, that, Administrative Agent may, at its option (but is not obligated to), convert such currency received to the currency in which Obligations are denominated at the Exchange Rate calculated by Administrative Agent in good faith on such date, and Borrowers shall pay the costs of such conversion (or Administrative Agent may, at its option, charge such costs to the Loan Account of any Borrower maintained by Administrative Agent).

(d) Unless Administrative Agent receives notice from Borrower Representative prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders that Borrowers will not make such payment in full as and when required, Administrative Agent may assume that Borrowers have made (or will make) such payment in full to Administrative Agent on such date in immediately available funds and Administrative Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent Borrowers do 85 7951095.17951095.8 

not make such payment in full to Administrative Agent on the date when due, each Lender severally shall repay to Administrative Agent on demand such amount in accordance with Section 6.7(a).

(g) The provisions of this Section 4.10 are made for the benefit of Administrative Agent, each member of the Lender Group, each Bank Product Provider, and their respective successors and assigns, and may be enforced by it or them from time to time against any or all Borrowers as often as occasion therefor may arise and without requirement on the part of Administrative Agent, any member of the Lender Group, any Bank Product Provider, or any of their successors or assigns first to marshal any of its or their claims or to exercise any of its or their rights against any Borrower or to exhaust any remedies available to it or them against any Borrower or to resort to any other source or means of obtaining payment of any of the Obligations hereunder or to elect any other remedy. The provisions of this Section 4.10 shall remain in effect until all of the Obligations shall have been paid in full or otherwise fully satisfied. If at any time, any payment, or any part thereof, made in respect of any of the Obligations, is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower, or otherwise, the provisions of this Section 4.10 will forthwith be reinstated in effect, as though such payment had not been made. (h) Each Borrower hereby agrees that it will not enforce any of its rights of contribution or subrogation against any other Borrower with respect to any liability incurred by it hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, any payments made by it to Administrative Agent or Lenders with respect to any of the Obligations or any collateral security therefor until such time as all of the Obligations have 92 7951095.17951095.8 been paid in full in cash. Any claim which any Borrower may have against any other Borrower with respect to any payments to any Administrative Agent or any member of the Lender Group hereunder or under any of the Bank Product Agreements are hereby expressly made subordinate and junior in right of payment, without limitation as to any increases in the Obligations arising hereunder or thereunder, to the prior payment in full in cash of the Obligations and, in the event of any Insolvency Proceeding relating to any Borrower, its debts or its assets, whether voluntary or involuntary, all such Obligations shall be paid in full in cash before any payment or distribution of any character, whether in cash, securities or other property, shall be made to any other Borrower therefor. (i) Each Borrower hereby agrees that after the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, such Borrower will not demand, sue for or otherwise attempt to collect any indebtedness of any other Borrower owing to such Borrower until the Obligations shall have been paid in full in cash. If, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, such Borrower shall collect, enforce or receive any amounts in respect of such indebtedness, such amounts shall be collected, enforced and received by such Borrower as trustee for Administrative Agent, and such Borrower shall deliver any such amounts to Administrative Agent for application to the Obligations in accordance with Section 4.4.

Subject to Section 6.1(c) and (f), as applicable, any SOFR Loan or Canadian BA RateCORRA Loan or any portion thereof as to which Borrower Representative has not duly specified an Interest Period as provided herein shall be 93 7951095.17951095.8 

deemed a SOFR Loan or Canadian BA RateCORRA Loan, as applicable, with an Interest Period of one (1) month. (b) Interest Periods. In connection with each SOFR Loan or Canadian BA RateCORRA Loan, Borrower Representative, on behalf of the applicable Borrower, by giving notice at the times described in Section 2.3 or 6.2, as applicable, shall elect an Interest Period to be applicable to such Revolving Loan, which Interest Period shall be a period of one (1) month, three (3) months or six (6) months (or if available and approved by all Lenders, twelve (12) months) thereafter in the case of a SOFR Loan and one (1) month, two (2) months or (3) months, or if available, six (6) months, and (or if available and approved by all Lenders, six (6) months, or twelve (12) months), in the case of a Canadian BA RateCORRA Loan; provided, that: (i) the Interest Period shall commence on the date of advance of or conversion to any SOFR Loan and, in the case of immediately successive Interest Periods, each successive Interest Period shall commence on the date on which the immediately preceding Interest Period expires; (ii) if any Interest Period would otherwise expire on a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Period shall expire on the next succeeding Business Day; provided, that, if any Interest Period with respect to a SOFR Loan or Canadian BA RateCORRA Loan would otherwise expire on a day that is not a Business Day but is a day of the month after which no further Business Day occurs in such month, such Interest Period shall expire on the immediately preceding Business Day; (iii) any Interest Period with respect to a SOFR Loan or Canadian BA RateCORRA Loan that begins on the last Business Day of a calendar month (or on a day for which there is no numerically corresponding day in the calendar month at the end of such Interest Period) shall end on the last Business Day of the relevant calendar month at the end of such Interest Period; (iv) no Interest Period shall extend beyond the Maturity Date; (v) no tenor that has been removed from this definition pursuant to Section 6.1(g)(iv) shall be available for specification in any Notice of Borrowing or conversion or continuation notice; and (vi) there shall be no more than ten (10) Interest Periods for all SOFR Loans and Canadian BA RateCORRA Loans in effect at any time. (c) Default Rate. Subject to Section 11.3, (i) immediately upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default under Section 11.1(a), (b), (h) or (i), or (ii) at the election of the Required Lenders, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any other Event of Default, (A) the Borrowers shall no longer have the option to request SOFR Loans or Canadian BA RateCORRA Loans, (B) all outstanding SOFR Loans or Canadian BA RateCORRA Loans shall bear interest at a rate per annum of two percent (2 in excess of the rate (including the Applicable Margin) then applicable to SOFR Loans or Canadian BA RateCORRA Loans, as applicable, until the end of the applicable Interest Period and thereafter at a rate equal to two percent (2 in excess of the rate (including the Applicable Margin) then applicable to (1) US Base Rate Loans in the case of SOFR Loans denominated in Dollars or (2) Canadian Base Rate Loans in the case of Canadian BA RateCORRA Loans denominated in Canadian Dollars, (C) all outstanding US Base Rate Loans and other US Obligations arising hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to two percent (2 in excess of the rate (including the Applicable Margin) then applicable to US Base Rate Loans or such other US Obligations arising hereunder or under any other Loan Document, (D) all outstanding Canadian Base Rate Loans and other Canadian Obligations arising hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to two percent (2 in excess of the rate (including the Applicable 94 7951095.17951095.8 Margin) then applicable to Canadian Base Rate Loans or such other Canadian Obligations arising hereunder or under any other Loan Document, (E) letter of credit commissions and letter of credit fees shall bear interest at a rate per annum of two percent (2 in excess of the rate that would otherwise be applicable thereto, and (F) all accrued and unpaid interest shall be due and payable on demand of Administrative Agent. Interest shall continue to accrue on the Obligations after the filing by or against any Borrower of any petition seeking any relief in bankruptcy or Debtor Relief Law. (d) Interest Payment and Computation. (i) Interest on each Base Rate Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on the first day of each calendar quarter commencing July 1, 2021, and interest on each SOFR Loan and Canadian BA RateCORRA Loan shall be due and payable on the last day of each Interest Period applicable thereto, and if such Interest Period extends over three (3) months, at the end of each three (3) month interval during such Interest Period (but in any event all interest shall be payable on the Maturity Date). All computations of interest for US Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is determined by the Prime Rate and all computations of interest for Canadian Base Rate Loans and Canadian BA RateCORRA Loans shall be made on the basis of a year of three hundred sixty-five (365) or three hundred sixty-six (366) days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest provided hereunder shall be made on the basis of a three hundred sixty (360) day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a three hundred sixty-five (365)/three hundred sixty-six (366) day year). (ii) For greater certainty, whenever any amount is payable under this Agreement or any other Loan Document by the Canadian Borrower as interest or as a fee which requires the calculation of an amount using a percentage per annum, each party to this Agreement acknowledges and agrees that such amount shall be calculated as of the date payment is due without application of the deemed reinvestment principle or the effective yield method (e.g., when interest is calculated and payable monthly, the rate of interest payable per month is 1/12 of the stated rate of interest per annum). (iii) For the purposes of the Interest Act (Canada) and disclosure under such Act, whenever interest to be paid under this Agreement is to be calculated on the basis of a year of three hundred sixty-five (365) or three hundred sixty-six (366) days or any other period of time that is less than a calendar year, the yearly rate of interest to which the rate determined pursuant to such calculation is equivalent is the rate so determined multiplied by the actual number of days in the calendar year in which the same is to be ascertained and divided by either three hundred sixty-five (365) or three hundred sixty-six (366) days or such other period of time, as the case may be. (e) Maximum Rate. (i) In no contingency or event whatsoever shall the aggregate of all amounts deemed interest under this Agreement charged or collected pursuant to the terms of this Agreement exceed the highest rate permissible under any Applicable Law, which a court of competent jurisdiction shall, in a final determination, deem applicable hereto. Subject to clause (ii) below, in the event that such a court determines that the Lenders have charged or received interest hereunder in excess of the highest permissible rate, the rate in effect hereunder shall automatically be reduced to the maximum rate permitted by Applicable Law and the Lenders shall at Administrative Agent s option (i) promptly refund to the applicable Borrower any interest received by the Lenders in excess of the maximum lawful rate or (ii) apply such excess to the principal balance of the US Obligations or the Canadian Obligations, as applicable, on a pro rata basis. It is the intent hereof that the Borrowers not pay or contract to pay, and that neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender receive or contract to receive, directly or indirectly in 95 7951095.17951095.8 any manner whatsoever, interest in excess of that which may be paid by the Borrowers under Applicable Law. (ii) If any provision of this Agreement or of any of the other Loan Documents would obligate the Canadian Borrower or any other Canadian Credit Party to make any payment of interest or other amount payable to any Canadian Lender in an amount or calculated at a rate which would result in a receipt by such Canadian Lender of interest at a criminal rate (as such terms are construed under the Criminal Code (Canada)) then, notwithstanding such provisions, such amount or rate shall be deemed to have been adjusted with retroactive effect to the maximum amount or rate of interest, as the case may be, as would not be so prohibited by law or so result in a receipt by such Canadian Lender of interest at a criminal rate, such adjustment to be effected, to the extent necessary, as follows: (A) firstly, by reducing the amount or rate of interest required to be paid to such Canadian Lender on Canadian Revolving Loans, and (B) thereafter, by reducing any fees, commissions, premiums and other amounts required to be paid to such Canadian Lender which would constitute interest for purposes of Section 347 of the Criminal Code (Canada). Any amount or rate of interest referred to in this Section 6.1 shall be determined in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices and principles as an effective annual rate of interest over the term that the applicable Canadian Revolving Loan remains outstanding on the assumption that any charges, fees or expenses that fall within the meaning of interest (as defined in the Criminal Code (Canada)) shall, if they relate to a specific period of time, be prorated over that period of time and otherwise be pro-rated over the period from the Restatement Date to the date set out in clause (a) of the definition of Maturity Date and, in the event of a dispute, a certificate of a Fellow of the Canadian Institute of Actuaries appointed by Administrative Agent shall be conclusive for the purposes of such determination. (f) Term SOFR Conforming Changes. In connection with the use or administration of Term SOFR, Administrative Agent, after consultation with Borrower Representative, will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document. Administrative Agent will promptly notify Borrower Representative and the Lenders of the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes in connection with the use or administration of Term SOFR. (g) Benchmark Replacement Setting. (i) Benchmark Replacement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document (and any Hedge Agreement shall be deemed not to be a Loan Document for purposes of this Section 6.1(g)), if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred, Administrative Agent, with Borrower Representative s approval, may amend this Agreement to replace the then-current Benchmark with a Benchmark Replacement determined in accordance with the definition of Benchmark Replacement for such Benchmark Replacement Date which will replace the then current Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without any further amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document provided that any such amendment with respect to a Benchmark Transition Event will become effective at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth (5th) Business Day after Administrative Agent has posted such proposed amendment to all affected Lenders and Borrower Representative so long as Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such amendment from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders. 96 7951095.17951095.8 (ii) Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes. In connection with the direct use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, Administrative Agent, after consultation with Borrower Representative, will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document. (iii) Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations. Administrative Agent will promptly notify Borrower Representative and the Lenders of (A) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement and (B) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes. Administrative Agent will notify Borrower Representative of (1) to the extent that Administrative Agent is providing notices thereof generally to borrowers under asset-based credit facilities, and Borrower Representative does not otherwise have notice thereof, any occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date, (2) the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to Section 6.1(g)(iv) and (3) the commencement of any Benchmark Unavailability Period and to the extent that Administrative Agent is providing notices thereof generally to borrowers under asset-based credit facilities, and Borrower Representative does not otherwise have notice thereof, the conclusion of such Benchmark Unavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by Administrative Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 6.1(g)(iii), including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 6.1(g)(iii). (iv) Unavailability of Tenor of Benchmark. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (A) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including the Term SOFR Reference Rate or the Canadian BATerm CORRA Reference Rate) and either (1) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (2) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is not or will be no longer representative, then Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period (or any similar or analogous definition) for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (B) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (A) above either (1) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (2) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is not or will no longer be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period (or any similar or analogous definition) for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor. (v) Benchmark Unavailability Period. Upon Borrower Representative's receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, (A) Borrower Representative may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of SOFR Loans or Canadian BA RateCORRA Loans, as applicable, to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, Borrower Representative will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans and (B) any outstanding affected SOFR Loans or Canadian BA RateCORRA Loans will be deemed to have been converted to Base Rate Loans at the end of the applicable Interest Period. During any Benchmark 97 7951095.17951095.8 

Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of the Base Rate based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of the Base Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, Borrowers shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted (but not in duplicate), together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 6.9. During a Benchmark Unavailability Period with respect to any Benchmark or at any time that a tenor for any then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of the Base Rate based upon the then-current Benchmark that is the subject of such Benchmark Unavailability Period or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of the applicable Base Rate. (h) No Requirement of Matched Funding. Anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, neither Administrative Agent, nor any Lender, nor any of their Participants, is required actually to match fund any Obligation as to which interest accrues at Term SOFR or the Term SOFR Reference Rate or the Canadian Base Rate or the CDOR RateTerm CORRA.

SECTION 6.5 [Reserved]. SECTION 6.6 Sharing of Payments by Lenders. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or other obligations hereunder resulting in such Lender s receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and accrued interest thereon or other such obligations (other than pursuant to Sections 6.9, 6.10, 6.11 or 13.3) greater than its Commitment Percentage thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and such other obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and other amounts owing them; provided, that: (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to (A) any payment made by the Borrowers pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), (B) the application of Cash Collateral provided for in Section 6.14 or (C) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Revolving Loans or participations in Swingline Loans and Letters of Credit to any assignee or participant, other than to Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Credit Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under Applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against each Credit Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of each Credit Party in the amount of such participation. 100 7951095.17951095.8 SECTION 6.7 Administrative Agent s Clawback. (a) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender (i) in the case of US Base Rate Loans and Canadian Base Rate Loans, not later than 12:00 noon on the Funding Date of any Borrowing and (ii) otherwise, prior to the Funding Date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to Administrative Agent such Lender s share of such Borrowing, Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Sections 2.3(b), 4.2(b) and 5.2 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the applicable Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, (1) with respect to any Revolving Loan denominated in Dollars, the greater of (x) the daily average Federal Funds Rate and (y) a rate determined by Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (2) with respect to any Revolving Loan denominated in Canadian Dollars, the greater of (x) a rate equal to Administrative Agent s aggregate marginal cost (including the cost of maintaining any required reserves or deposit insurance and of any fees, penalties, overdraft charges or other costs or expenses incurred by Administrative Agent as a result of the failure to deliver funds hereunder) of carrying such amount and (y) a rate determined by Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by such Borrower, (1) with respect to any Revolving Loan denominated in Dollars, the interest rate applicable to US Base Rate Loans and (2) with respect to any Revolving Loan denominated in Canadian Dollars, a rate equal to Administrative Agent s aggregate marginal cost (including the cost of maintaining any required reserves or deposit insurance and of any fees, penalties, overdraft charges or other costs or expenses incurred by Administrative Agent as a result of the failure to deliver funds hereunder) of carrying such amount. If the applicable Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to such Borrower the amount of such interest paid by such Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Revolving Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by any Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim such Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to Administrative Agent. (b) Payments by the Borrowers; Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrowers prior to the date on which any payment is due to Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender hereunder that the applicable Borrower will not make such payment, Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the applicable Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case maybe, severally agrees to repay to Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender, Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to Administrative Agent, (i) with respect to any US Extension of Credit, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (ii) with respect to any Canadian Extension of Credit, at a rate equal to Administrative Agent s aggregate marginal cost (including the cost of maintaining any required reserves or deposit 101 7951095.17951095.8 

insurance and of any fees, penalties, overdraft charges or other costs or expenses incurred by Administrative Agent as a result of the failure to deliver funds hereunder) of carrying such amount. (c) Nature of Obligations of Lenders Regarding Extensions of Credit. The obligations of the Lenders under this Agreement to make the Revolving Loans and issue or participate in Letters of Credit are several and are not joint or joint and several. The failure of any Lender to make available its Commitment Percentage of any Revolving Loan requested by any Borrower shall not relieve it or any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Commitment Percentage of such Revolving Loan available on the Funding Date of the Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make its Commitment Percentage of such Revolving Loan available on the Funding Date of such Borrowing. SECTION 6.8 Changed Circumstances. (a) Circumstances Affecting SOFR or Canadian BA RateCORRA Availability. If in connection with any request for a SOFR Loan or Canadian BA RateCORRA Loan or a US Base Rate Loan or Canadian Base Rate Loan, as applicable, as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to Term SOFR or the Canadian BA RateTerm CORRA, as the case may be, or a conversion to or continuation thereof, if for any reason (i) Administrative Agent shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that Dollar or Canadian Dollar, as applicable, deposits are not being offered to banks for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Revolving Loan, or in the applicable Canadian market in the case of the Canadian BATerm CORRA Rate, (ii) Administrative Agent shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that reasonable and adequate means do not exist for ascertaining Term SOFR for such Interest Period with respect to a proposed SOFR Loan or Canadian BATerm CORRA Rate or any US Base Rate Loan or any Canadian Base Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to Term SOFR or Canadian BA RateTerm CORRA, as the case may be, or (iii) the Required Lenders shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that Term SOFR or the Canadian BA RateTerm CORRA, as applicable, does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining such Revolving Loans during such Interest Period, then Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Borrowers. Thereafter, as of the date specified in the notice from Administrative Agent, until Administrative Agent notifies the Borrowers that such circumstances no longer exist, the obligation of the Lenders to make SOFR Loans or Canadian BA RateCORRA Loans, as the case may be, and the right of any Borrower to convert any Revolving Loan to or continue any Revolving Loan as a SOFR Loan or Canadian BA RateTerm CORRA, as applicable, shall be suspended, and (i) in the case of SOFR Loans and CORRA Loans, each Borrower shall either (A) repay in full (or cause to be repaid in full) the then outstanding principal amount of each such SOFR Loan or Canadian BA RateCORRA Loan, as the case may be, made to it together with accrued interest thereon (subject to Section 6.1(d)), on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such SOFR Loan or Canadian BA RateCORRA Loan; or (B) convert the then outstanding principal amount of each such SOFR Loan made to it to a US Base Rate Loan or such Canadian BA RateCORRA Loan made to it to a Canadian Base Rate Loan, as applicable, as to which the interest rate is not determined by reference to Term SOFR or the Canadian BA RateTerm CORRA, as of the last day of such Interest Period; or (ii) in the case of US Base Rate Loans or CORRA Loans, the interest rate shall cease to be determined by reference to Term SOFR or Term CORRA, as applicable as of the last day of such Interest Period. (b) Laws Affecting Term SOFR or Canadian BA RateTerm CORRA Availability. In the event that any change in market conditions or any Change in Law shall at any time after the date hereof, in the reasonable opinion of any Lender, make it unlawful or impractical for such Lender to fund or maintain SOFR Loans or Canadian BA RateCORRA Loans or to continue such funding or maintaining, 102 7951095.17951095.8 or to determine or charge interest rates at the rate of interest applicable to any SOFR Loan or any Canadian BA RateCORRA Loan, as the case may be, such Lender shall give notice of such changed circumstances to Administrative Agent and Borrower Representative and Administrative Agent promptly shall transmit the notice to each other Lender and (i) in the case of any SOFR Loans or any Canadian BA RateCORRA Loans as the case may be, of such Lender that are outstanding, the date specified in such Lender s notice shall be deemed to be the last day of the Interest Period of such SOFR Loans or such Canadian BA RateCORRA Loans, as the case may be, and interest upon the SOFR Loans or the Canadian BA RateCORRA Loans, as the case may be, of such Lender thereafter shall accrue interest at the rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans, and (ii) Borrowers shall not be entitled to borrow SOFR Loans or Canadian BA RateCORRA Loans until such Lender determines that it would no longer be unlawful or impractical to do so. SECTION 6.9 Indemnity. Each Borrower hereby indemnifies each of the Lenders against any loss or expense (including any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain a SOFR Loan or Canadian BA RateCORRA Loan made to such Borrower or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained, but excluding loss of profit) which may arise or be attributable to each Lender s obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits or other funds acquired to effect, fund or maintain any Revolving Loan to such Borrower (a) as a consequence of any failure by any Borrower to make any payment when due of any amount due hereunder in connection with a SOFR Loan or Canadian BA RateCORRA Loan, (b) due to any failure of such Borrower to borrow, continue or convert into a SOFR Loan or Canadian BA RateCORRA Loan on a date specified therefor in a Borrowing request or Notice of Conversion/Continuation or (c) due to any payment, prepayment or conversion of any SOFR Loan or Canadian BA RateCORRA Loan made to such Borrower on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor. The amount of such loss or expense shall be determined, in the applicable Lender s sole discretion, based upon the assumption that such Lender funded its Commitment Percentage of the SOFR Loans or of the Canadian BA RateCORRA Loan in the applicable market and using any reasonable attribution or averaging methods which such Lender deems appropriate and practical. A certificate of such Lender setting forth the basis for determining such amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender shall be forwarded to the Borrower Representative, through Administrative Agent and shall be conclusively presumed to be correct save for demonstrable error. SECTION 6.10 Increased Costs. (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall: (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or advances, loans or other credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in SOFR) or the Issuing Bank; (ii) subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (f) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or (iii) impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or SOFR Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender, the Issuing Bank or 103 7951095.17951095.8 such other Recipient of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Revolving Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Revolving Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender, the Issuing Bank or such other Recipient of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender, the Issuing Bank or other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon written request of such Lender, the Issuing Bank or other Recipient, the Borrowers shall pay to any such Lender, the Issuing Bank or other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender, the Issuing Bank or other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. (b) Capital Requirements. If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or the Issuing Bank or any lending office of such Lender or such Lender s or the Issuing Bank s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s or the Issuing Bank s capital or on the capital of such Lender s or the Issuing Bank s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitment or Canadian Commitment, as applicable, of such Lender or the Revolving Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender s or the Issuing Bank s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s or the Issuing Bank s policies and the policies of such Lender s or the Issuing Bank s holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time upon written request of such Lender or such Issuing Bank the Borrowers shall promptly pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender s or the Issuing Bank s holding company for any such reduction suffered. (c) Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender, the Issuing Bank or such other Recipient setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender, the Issuing Bank, such other Recipient or any of their respective holding companies, as the case may be, as specified in clause (a) or (b) of this Section 6.10 and delivered to the Borrowers, shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error. The Borrowers shall pay such Lender, the Issuing Bank or such other Recipient, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof. (d) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender, the Issuing Bank or such other Recipient to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 6.10 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s, the Issuing Bank s or such other Recipient s right to demand such compensation; provided, that the Borrowers shall not be required to compensate any Lender, the Issuing Bank or any other Recipient pursuant to this Section 6.10 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine (9) months prior to the date that such Lender, the Issuing Bank or such other Recipient, as the case may be, notifies the Borrowers of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions, and of such Lender s, the Issuing Bank s or such other Recipient s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine (9) month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). SECTION 6.11 Taxes. (a) Issuing Bank. For purposes of this Section 6.11, the term Lender includes the Issuing Bank. 104 7951095.17951095.8 (b) Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Credit Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by Applicable Law. If any Applicable Law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Credit Party shall be increased as necessary so that, after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 6.11), the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made. (c) Payment of Other Taxes by the Credit Parties. The Credit Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law, or at the option of Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes. (d) Indemnification by the Credit Parties. The Credit Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 6.11) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to Borrower Representative by a Recipient (with a copy to Administrative Agent), or by Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Recipient, shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error. (e) Indemnification by the Lenders. Each Lender shall severally indemnify Administrative Agent, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Credit Party has not already indemnified Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Credit Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 13.10(d) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error. Each Lender hereby authorizes Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to Administrative Agent under this clause (e). (f) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Credit Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 6.11, such Credit Party shall deliver to Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent. (g) Status of Lenders. 105 7951095.17951095.8 

(i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to Borrower Representative and Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by Borrower Representative or Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by Borrower Representative or Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by Borrower Representative or Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by Applicable Law or reasonably requested by Borrower Representative or Administrative Agent as will enable Borrower Representative or Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 6.11(g)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that any Borrower is a US Person: (A) any Lender that is a US Person shall deliver to Borrower Representative and Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of Borrower Representative or Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from United States federal backup withholding tax; (B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to Borrower Representative and Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of Borrower Representative or Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: (1) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, United States federal withholding Tax pursuant to the interest article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, United States federal withholding Tax pursuant to the business profits or other income article of such tax treaty; (2) executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI; (3) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit L-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a 10-percent shareholder of any Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a US Tax Compliance Certificate and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable; or 106 7951095.17951095.8 (4) to the extent a foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, a US Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit L-2 or Exhibit L-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided, that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a US Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit L-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; (C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to Borrower Representative and Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of Borrower Representative or Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by Applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by Applicable Law to permit Borrower Representative or Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and (D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to United States federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to Borrower Representative and Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by Borrower Representative or Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by Applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by Borrower Representative or Administrative Agent as may be necessary for Borrower Representative and Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify Borrower Representative and Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so; provided, that no such updating or notification is required to be made on account of any Canadian withholding tax if no form or certification has been previously delivered for Canadian withholding tax purposes. (h) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to Section 6.10 or this Section 6.11 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to Section 6.10 or this Section 6.11), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under Section 6.10 or this Section 6.11 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this clause (h) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this clause (h), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this clause (h) the payment of which 107 7951095.17951095.8 would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This clause (h) shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person. (i) Survival. Each party s obligations under this Section 6.11 shall survive the resignation or replacement of Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document. SECTION 6.12 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a) Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender delivers a notice under Section 6.8(b), requests compensation under Section 6.10, or requires any Borrower to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 6.11, then such Lender shall, at the request of the Borrowers, use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Revolving Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would permit the withdrawal of the notice under Section 6.8(b) or (ii) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 6.10 or Section 6.11, as the case may be, in the future, and in each case, would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrowers hereby agree to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. (b) Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender delivers a notice under Section 6.8(b), requests compensation under Section 6.10, or if the Borrowers are required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 6.11, and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 6.12(a), or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or a Non-Consenting Lender, then the Borrowers may, at their sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 13.10), all of its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Section 6.10 or Section 6.11) and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided, that: (i) the Borrowers shall have paid to Administrative Agent the assignment fee (if any) specified in Section 13.10; (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Revolving Loans and funded participations in Letters of Credit, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 6.9) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrowers (in the case of all other amounts); (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 6.10 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 6.11, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; 108 7951095.17951095.8 (iv) such assignment does not conflict with Applicable Law; and (v) in the case of any assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non- Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrowers to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. SECTION 6.13 Incremental Commitments. (a) At any time after the Restatement Date, Borrower Representative may by written notice to Administrative Agent (which shall promptly deliver such notice to each Lender) elect to request one or more increases in the US Commitments or Canadian Commitments (any such increase, an Incremental Commitment ), provided, that, (i) the total aggregate principal amount for all such Incremental Commitments shall not (as of any date of incurrence thereof) exceed 800,000,000, (ii) the total aggregate principal amount for all such Incremental Commitments for US Commitments shall not exceed 750,000,000, (iii) the total aggregate principal amount for all such Incremental Commitments for Canadian Commitments shall not exceed 50,000,000 and (iv) the total aggregate amount for each request for Incremental Commitments shall not be less than a minimum principal amount of 10,000,000 or, if less, the remaining amount permitted pursuant to the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) as applicable. Each such notice shall specify the date (each, an Increase Effective Date on which Borrower Representative proposes that any Incremental Commitment shall be effective, which shall be a date not less than ten (10) Business Days after the date on which such notice is delivered to Administrative Agent (or such later date acceptable to Administrative Agent). Upon notice to Administrative Agent, Borrower Representative may invite any Lender, any Affiliate of any Lender and/or any Approved Fund, and/or any other Person reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent, Swingline Lender and each Issuing Bank to provide an Incremental Commitment (any such Person, an Incremental Lender ). Any proposed Incremental Lender offered or approached to provide all or a portion of any Incremental Commitment may elect or decline, in its sole discretion, to provide such Incremental Commitment. (b) Any Incremental Commitment shall become effective as of such Increase Effective Date; provided, that, as of the date of any such Facility Increase, and after giving effect thereto, (i) Borrowers shall deliver to Administrative Agent a certificate of each Credit Party dated as of the applicable Increase Effective Date signed by a Responsible Officer of such Credit Party (i) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by such Credit Party approving or consenting to such Incremental Commitment, and (ii) certifying that, before and after giving effect to such increase, the representations and warranties contained in Article VIII and each other Loan Document shall be true and correct in all material respects (except to the extent any such representation and warranty is already qualified by materiality or reference to a Material Adverse Effect, in which case, such representation and warranty shall be true, correct and complete in all respects) on such Increase Effective Date with the same effect as if made on and as of such date (except for any such representation and warranty that by its terms is made only as of an earlier date, which representation and warranty shall have been true and correct as of such earlier date); provided, that, in connection with any Incremental Commitment the proceeds of which are substantially concurrently with the receipt thereof to be used by Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to finance, in whole or in part, a Permitted Acquisition, then the only representations and warranties that will be required to be true and correct as of the funding of Revolving Loans in connection therewith shall be (A) the Specified Representations and (B) such of the representations and warranties made by or on behalf of the applicable acquired company or business (or the seller thereof) in the applicable acquisition agreement as are material to the interests of the Lenders, 109 7951095.17951095.8 

but only to the extent that Holdings (or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) has the right to terminate or elect not to perform its obligations under such acquisition agreement as a result of the inaccuracy of any such representations or warranties in such acquisition agreement); (ii) Borrowers shall have paid such fees and other compensation to Administrative Agent and Lenders as may be agreed; (iii) Borrowers shall deliver to Administrative Agent and Lenders an opinion or opinions, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent, from counsel to Borrowers reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent and dated the Increase Effective Date; (iv) Borrowers shall have delivered such other instruments, documents and agreements as Administrative Agent may have reasonably requested; (v) as of the Increase Effective Date and after giving effect thereto, no Specified Event of Default shall exist or have occurred and be continuing, provided, that, in connection with any Incremental Commitment to be used by Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to finance, in whole or in part, a Permitted Acquisition, then the conditions set forth in this clause (v) must only be satisfied at the time the acquisition agreement for such Permitted Acquisition is entered into; (vi) such Incremental Commitment shall be subject to obtaining additional Commitments of Lenders (whether existing Lenders or new Lenders), (vii) the terms of such Incremental Commitments shall be the same as for all other Commitments and Revolving Loans (other than as to fees payable for such Incremental Commitments). (c) In no event shall the fees, interest rate and other compensation offered or paid in respect of any Incremental Commitment have higher rates than the amounts paid and payable to the then existing Lenders in respect of their Commitments, unless the fees, interest rate and other compensation payable to the then existing Lenders are increased to the same as those paid in connection with the Incremental Commitments, except for the initial fee payable in respect of the Incremental Commitment of a Lender. (d) The outstanding Revolving Loans and Commitment Percentages of Swingline Loans and LC Obligations will be reallocated by Administrative Agent on the applicable Increase Effective Date among the Lenders (including the Incremental Lenders providing such Incremental Commitments) in accordance with their revised Commitment Percentages and the Lenders (including the Incremental Lenders providing such Incremental Commitment) agree to make all payments and adjustments necessary to effect such reallocation and Borrower Representative shall pay any and all costs required pursuant to Section 6.9 in connection with such reallocation as if such reallocation were a repayment. To the extent that the Incremental Lender is not a Lender immediately prior to the Increase Effective Date, such Incremental Lender shall execute and deliver to Administrative Agent one or more Lender Joinder Agreements, which shall then be executed and delivered by Borrower Representative and Administrative Agent and if the Incremental Lender is a Lender immediately prior to the Increase Effective Date then such Incremental Lender shall execute and deliver such other agreement as Administrative Agent may require. Such Lender Joinder Agreement or other agreement, as the case may be, shall, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of this Section 6.13 and Administrative Agent is authorized to amend Schedule 1.1(a) to reflect the new Commitment Percentages without the consent of any Lender or other Person. The Incremental Lenders shall be included in any determination of the Required Lenders or Supermajority Lenders, as applicable, and, unless otherwise agreed, the Incremental Lenders will not constitute a separate voting class for any 110 7951095.17951095.8 purposes under this Agreement.

No reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender s increased exposure following such reallocation. (v) Cash Collateral, Repayment of Swingline Loans.

Each Credit Party hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes Holdings as the borrowing agent and attorney-in-fact for all Borrowers Borrower Representative which appointment shall remain in full force and effect unless and until Administrative Agent shall have received prior written notice signed by each Credit Party that such appointment has been revoked and that another Credit Party has been appointed Borrower Representative.

Each Borrower expects to derive benefit, directly or indirectly, from the handling of the Loan Account and the Collateral in a combined fashion since the successful operation of each Borrower is dependent on the continued successful performance of the integrated group. To induce the Lender Group to do so, and in consideration thereof, each Borrower hereby jointly and severally agrees to indemnify each member of the Lender Group and hold each member of the Lender Group harmless against any and all liability, expense, loss or claim of damage or injury, made against the Lender Group by any Borrower or by any third party whosoever, arising from or incurred by reason of (A) the handling of the Loan Account and Collateral of Borrowers as herein provided, or (B) the Lender Group s relying on any instructions of Borrower Representative; except, that, Borrowers will have no liability to Administrative Agent or its Related Parties or Lender or its Related Parties under this Section 6.16 with respect to any liability that has been finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted solely from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Administrative Agent or its Related Party or such Lender or its Related Party, as the case may be.
