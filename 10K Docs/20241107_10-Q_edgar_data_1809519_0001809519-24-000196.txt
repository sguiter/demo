 measurement alternative in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 321, Investments Equity 
 Securities , which is cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes. Due to 
 indicators of a decline in the financial condition of one of our investees, we recognized impairment losses of million and 
 million on one of our minority equity interest investments during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , 
 respectively, and presented as other expense in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the periods then 
 ended. We otherwise have not recognized any changes resulting from observable price changes or impairment losses on 
 our minority equity interest investments during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . Equity

 based compensation expense, state income taxes, benefits from research and development tax credits, and tax effects from 
 our equity awards. The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was further impacted by the 
 release of our valuation allowance against the majority of our net deferred tax assets recorded as a discrete tax benefit

 For further details of the material terms of our First Lien Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility prior to the July 10, 
 2024 amendment, refer to Note 12 in the consolidated financial statements included in our 2023 10-K. 
 On July 10, 2024, we entered into the Sixth Amendment to First Lien Credit Agreement (the "Sixth Amendment") to, 
 among other things, (i) establish a million term loan (the 2024 Term Loan Facility that matures on July 10, 2029 (ii) 
 extend the maturity on million of the Revolving Credit Facility to April 10, 2029 and (iii) immaterially modify certain 
 covenants. The remaining million of the Revolving Credit Facility not subject to the maturity extension will terminate on 
 July 11, 2025 . Concurrent with the closing of the Sixth Amendment, we repaid the First Lien Term Loan Facility in full using 
 all of the proceeds from the 2024 Term Loan Facility (after giving effect to a million cashless roll by continuing lende rs 
 and cash on hand. The 2024 Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility are collateralized by substantially all of our 
 assets and of the equity interest of GoodRx. 
 The 2024 Term Loan Facility bears interest, at our option, at either (i) a term rate based on the Secured Overnight 
 Financing Rate, subject to a floor of , plus a margin of ; or (ii) an alternate base rate plus a margin of . 
 Interest is paid monthly. The 2024 Term Loan Facility requires quarterly principal payments of million beginning with the 
 quarter ending March 31, 2025 , with any remaining unpaid principal and any accrued interest due upon maturity. We may 
 make voluntary prepayments of the 2024 Term Loan Facility from time to time, and we are required in certain instances 
 related to asset dispositions, casualty events, non-permitted debt issuances and annual excess cash flow, to make 
 mandatory prepayments of the 2024 Term Loan Facility. 
 In connection with the Sixth Amendment, we recognized a million loss on the extinguishment of debt related to the 
 write-off of a portion of existing unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts. Third-party transaction costs incurred 
 related to the 2024 Term Loan Facility was million , of which million were expensed as incurred as other expense in 
 our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . T he 
 remaining third-party transaction costs along with a million original issue discount were presented as a reduction of 
 debt, ne t on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 .

of these plaintiffs additionally brings a claim under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. The fifth 
 plaintiff brings claims for common-law unjust enrichment and violations of New York s General Business Law. Four of these 
 cases were originally filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California ("NDCA) (Cases No. 3:23- 
 cv-00501; 3:23-cv-00744; 3:23-cv-00940; and 4:23-cv-01293). One case was originally filed in the United States District 
 Court for the Southern District of New York (Case No. 1:23-cv-00943); however, that case was voluntarily dismissed and re- 
 filed in the NDCA (Case No. 3:23-cv-01508). These matters have been consolidated and assigned to U.S. District Judge 
 Araceli Mart nez-Olgu n in the NDCA. The court also set a briefing schedule for filing a single consolidated complaint, which 
 the plaintiffs filed on May 21, 2023 (Case No. 3:23-cv-00501-AMO; the "NDCA Class Action Matter"), as well as motions to 
 dismiss and motions to compel arbitration. In addition to the aforementioned claims, the plaintiffs in the now consolidated 
 matter bring claims under the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, common law negligence and 
 negligence per se, in each case, pleaded in the alternative. The plaintiffs are seeking various forms of monetary damages 
 (such as statutory damages, compensatory damages, attorneys fees and disgorgement of profits) as well as injunctive 
 relief. Briefing on the motions to dismiss and motions to compel arbitration was completed on August 24, 2023. 
 On October 27, 2023, plaintiffs filed a class action complaint (Case No. 1:23-cv-24127-BB; the SDFL Class Action 
 Matter against us in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida ("SDFL"). The plaintiffs alleged, on 
 behalf of the same nationwide class as the NDCA Class Action Matter, substantially the same statutory and common law 
 violation claims as alleged in that matter as well as claims based on the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 
 invasion of privacy under California common law and the California constitution, invasion of privacy under New Jersey's 
 Constitution, and violations of Pennsylvania s Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act, Florida s Security of 
 Communications Act, New York s Civil Rights Law and Stop Hack and Improve Electronic Data Security Act. The plaintiffs in 
 the SDFL Class Action Matter seek various forms of monetary damages as well as injunctive and other unspecified equitable 
 relief. 
 On October 27, 2023, we entered into a proposed settlement agreement with the plaintiffs in the SDFL Class Action 
 Matter, on behalf of a nationwide settlement class that includes the NDCA Class Action Matter, which provides for a payment 
 of million by us. On October 30, 2023, the plaintiffs in the SDFL Class Action Matter filed a motion and memorandum 
 in support of preliminary approval of the proposed class action settlement and, on October 31, 2023, the SDFL granted 
 preliminary approval of the proposed settlement. The proposed settlement is subject to final approval of the court. Members 
 of the class have the opportunity to opt-out of the class and commence their own actions. 
 In response to the proposed settlement in the SDFL Class Action Matter, plaintiffs in the NDCA Class Action Matter filed 
 (i) on November 1, 2023, a motion in the NDCA for an order to require us to cease litigation of, or alternatively file a motion 
 to stay in, the SDFL Class Action Matter and enjoin us from seeking settlement with counsel other than plaintiffs counsel in 
 the NDCA Class Action Matter; and (ii) on November 2, 2023, a motion in the SDFL for that court to allow them to intervene 
 and appear in the SDFL action, transfer the SDFL Class Action Matter to the NDCA and reconsider and deny its preliminary 
 approval of the proposed settlement. The SDFL has issued an order requiring the SDFL plaintiffs to, among other things, file 
 a response to the NDCA plaintiffs' motion to intervene. Additionally, U.S. District Judge Araceli Mart nez-Olgu n in the NDCA 
 issued an order for us to show cause as to why we should not be sanctioned for an alleged failure to provide notification to 
 the NDCA of the pendency of the SDFL Class Action Matter. We filed our written response to this order on November 8, 
 2023. The NDCA held a hearing on November 14, 2023, and ordered parties to the litigation to participate in mediation. The 
 parties participated in mediation on January 10, 2024, a nd have agreed to participate in an additional day of mediation, 
 which occurred on March 7, 2024 . Negotiations between the parties remain ongoing. 
 Based on the proposed settlement agreement, we determined that an estimated million loss was probable and 
 accrued million as of December 31, 2023, net of an initial million payment to a third-party qualified settlement 
 fund that we do not own that will be disbursed to the plaintiffs if required conditions are satisfied. Based on ongoing 
 negotiations and mediation between the parties, we determined the estimated probable loss to be million and 
 recognized the incremental loss during the three months ended March 31, 2024. The million estimated net liability 
 remains accrued within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of 
 September 30, 2024. While this amount represents our best judgment of the probable loss based on the information 
 currently available to us, it is subject to significant judgments and estimates and numerous factors beyond our control, 
 including, without limitation, final approval of the court or the results of mediation. In addition, while it is reasonably possible 
 an incremental loss may have been incurred for the indemnification of certain parties named in the class action lawsuits, a 
 loss, or a range of loss, is not reasonably estimable. The results of legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and upon final 
 resolution of these matters, it is reasonably possible that the actual loss may differ from our estimate. 
 On April 22, 2024, Lisa Marie Barsuli, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, filed a class action 
 lawsuit against us and certain of our executive officers in the United States District Court for the Central District of California 
 (Case No. 2:24-cv-3282). The plaintiffs seek compensatory damages and equitable relief as well as interest, fees and costs. 
 The complaint alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, 
 and asserts that we and certain of our executive officers failed to disclose to investors the risk relating to a grocery chain 
 taking actions that impacted acceptance of our discounted pricing for a subset of prescription drugs from PBMs, whose 
 pricing we promote on our platform (the grocer issue ), which occurred late in the first quarter of 2022. As alleged in the 
 complaint, when we disclosed the occurrence of the grocer issue, our stock price fell, causing investor losses. On July 25, 
 2024, U.S. District Judge Andr Birotte Jr. appointed The Kalmanson Family as the lead plaintiff and approved selection of

 stock repurchase program which authorized the repurchase of up to an aggregate of million of our Class A common 
 stock with no expiration date. Repurchases under these repurchase programs may be made in the open market, in privately 
 negotiated transactions or otherwise, with the amount and timing of repurchases to be determined at our discretion, 
 depending on market conditions and corporate needs, or under a trading plan intended to satisfy the affirmative defense

 particular amount of Class A common stock and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time at the discretion of

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with 
 our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report 
 on Form 10-Q, as well as Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
 Operations and Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in our Annual Report on Form 10- 
 K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on February 29, 
 2024 2023 10-K ). This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs 
 involving risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking 
 statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in the "Risk Factors" section of our 2023 10-K and other 
 factors set forth in other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our filings with the SEC. 
 
 Glossary of Selected Terminology 
 As used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, unless the context otherwise requires, references to: 
 we , us , our , the Company , GoodRx , and similar references refer to GoodRx Holdings, Inc. and its 
 consolidated subsidiaries. 
 Co-Founders refers to Trevor Bezdek, our Chairman and a director of the Company, and Douglas Hirsch , a 
 director of the Company. 
 consumers refer to the general population in the United States that uses or otherwise purchases healthcare 
 products and services. References to our consumers or GoodRx consumers refer to consumers that 
 have used one or more of our offerings. 
 discounted price refers to a price for a prescription provided on our platform that represents a negotiated 
 rate provided by one of our PBM partners at a retail pharmacy or under a direct contract with one of our 
 partner pharmacies. Through our platform, our discounted prices are free to access for consumers by saving a 
 GoodRx code to their mobile device for their selected prescription and presenting it at the chosen pharmacy. 
 The term discounted price excludes prices we may otherwise source, such as prices from patient assistance 
 programs for low-income individuals and Medicare prices, and any negotiated rates offered through our 
 subscription offerings: GoodRx Gold Gold ), and Kroger Rx Savings Club powered by GoodRx Kroger 
 Savings . 
 GoodRx code refers to codes that can be accessed by our consumers through our apps or websites or that 
 can be provided to our consumers directly by healthcare professionals, including physicians and pharmacists, 
 that allow our consumers free access to our discounted prices or a lower list price for their prescriptions when 
 such code is presented at their chosen pharmacy. 
 Monthly Active Consumers refers to the number of unique consumers who have used a GoodRx code to 
 purchase a prescription medication in a given calendar month and have saved money compared to the list 
 price of the medication. A unique consumer who uses a GoodRx code more than once in a calendar month to 
 purchase prescription medications is only counted as one Monthly Active Consumer in that month. A unique 
 consumer who uses a GoodRx code in two or three calendar months within a quarter will be counted as a 
 Monthly Active Consumer in each such month. Monthly Active Consumers do not include subscribers to our 
 subscription offerings, consumers of our pharma manufacturer solutions offering, or consumers who used our 
 telehealth offering. When presented for a period longer than a month, Monthly Active Consumers is averaged 
 over the number of calendar months in such period. For example, a unique consumer who uses a GoodRx 
 code twice in January, but who did not use our prescription transactions offering again in February or March, is 
 counted as 1 in January and as 0 in both February and March, thus contributing 0.33 to our Monthly Active 
 Consumers for such quarter (average of 1, 0 and 0). A unique consumer who uses a GoodRx code in January 
 and in March, but did not use our prescription transactions offering in February, would be counted as 1 in 
 January, 0 in February and 1 in March, thus contributing 0.66 to our Monthly Active Consumers for such 
 quarter. Monthly Active Consumers from acquired companies are only included beginning in the first full 
 quarter following the acquisition. 
 " partner pharmacies " refers to select licensed pharmacies with whom we have direct contractual agreements. 
 PBM refers to a pharmacy benefit manager. PBMs aggregate demand to negotiate prescription medication 
 prices with pharmacies and pharma manufacturers. PBMs find most of their demand through relationships with 
 insurance companies and employers. However, nearly all PBMs also have consumer direct or cash network 
 pricing that they negotiate with pharmacies for consumers who choose to purchase prescriptions outside of 
 insurance. 
 pharma is an abbreviation for pharmaceutical. 
 savings, saved and similar references refer to the difference between the list price for a particular 
 prescription at a particular pharmacy and the price paid by the GoodRx consumer for that prescription utilizing 
 a GoodRx code available through our platform at that same pharmacy. In certain circumstances, we may show 

14 

Table of Contents 

a list price on our platform when such list price is lower than the negotiated price available using a GoodRx 
 code and, in certain circumstances, a consumer may use a GoodRx code and pay the list price at a pharmacy 
 if such list price is lower than the negotiated price available using a GoodRx code. We do not earn revenue 
 from such transactions, but our savings calculation includes an estimate of the savings achieved by the 
 consumer because our platform has directed the consumer to the pharmacy with the low list price. This 
 estimate of savings when the consumer pays the list price is based on internal data and is calculated as the 
 difference between the average list price across all pharmacies where GoodRx consumers paid the list price 
 and the average list price paid by consumers in the pharmacies to which we directed them. We do not 
 calculate savings based on insurance prices as we do not have information about a consumer s specific 
 coverage or price. We do not believe savings are representative or indicative of our revenue or results of 
 operations. 
 subscribers and similar references refers to our consumers that are subscribed to either of our subscription 
 offerings, Gold or Kroger Savings . References to subscription plans as of a particular date represents an active 
 subscription to either one of our aforementioned subscription offerings as of the specified date. Each 
 subscription plan may represent more than one subscriber since family subscription plans may include multiple 
 members. 
 Certain monetary amounts, percentages, and other figures included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been 
 subject to rounding adjustments. Percentage amounts included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have not in all cases 
 been calculated on the basis of such rounded figures, but on the basis of such amounts prior to rounding. For this reason, 
 percentage amounts in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may vary from those obtained by performing the same 
 calculations using the figures in our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly 
 Report on Form 10-Q. Certain other amounts that appear in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may not sum due to 
 rounding. 
 
 Overview 
 Our mission is to help Americans get the healthcare they need at a price they can afford. To achieve this, we are 
 building the leading consumer-focused digital healthcare platform in the United States. We believe our financial results 
 reflect the significant market demand for our offerings and the value that we provide to the broader healthcare ecosystem. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023 : 
 Revenue increased 8 to 195.3 million from 180.0 million ; 
 Adjusted Revenue increased 3 to 195.3 million from 190.0 million ; 
 Net income and net income margin were 4.0 million and 2.0 , respectively, compared to net loss and net 
 loss margin of 38.5 million and 21.4 , respectively; and 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin were 65.0 million and 33.3 , respectively, compared to 53.5 
 million and 28.1 , respectively. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023 : 
 Revenue increased 7 to 593.7 million from 553.6 million ; 
 Adjusted Revenue increased 5 to 593.7 million from 563.6 million ; 
 Net income and net income margin were 9.7 million and 1.6 , respectively, compared to 17.0 million and 
 3.1 , respectively; and 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin were 193.2 million and 32.5 , respectively, compared to 
 160.2 million and 28.4 , respectively. 
 Revenue, net income (loss) and net income (loss) margin are financial measures prepared in conformity with 
 accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted 
 EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation and presentation of Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, information about why we 
 consider Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin useful and a discussion of the material risks 
 and limitations of these measures, please see Key Financial and Operating Metrics Non-GAAP Financial Measures" 
 below. 
 Recently, we have seen rapid changes in the U.S. retail pharmacy landscape with Rite Aid's store closures in addition to 
 announcements of store closures and reduction of footprint from various other retail pharmacies, including Walgreens and 
 CVS. Future store closures and reduction of footprint from retail pharmacies are expected to have an immediate adverse 
 impact on our prescription volume and prescription transactions revenue. However, we believe this impact to be largely 
 transient as we expect prescription volume to migrate to other in-network pharmacies in the near term. As an extension of 
 the changing retail pharmacy landscape, we have seen and continue to expect heightened renegotiations between 

15 

Table of Contents 

pharmacies and PBMs as a result of the pharmacies' increased focus on rationalizing of their spending, which in turn has 
 had and may continue to have an impact on our prescription transactions revenue . 
 
 Key Financial and Operating Metrics 
 We use Monthly Active Consumers, subscription plans, Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 Margin to assess our performance, make strategic and offering decisions and build our financial projections. The number of 
 Monthly Active Consumers and subscription plans are key indicators of the scale of our consumer base and a gauge for our 
 marketing and engagement efforts. We believe these operating metrics reflect our scale, growth and engagement with 
 consumers. 
 We exited the third quarter of 2024 with over 7 million p rescription-related consumers that used GoodRx across our 
 prescription transactions and subscription offerings. Our prescription-related consumers represent the sum of Monthly Active 
 Consumers for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and subscribers to our subscription plans as of September 30, 
 2024 . 
 Monthly Active Consumers 
 Consumer demand for our prescription transactions offering is subject to seasonality. We typically experience stronger 
 consumer demand during the first and fourth quarters of each year. For our integrated savings programs, we may 
 experience stronger traffic during the first half of each year since more claims are likely to be routed through GoodRx while 
 plan members are in the deductible phase of their health plans. For further information regarding seasonality, refer to Part II, 
 Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our 2023 10- 
 K.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are key measures we use to assess our financial 
 performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties because they can assist 
 in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. In addition, 
 these measures are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate and assess performance. 
 We define Adjusted Revenue for a particular period as revenue excluding client contract termination costs associated 
 with restructuring related activities. We exclude these costs from revenue because we believe they are not indicative of past 
 or future underlying performance of the business. 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income or loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and 
 amortization, and as further adjusted, as applicable, for acquisition related expenses, stock-based compensation expense, 
 payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation, loss on extinguishment of debt, financing related expenses, loss 
 on operating lease assets, restructuring related expenses, legal settlement expenses, charitable stock donation, gain on 
 sale of business and other income or expense, net. Adjusted EBITDA Margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage 
 of Adjusted Revenue. 
 Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures and are 
 presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered as alternatives or substitutes to 
 financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not 
 include the impact of certain costs that are reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of operations that are 
 necessary to run our business. Other companies, including other companies in our industry, may not use these measures or

may calculate these measures differently than as presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, limiting their usefulness

Revenue 
 All of our revenue has been generated in the United States. 
 Prescription transactions revenue increased 5.0 million , or 4 , year-over-year, primarily as a result of a 7 increase in 
 the number of our Monthly Active Consumers from organic growth , including expansion of our integrated savings program, 
 which integrates our discounts and pricing in a seamless experience at the pharmacy counter for eligible plan members 
 served by certain PBM partners. We estimate the recently a nnounced Rite Aid's store closures to have a mid-single-digit 
 million dollar impact on prescription transactions revenue in the second half of 2024 with approximately half of this impact 
 expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2024 . 
 Subscription revenue decreased 1.9 million , or 8 , year-over-year, primarily driven by a decrease in the number of 
 subscription plans due to the sunset of Kroger Savings with 701 thousand subscription plans as of September 30, 2024 
 compared to 930 thousand as of September 30, 2023 . Kroger Savings contributed 2.1 million of subscription revenue in the 
 third quarter 2023 and nil for the same period of 2024. Given the subscription fee is higher for Gold relative to Kroger 
 Savings, the sunset of Kroger Savings resulted in a higher year-over-year decline in subscription plans relative to 
 subscription revenue. 
 Pharma manufacturer solutions revenue increased 12.2 million , or 77 , year-over-year, primarily driven by a 10.0 
 million client contract termination payment, which was recognized as a reduction of revenue in the prior year quarter, related 
 to the restructuring of our pharma manufacturer solutions offering in the second half of 2023. The year-over-year change 
 was also driven by organic growth as we continued to expand our market penetration with pharma manufacturers and other 
 customers . The prior year quarter included 2.5 million of revenue contribution from vitaCare Prescription Services, Inc., 

18 

Table of Contents 

("vitaCare"), a solution we de-prioritized in connection with our restructuring of pharma manufacturer solutions as described 
 above, compared to nil in the third quarter of 2024. We expect pharma manufacturer solutions to continue to grow as a 
 percentage of total revenue in the near to medium term as we continue to scale and expand available services, capabilities 
 and platforms of our pharma manufacturer solutions offering. 
 Costs and Operating Expenses 
 Cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization 
 Cost of revenue decreased 7.0 million , or 38 , year-over-year, primarily driven by a 6.4 million decrease in 
 outsourced and in-house personnel and other costs related to consumer support due to lower average headcount principally 
 as a result of the restructuring of our pharma manufacturer solutions offering in the second half of 2023. 
 Product development and technology 
 Product development and technology expenses decreased 9.5 million , or 24 , year-over-year, p rimarily driven by a 
 7.6 million loss recognized last year on the disposal of certain capitalized software that were not yet ready for their intended 
 use principally as a result of the restructuring of our pharma manufacturer solutions offering in the second half of 2023. 
 Sales and marketing 
 Sales and marketing expenses decreased 1.7 million , or 2 , year-over-year, primarily driven by a 5.5 million 
 decrease in promotional expenses substantially in the form of consumer discounts. Beginning in December 2023, consumer 
 discounts are recognized as a reduction of revenue as a result of a change in some aspects of our consumer incentives 
 program. The impact from this driver was partially offset by a 2.2 million increase in third-party marketing expenses. For 
 further information regarding our consumer incentives program, see Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements 
 included in our 2023 10-K. 
 General and administrative 
 General and administrative expenses decreased 9.7 million , or 27 , year-over-year, primarily driven by a 4.0 million 
 decrease in stock-based compensation expense related to awards granted to our Co-Founders in 2020 and a net 3.0 
 million estimated legal settlement loss recognized during the third quarter of 2023 with respect to an ongoing class action 
 litigation. 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased 15.5 million , or 47 , year-over-year, primarily driven by 17.5 
 million of amortization recognized last year related to certain intangible assets, which had been accelerated in connection 
 with the restructuring of our pharma manufacturer solutions offering in the second half of 2023. 
 Other Expense 
 We recognized o ther expense of 2.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 related to third-party 
 transaction costs as a result of our debt refinance in July 2024. For additional information, see Note 6 to our condensed 
 consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We recognized other 
 expense of 2.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 related to an impairment loss on one of our minority 
 equity interest investments. 
 Loss on Extinguishment of Debt 
 We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of 2.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 related 
 to the write-off of a portion of existing unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts as a result of our debt refinance in 
 July 2024 . For additional information, see Note 6 to our condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere 
 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income decreased by 3.9 million , or 45 , year-over-year, primarily due to lower average balance of cash 
 equivalents held in U.S. treasury securities money market funds. 

19 

Table of Contents 

Interest Expense 
 Interest expense decreased by 2.4 million , or 16 , year-over-year, primarily due to lower average debt balances, 
 partially offset by higher interest rates. 
 Income Taxes 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 , we had income tax expense of 4.1 million compared to an income 
 tax benefit of 8.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and an effective income tax rate of 51.1 and 
 17.4 , respectively. T he year-over-year change in our income taxes was primarily driven by changes in our income (loss) 
 before income taxes and a higher estimated annual effective income tax rate in 2024, partially offset by net tax benefits from 
 research and development tax credits .

Revenue 
 The year-over-year changes in prescription transactions revenue, subscription revenue and pharma manufacturer 
 solutions revenue were driven by the same factors described above for the three months ended September 30, 2024 
 compared to the same period of 2023 . 
 For subscription revenue, revenue contribution from Kroger Savings decreased 6.3 million year-over-year on a year-to- 
 date basis due to the sunset of the offering. 

20 

Table of Contents 

For prescription transactions revenue, our Monthly Active Consumers increased 8 on a year-to-date basis compared 
 to the same period of 2023 . 
 For pharma manufacturer solutions revenue, revenue contribution from vitaCare w as 7.6 million on a year-to-date 
 basis in 2023 compared to nil for the same period of 2024. For expected revenue trends, see our discussion and analysis 
 above for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 . 
 Costs and Operating Expenses 
 Cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization 
 Cost of revenue decreased 15.7 million , or 30 , year-over-year, primarily driven by a 14.3 million decrease in 
 outsourced and in-house personnel and other costs related to consumer support and a 5.6 million decrease in allocated 
 overhead, both due to lower average headcount principally as a result of the restructuring of our pharma manufacturer 
 solutions offering in the second half of 2023. The impact from these drivers was partially offset by a 3.0 million increase in 
 p rocessin g fees. 
 Product development and technology 
 Product development and technology expenses decreased 11.8 million , or 11 , year-over-year, primarily driven by a 
 7.6 million loss recognized last year on the disposal of certain capitalized software that were not yet ready for their intended 
 use, principally as a result of the restructuring in the second half of 2023, and a 8.3 million decrease in payroll and related 
 costs largely due to higher capitalization of certain qualified costs related to the development of internal-use software . The 
 impact from these drivers was partially offset by a 3.1 million increase in third-party services and contractors associated 
 with product development and allocated overhead. 
 Sales and marketing 
 Sales and marketing expenses increased 25.7 million , or 10 , year-over-year, primarily driven by a 22.0 million 
 increase in payroll and related costs, principally due to higher average headcount and higher stock-based compensation 
 expense due to a reversal of previously recognized stock-based compensation expense recorded in the second quarter of 
 2023 as certain performance milestones were no longer probable of being met in addition to changes in our employee 
 composition. The year-over-year change was also driven by a 15.6 million increase in advertising expenses and a 7.4 
 million increase in third-party marketing expenses. The impact from these drivers was partially offset by a 21.8 million 
 decrease in promotional expenses substantially in the form of consumer discounts, whereas beginning in December 2023 
 these are recognized as a reduction of revenue as described above in the discussion and analysis f or the three months 
 comparison. 
 General and administrative 
 General and administrative expenses decreased 0.8 million , or 1 , year-over-year, primarily driven by a 12.7 million 
 decrease in stock-based compensation expense related to awards granted to our Co-Founders in 2020. The impact from 
 this driver was partially offset by a net 10.0 million increase in estimated legal settlement loss with respect to an ongoing 
 class action litigation and a 3.0 million increase in payroll and related expenses, principally from equity awards granted to 
 our Interim Chief Executive Officer in the second quarter of 2023 and first quarter of 2024. 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased 13.6 million , or 21 , year-over-year, primarily driven by 17.5 
 million of amortization recognized last year related to certain intangible assets, which had been accelerated in connection 
 with the restructuring of our pharma manufacturer solutions offering in the second half of 2023. The impact from this driver 
 was partially offset by higher amortization related to capitalized software in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due 
 to higher capitalization costs for platform improvements and the introduction of new products and features. 
 Other Expense 
 F or other expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , see our discussion and analysis for the three months 
 comparison above . We recognized other expense of 4.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to 
 impairment losses on one of our minority equity interest investments. 

21 

Table of Contents 

Loss on Extinguishment of Debt 
 See our discussion and analysis for the three months comparison above. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income decreased by 5.0 million , or 21 , year-over-year, primarily due to lower average balance of cash 
 equivalents held in U.S. treasury securities money market funds. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense decreased by 0.3 million , or 1 , year-over-year, primarily due to lower average debt balances, 
 partially offset by higher interest rates. 
 Income Taxes 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we had an income tax expense of 10.4 million compared to a 47.9 
 million income tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and an effective income tax rate of 51.9 and 
 155.0 , respectively. The year-over-year change in our income taxes was primarily driven by the release of our valuation 
 allowance against the majority of our net deferred tax assets recorded as a discrete tax benefit in the second quarter of 
 2023, partially offset by a decrease in the tax effects from non-deductible officers stock-based compensation expense and 
 equity awards. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through net cash provided by operating activities, equity 
 issuances, and borrowings under our long-term debt arrangements. Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash 
 equivalents and borrowings available under our 100.0 million secured revolving credit facility. As described in Note 6 to our 
 condensed consolidated financial statements, in July 2024, we extended the maturity date on 88.0 million of our 100.0 
 million revolving credit facility to April 10, 2029, with the remaining 12.0 million maturing on July 11, 2025 . As of 
 September 30, 2024 , we had cash and cash equivalents of 423.8 million and 91.7 million available under our revolving 
 credit facility. 
 As of September 30, 2024 , other than as described in Note 6 to our condensed consolidated financial statements 
 related to the refinancing of our term loan, there were no material changes to our primary short-term and long-term 
 requirements for liquidity and capital or to our contractual commitments as disclosed in Part II, Item 7, "Management's 
 Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of our 2023 10-K. 
 Based on our current conditions, we believe that our net cash provided by operating activities and cash on hand will be 
 adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs for at least the next twelve months from the date of the 
 issuance of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Our future capital requirements will 
 depend on many factors, including the growth of our business, the timing and extent of investments, sales and marketing 
 activities, and many other factors as described in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of our 2023 10-K. 
 If necessary, we may borrow funds under our revolving credit facility to finance our liquidity requirements, subject to 
 customary borrowing conditions. To the extent additional funds are necessary to meet our long-term liquidity needs as we 
 continue to execute our business strategy, we anticipate that they will be obtained through the incurrence of additional 
 indebtedness, additional equity financings or a combination of these potential sources of funds; however, such financing 
 may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funds when or on the terms desired, 
 our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 Holding Company Status 
 GoodRx Holdings, Inc. is a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of its own. As a result, 
 GoodRx Holdings, Inc. is largely dependent upon cash distributions and other transfers from its subsidiaries to meet its 
 obligations and to make future dividend payments, if any. Our debt arrangements contain covenants restricting payments of 
 dividends by our subsidiaries, including GoodRx, Inc., unless certain conditions are met. These covenants provide for 
 certain exceptions for specific types of payments. Based on these restrictions, all of the net assets of GoodRx, Inc. were 
 restricted pursuant to the terms of our debt arrangements as of September 30, 2024 . Since the restricted net assets of 
 GoodRx, Inc. and its subsidiaries exceed 25 of our consolidated net assets, in accordance with Regulation S-X, see Note 
 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2023 10-K for the condensed parent company financial 
 information of GoodRx Holdings, Inc.

Net cash provided by operating activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in 
 assets and liabilities. The 16.7 million year-over-year increase in net cash provided by operations was due to an increase in 
 net income after adjusting for non-cash adjustments , partially offset by an increase of 11.3 million in cash outflow from 
 changes in operating assets and liabilities. Changes in operating assets and liabilities were principally driven by the timing of 
 payments of prepaid services, accounts payable and accrued expenses, income tax payments and refunds, as well as 
 collections of accounts receivable. 
 Net cash used in investing activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities generally consist of cash used for software development costs and capital 
 expenditures, and may also include cash used for acquisitions and investments that we may make from time to time. The 
 10.8 million year-over-year increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by a 10.4 million increase 
 in cash paid for software development. 
 Net cash used in financing activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities primarily consist of principal repayments and debt issuance payments related to 
 our debt arrangements, repurchases of our Class A common stock, and net share settlement of equity awards, partially 
 offset by debt borrowings, and proceeds from exercise of stock options as well as our employee stock purchase plan. The 
 292.2 million year-over-year increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by a 132.5 million 
 increase in payments for repurchases of our Class A common stock, an increase of 161.7 million of net repayments on our 
 term loan as a result of our refinancing in July 2024, and a 9.5 million increase in employee taxes paid related to net share 
 settlement of equity awards. The impact from these drivers was partially offset by a 14.1 million increase in proceeds from 
 exercise of stock options.
