 Contract Balances 
 Contract assets (unbilled receivables) Contract liabilities (deferred revenue) 
 
 The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable, unbilled receivables (contract assets) and customer advances and deposits or deferred revenue (contract liabilities) on the consolidated balance sheet. Generally, billing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition, as a right to payment is not just subject to passage of time, resulting in contract assets, which are generally classified as current. The Company sometimes receives advances or deposits from its customers before revenue is recognized, resulting in contract liabilities. These assets and liabilities are reported on the consolidated balance sheet on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. The contract liability balances at the beginning of each period presented are generally fully recognized in the subsequent period.

 Financing Activities 
 The Company s significant financing arrangements are described in Note 12, Financing Arrangements, in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and, other than as noted below, there have been no material changes to the arrangements described therein. 
 On June 28, 2024, the Company and one of the Company s Canadian subsidiaries (the Canadian Borrower entered into a seventh amended and restated credit agreement (the Amended Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders party to the Amended Credit Agreement. The Amended Credit Agreement amended and restated the sixth amended and restated credit agreement dated October 28, 2020 (the Prior Credit Agreement ). 
 Under the Amended Credit Agreement, the Company has the right to obtain revolving loans and letters of credit for a combined maximum of up to million (with a sub-limit of million for letters of credit) and the Canadian Borrower has the right to obtain revolving loans and letters of credit for a combined maximum of up to million. The maximum borrowing amount of million under the Amended Credit Agreement is increased from million under the Prior Credit Agreement. 
 Borrowings by the Company under the Amended Credit Agreement will bear interest at the Company s option, at either (i) the sum of Term SOFR plus a SOFR Adjustment of plus per annum, or (ii) the U.S. Base Rate, plus per annum, and borrowings by the Canadian Borrower will bear interest, at the Company s option, at either (i) the sum of Term CORRA plus a Term CORRA adjustment of either or for the one or three month interest period respectively, plus per annum, (ii) the Canadian Prime Rate, plus per annum, or (iii) the Canadian Base Rate, plus per annum, as those terms are defined in the Amended Credit Agreement. Other terms under the Amended Credit Agreement are substantially the same as under the Prior Credit Agreement. Subject to certain customary conditions, the facility will expire on June 28, 2029. 
 The Company had outstanding loan balance under the Amended Credit Agreement as of the date of the amendment discussed above, September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had million available to borrow under the revolving credit facility and outstanding letters of credit were million. 
 On March 22, 2024, the Company and substantially all of the Company s domestic subsidiaries entered into Incremental Facility Amendment No. 5 to the Company s existing Credit Agreement, dated as of June 30, 2017 Term Loan Agreement ). Incremental Facility Amendment No. 5 provided for the incurrence of additional term loans (the 2024 Incremental Term Loans under the Term Loan Agreement in the aggregate principal amount of million.

The 2024 Incremental Term Loans are in addition to the aggregate of million of term loans (the Existing Term Loans which were outstanding prior to the issuance of the 2024 Incremental Term Loans. Both the 2024 Incremental Term Loans and the Existing Term Loans (collectively referred to as the 2028 Term Loans will mature on October 8, 2028, and may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty other than customary breakage costs. The Company s obligations under the 2028 Term Loans are guaranteed by substantially all of the Company s domestic restricted subsidiaries and secured by liens on substantially all of the assets of the Company and the guarantors.

 (the one-month Term SOFR adjustment) plus a margin per annum, or (b) the sum of the Base Rate (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement) plus margin per annum. The Term SOFR rate is subject to a floor of and the Base Rate is subject to a floor of . The Company has elected one-month Term SOFR for interest payments on that debt; however, the Term Loan Agreement provides for Term SOFR adjustments for other interest periods. Interest on the 2028 Term Loans is paid monthly with interest payments on the 2024 Incremental Term Loan portion having commenced in April 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the estimated fair value of the Company s outstanding long-term debt, including the current portion, was billion and billion, respectively. The Company s estimates of fair value of its long-term debt, including the current portion, are based on quoted market prices or other available market data which are considered Level 2 measures according to the fair value hierarchy. Level 2 utilizes quoted market prices in markets that are not active, broker or dealer quotation or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency for similar assets and liabilities. 
 As of September 30, 2024, after taking into account the interest rate swaps discussed under the Cash Flow Hedges heading below, the Company s variable rate debt consisted of million of the 2028 Term Loans. The Company s interest rate on this variable rate debt as of September 30, 2024 was . 
 On October 8, 2024, the Company and substantially all of the Company s domestic subsidiaries entered into Amendment No. 6 (the Sixth Amendment to the Term Loan Agreement. The Sixth Amendment (i) eliminated the Term SOFR Adjustment (noted above as per annum) and (ii) resets the six month soft call period for a repricing of the 2028 Term Loans. After giving effect to the repricing, the applicable interest rate margins for the 2028 Term Loans are for Term SOFR borrowings and for base rate borrowings. Under the Sixth Amendment the 2028 Term Loans may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty other than customary breakage costs or if the Company engages in certain repricing transactions before April 8, 2025, in which event a prepayment premium would be due. 
 Cash Flow Hedges 
 The Company s strategy to hedge against fluctuations in variable interest rates involves entering into interest rate derivative agreements. 
 The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of million 2022 Swaps to effectively fix the interest rate on million principal of the outstanding existing Term Loans. The fixed rate on these instruments is and the variable rate is linked to the Term SOFR to mirror the variable interest payments for the Term Loans. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, including the interest rate margin and the SOFR adjustment for the Term Loans, the effective annual interest rate of this million of principal debt was approximately . Following the Sixth Amendment, which eliminated the SOFR adjustment, the effective annual rate on the million of principal is approximately . 
 Prior to the phase-out of LIBOR as a referenced rate on June 30, 2023, the fixed rate on the 2022 Swaps was and the variable rate was linked to LIBOR, to mirror the LIBOR linked variable interest payments for the existing Term Loans. With the then interest rate margin for the existing Term Loans, the effective annual interest rate of the million of principal debt was through June 30, 2023. The 2022 Swaps will expire on September 30, 2027. 
 At the inception of these instruments, the Company designated the 2022 Swaps as cash flow hedges. As of September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a derivative asset with a fair value of million related to the 2022 Swaps. The balance of the derivative asset as of December 31, 2023 was million. These assets are included in Other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets. 
 No ineffectiveness has been identified on the 2022 Swaps and, therefore the change in fair value is recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into interest expense on the unaudited consolidated statement of operations in the same period or periods during which the hedged transactions affect earnings.

 million and million, respectively, for actual or probable liabilities related to the legal and administrative proceedings in which the Company was then involved, the principal of which are described below. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the million and million, respectively, of reserves consisted of (i) million and million, respectively, related to pending legal or administrative proceedings, including Superfund liabilities, which were included in remedial liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, and (ii) million and million, respectively, primarily related to federal, state and provincial enforcement actions, which were included in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets. 
 In management s opinion, it is not reasonably possible that the potential liability beyond what has been recorded, if any, that may result from these actions, either individually or collectively, will have a material effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company periodically adjusts the aggregate amount of these reserves when actual or probable liabilities are paid or otherwise discharged, new claims arise, or additional relevant information about existing or probable claims becomes available. 
 Legal or Administrative Proceedings 
 As of September 30, 2024, the principal legal and administrative proceedings in which the Company was involved, or which had been terminated during 2024, relate to Safety-Kleen product liability cases and Superfund proceedings. 
 Safety-Kleen Product Liability Cases: Safety-Kleen, Inc. Safety-Kleen ), which is a legal entity acquired by the Company in 2012, has been named as a defendant in certain product liability cases that are currently pending in various courts and jurisdictions throughout the United States. As of September 30, 2024, there were approximately proceedings (excluding cases which have been settled but not formally dismissed) wherein persons claim personal injury resulting from the use of Safety-Kleen s parts cleaning equipment or cleaning products. These proceedings typically involve allegations that the solvent used in Safety-Kleen s parts cleaning equipment contains contaminants and/or that Safety-Kleen s recycling process does not effectively remove the contaminants that become entrained in the solvent during their use. In addition, certain claimants assert that Safety-Kleen failed to warn adequately the product user of potential risks, including a historic failure to warn that solvent contains trace amounts of toxic or hazardous substances such as benzene.

 product liability claims were settled or dismissed. Due to the nature of these claims and the related insurance, the Company did not incur any expense as insurance provided coverage in full for all such claims. Safety-Kleen may be named in similar, additional lawsuits in the future, including claims for which insurance coverage may not be available. 
 Superfund Proceedings: The Company has been notified that either the Company or the prior owners of certain facilities the Company has since acquired have been identified as potentially responsible parties PRPs or potential PRPs of indemnification obligations in connection with sites which are subject to or are proposed to become subject to proceedings under federal or state Superfund laws. Of the Superfund related sites, involve facilities that are now owned or leased by the Company and involve third-party sites which received waste potentially shipped by the Company or the prior owners of certain facilities the Company has since acquired. Of the third-party sites, are now settled, are currently requiring expenditures on remediation and are not currently requiring expenditures on remediation. 
 In connection with each site, the Company has estimated the extent, if any, to which it may be subject, either directly or as a result of any indemnification obligations, for cleanup and remediation costs, related legal and consulting costs associated with PRP investigations, settlements and related legal and administrative proceedings. The amount of such actual and potential liability is inherently difficult to estimate because of, among other relevant factors, uncertainties as to the legal liability (if any) of the Company or the prior owners of certain of the Company s facilities to contribute a portion of the cleanup costs, the assumptions that must be made in calculating the estimated cost and timing of remediation, the identification of other PRPs and their respective capability and obligation to contribute to remediation efforts and the existence and legal standing of indemnification agreements (if any) with prior owners, which may either benefit the Company or subject the Company to potential indemnification obligations. The Company believes its potential monetary liability could exceed 1.0 million at of the Superfund related sites. 
 Of the third-party sites at which the Company has been notified it is a PRP or potential PRP or may have indemnification obligations, the Company has indemnification agreements at a total of sites. These agreements indemnify the Company with respect to any liability at the sites for waste disposed prior to the Company s acquisition of the former subsidiaries of Waste Management, Inc. and McKesson Corporation which had shipped waste to those sites. Accordingly, the indemnifying parties are paying all costs of defending those subsidiaries in those cases, including legal fees and settlement costs. However, there can be no guarantee that the Company s ultimate liabilities for those sites will not exceed the amount recorded or that indemnities applicable to any of these sites will be available to pay all or a portion of related costs. Except for those indemnification agreements discussed, the Company does not have an indemnity agreement with respect to any of the third-party sites discussed above. 
 Federal, State and Provincial Enforcement Actions 
 From time to time, the Company pays fines or penalties in regulatory proceedings relating primarily to waste treatment, storage or disposal facilities. As of September 30, 2024, there was proceeding for which the Company believed it was possible that the sanctions could equal or exceed 1.0 million. As of December 31, 2023, there were proceedings for which the Company believed it was possible that the sanctions could equal or exceed 1.0 million. As of the date of these financial statements, the Company believes that the fines or other penalties in this or any of the other regulatory proceedings will, individually or in the aggregate, not have a material effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

 Overview 
 We are North America s leading provider of environmental and industrial services, supporting our customers in finding environmentally responsible solutions to further their sustainability goals in today s world. Everywhere industry meets the environment, we strive to provide eco-friendly products and services that protect and restore North America s natural environment. We believe we operate, in the aggregate, the largest number of hazardous waste incinerators, landfills and treatment, storage and disposal facilities TSDFs in North America. We serve over 300,000 customers, including the majority of Fortune 500 companies, across various markets including chemical and manufacturing, as well as numerous government agencies. These customers rely on us to safely deliver a broad range of services including but not limited to end-to-end hazardous waste management, emergency response, industrial cleaning and maintenance and recycling services. We are also a leading provider of parts cleaning and related environmental services to general manufacturing, automotive and commercial customers in North America and the largest re-refiner and recycler of used oil in North America, offering a unique closed-loop re-refining process that helps customers achieve their sustainability goals. 
 Performance of our segments is evaluated on several factors of which the primary financial measure is Adjusted EBITDA, which is reconciled to our net income and described more fully below. The following is a discussion of how management evaluates its segments using other factors, including key performance indicators that management uses to assess the segments results, as well as certain macroeconomic trends and influences that impact each reportable segment: 
 Environmental Services - Environmental Services segment results are predicated upon the demand by our customers for our wide variety of services, waste volumes managed by delivering such services and project work for which responsible waste handling and/or disposal is required. Environmental Services results are also impacted by the demand for planned and unplanned industrial related cleaning and maintenance services at customer sites, environmental cleanup services on a scheduled or emergency basis, including response to large scale events such as major chemical spills, natural disasters, or other instances where immediate and specialized services are required. The Environmental Services segment results include the Safety-Kleen branches core environmental service offerings of containerized waste disposal, parts washer and vacuum services. These results are driven by the volumes of waste collected from these customers, the overall number of parts washers placed at customer sites and the demand for and frequency of other offered services. The results and integration of the acquired operations of HEPACO Blocker, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively HEPACO also impact the overall segment results. In managing the business and evaluating performance, management tracks the volumes and mix of waste handled and disposed of or recycled, generally through our incinerators, TSDFs and landfills, the utilization rates of our incinerators, equipment and workforce, including billable hours and the number of parts washer services performed, and pricing realized by our business and peer companies as well as other key metrics. Levels of activity and ultimate performance associated with this segment can be impacted by several factors including overall North American GDP, U.S. industrial production, economic conditions in the general manufacturing, chemical and automotive markets, including efforts and economic incentives to increase domestic operations, available capacity at waste disposal outlets, weather conditions, efficiency of our operations, technology, changing regulations, competition, market pricing of our services, costs incurred to deliver our services and the management of our related operating costs.

 Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions - Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions SKSS offers high quality, environmentally responsible recycled base and blended oil products and other automotive and industrial lubricants to fleet customers, distributors, manufacturers of oil products and industrial plants. Segment results are impacted by market pricing, overall market demand and mix of our oil products sales, with management s objective being to limit exposure to commodity market pricing risk through increased production of value added blended lubricants and contracted rate supply agreements with customers. Segment results are also predicated on the demand for other SKSS product and service offerings including collection services for used oil, used oil filters and other automotive fluids. The used oil collected is used as feedstock in our oil re-refining to produce our base and blended oil products and other hydraulic oils, lubricants and recycled fuel oil or are integrated into our recycling and disposal network. The results and integration of the acquired operations of Noble Oil Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively Noble also impact the overall segment results. In operating the business and evaluating performance, management tracks the volumes and relative percentages of base and blended oil sales along with various pricing metrics associated with the commodity driven margin between product pricing and the overall costs to collect used oil. Levels of activity and ultimate performance associated with this segment can be impacted by economic conditions and product demand in the manufacturing and automotive services markets, product pricing, efficiency of our operations, partnerships, technology, weather conditions, changing regulations, competition and the management of our related operating costs. Costs incurred in connection with the collection of used oil and other raw materials associated with the segment s oil related products can also be volatile and can be impacted by global events and their relative impact on commodity products and pricing. The overall market price of oil and regulations that change the possible usage of used oil or burning of used oil as a fuel, impact the premium the segment can charge for used oil collections. 
 Highlights 
 Total direct revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,529.4 million and 4,458.8 million, compared with 1,365.7 million and 4,071.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our Environmental Services segment direct revenues increased 150.8 million and 389.9 million or 13.2 and 11.5 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from the comparable periods in 2023 driven by growth in Field and Emergency Response Services, including the contributions from the acquisition of HEPACO, Technical Services and Safety-Kleen core service offerings. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our SKSS segment direct revenues increased 12.9 million or 5.9 , from the comparable period in 2023, driven by contributions from our acquisition of Noble. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, SKSS segment direct revenues decreased 2.0 million or 0.3 from the comparable period in 2023, due to lower base and blended oil product revenues resulting from market-driven pricing and lower volumes of base oil sold partially offset by contributions from Noble Oil. Foreign currency translation of our Canadian operations negatively impacted our consolidated direct revenues by 2.8 million and 5.3 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 Income from operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 192.3 million and 533.3 million, compared with 154.4 million and 465.1 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing an increase of 24.6 and 14.6 , respectively. Net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 115.2 million and 318.3 million, compared with net income of 91.3 million and 279.5 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing an increase of 26.1 and 13.9 , respectively. 
 Adjusted EBITDA, which is the primary financial measure by which we evaluate our segments, increased 46.8 million or 18.4 from 255.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 301.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. Adjusted EBITDA increased 102.1 million or 13.5 from 757.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 859.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This Adjusted EBITDA growth is primarily driven by contributions from the Environmental Services Segment. Additional information regarding Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure, including a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA, appears below under Adjusted EBITDA. 
 Net cash from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 18.1 million from 455.7 million in 2023 to 473.8 million in 2024. Adjusted free cash flow, which management uses to measure our financial strength and ability to generate cash, decreased 38.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023. The decrease in adjusted free cash flow was driven by higher planned spend on property, plant and equipment including incremental investments in vehicles, machinery and equipment and notable project spend at our Baltimore, Maryland facility and Kimball, Nebraska incinerator and increased working capital balances, partially offset by higher cash flow from operations. Additional information regarding adjusted free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure, including a reconciliation of net cash from operating activities to adjusted free cash flow, appears below under Adjusted Free Cash Flow .

 Environmental Services direct revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 150.8 million from the comparable period in 2023 due to growth across most of our service lines driven by acquisitive growth and incremental revenues from legacy operations. Field and emergency response service revenues increased 105.2 million from the comparable period in 2023 driven by incremental revenue of approximately 75 million from the acquisition of HEPACO as well as contributions from our legacy field services operations. Technical services revenue increased 33.3 million largely due to contributions across our portfolio of waste disposal facilities, including higher incineration pricing and volumes. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, utilization at our incinerators increased from 86 to 89 . Revenues for Safety-Kleen core service offerings grew by 18.6 million from the comparable period in 2023 driven by improved pricing and greater demand for our containerized waste, vacuum and parts washer services. These increases were partially offset by decreased revenues from our industrial services operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which declined 4.7 million due to lower turnaround activity late in the quarter, as compared to the same period in 2023. Direct revenues for Canadian operations of the Environmental Services segment decreased by 2.2 million due to foreign currency translation. 
 Environmental Services direct revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 389.9 million from the comparable period in 2023 due to growth across most of our service lines driven by incremental revenues from legacy operations and acquisitive growth. Field and emergency response service revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 219.1 million from the comparable period in 2023 driven by incremental revenue of approximately 160 million from the acquisition of HEPACO as well as overall growth in core field and emergency response service offerings. Technical services revenue increased 128.0 million largely due to higher incineration pricing and volume coupled with improved pricing at our landfill facilities. Utilization at our incinerators increased from 83 to 85 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. Revenues for Safety-Kleen core service offerings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 grew by 63.1 million from the comparable period in 2023 due to improved pricing and greater demand for our containerized waste, vacuum and parts washer services. Revenue from our industrial services operations declined 21.7 million due to lower turnaround activity and related high-value services for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, partially offset by incremental revenue from the acquisition of Thompson Industrial Services which occurred in March 2023. Direct revenues for Canadian operations of the Environmental Services segment decreased by 4.3 million due to foreign currency translation.

 In the three months ended September 30, 2024, SKSS direct revenues increased 12.9 million from the comparable period in 2023 due to a 16.8 million increase in revenues from the sale of vacuum gas oil and specialty refinery products largely resulting from the acquisition of Noble which took place on March 1, 2024. This increase was partially offset by a 1.8 million decrease in revenues from the collection of used oil despite an increase in the volume collected in the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the used oil collections in the same period of 2023. Revenues from the sale of base and blended oil products were relatively flat due to unfavorable market conditions. 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, SKSS direct revenues decreased 2.0 million from the comparable period in 2023 largely due to a 12.8 million reduction in revenues from base oil sales driven primarily by lower pricing and, to a lesser extent, lower volumes sold. Revenue from contract packaging decreased 8.9 million and revenues generated from the sales of other products decreased 5.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. Revenue from the sales of blended oil products decreased by 2.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared with the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower pricing despite increased volume sold. These decreases were partially offset by a 27.2 million increase in revenues from the sale of vacuum gas oil and specialty refinery products primarily driven by the acquisition of Noble as well as a 2.3 million increase in revenues from the collection of used oil driven by higher volume collected in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the used oil collections in the same period of 2023. 
 Cost of Revenues 
 We believe that management of operating costs is vital to our ability to remain price competitive. We continue to experience inflationary pressures across several cost categories, but most notably related to internal and external labor, transportation, maintenance costs, and energy related costs. We aim to manage these increases through constant cost monitoring and a focus on cost saving areas, including lowering employee turnover, as well as our overall customer pricing strategies designed to offset the inflationary impacts on our margins. 
 We continue to upgrade the quality and efficiency of our services through the development of new technology and continued modifications and expansion at our facilities while also leveraging certain fixed costs of our operating infrastructure. We invest in new business opportunities and aggressively implement strategic sourcing and logistics solutions, while also continuing to optimize our management and operating structure in an effort to manage our operating margins.

 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Management considers Adjusted EBITDA to be a measurement of performance which provides useful information to both management and investors. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income or other measurements under generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus accretion of environmental liabilities, stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, net interest expense, loss on early extinguishment of debt and provision for income taxes and excludes other gains, losses and non-cash charges not deemed representative of fundamental segment results and other expense (income), net. Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies and therefore our measurements of Adjusted EBITDA, while defined consistently with our existing credit agreement, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 
 We use Adjusted EBITDA to enhance our understanding of our operating performance, which represents our views concerning our performance in the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of our operations. We historically have found it helpful, and believe that investors have found it helpful, to consider an operating measure that excludes certain expenses relating to transactions not reflective of our core operations. 
 The information about our operating performance provided by Adjusted EBITDA is used by our management for a variety of purposes. We regularly communicate Adjusted EBITDA results to our lenders since our loan covenants are based upon levels of Adjusted EBITDA achieved and to our board of directors and we discuss with the board our interpretation of such results. We also compare our Adjusted EBITDA performance against internal targets as a key factor in determining cash and equity bonus compensation for executives and other employees, largely because we believe that this measure is indicative of how the fundamental business is performing and being managed. 
 We also provide information relating to our Adjusted EBITDA so that analysts, investors and other interested persons have the same data that we use to assess our core operating performance. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA should be viewed only as a supplement to the GAAP financial information. We also believe, however, that providing this information in addition to, and together with, GAAP financial information provides a better understanding of our core operating performance and how management evaluates and measures our performance.

 Interest expense, net of interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 6.1 million from the comparable period in 2023 due to higher levels of outstanding debt as a result of the 2024 Incremental Term Loans entered into on March 22, 2024. Interest expense was partially offset by a 2.5 million increase in interest income in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the comparable period in 2023. 
 Interest expense, net of interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 20.4 million from the comparable period in 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, interest expense, net of interest income included an 8.3 million benefit recognized from settling interest rate swaps in that prior year period. 
 Absent this benefit, interest expense, net of interest income, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 12.1 million from the comparable period in 2023 due to the 2024 Incremental Term Loans discussed above. Interest expense was partially offset by a 5.4 million increase in interest income in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the comparable period in 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the effective interest rate on our debt was 5.6 . For the remainder of 2024, we expect interest expense to continue to trend higher than the prior year due to higher levels of outstanding debt and a slightly higher weighted average effective interest rate. For additional information regarding the financing events during 2024 and our current portfolio of long-term debt, see Note 11, Financing Arrangements, to the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements.

 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for income taxes increase was consistent with the increase in pre-tax income compared to the prior period. Our effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 remained relatively consistent compared to the prior periods.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. Our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to fund operations, capital expenditures, interest payments and investments in line with our business strategy as of the date of this report. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating and internal investing cash needs. We monitor our actual needs and forecasted cash flows, our liquidity and our capital resources, enabling us to plan our present needs and fund items that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or opportunities. Furthermore, our existing cash balance and the availability of additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility provide additional potential sources of liquidity should they be required. 
 Summary of Cash Flow Activity 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash from operating activities 473,833 455,692 Net cash used in investing activities (812,940) (447,069) Net cash from (used in) financing activities 408,555 (165,322) 
 Net cash from operating activities 
 Net cash from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 473.8 million as compared to 455.7 million in the same period in 2023. This 18.1 million increase in operating cash flows was attributable to an increase in operating income of 68.1 million, lower cash paid for taxes of 6.6 million, and a 4.4 million reduction in environmental expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. These were partially offset by increased working capital balances and an increase in cash paid for interest of 33.4 million. 
 Net cash used in investing activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 812.9 million, an increase of 365.9 million from the comparable period in 2023. Cash used for acquisitions increased 354.4 million as we paid more for the acquisitions of HEPACO and Noble in 2024 than we did for the acquisition of Thompson Industrial in 2023. Additions to property, plant and equipment increased 57.9 million, largely driven by increased investments in vehicles, machinery and equipment for our operations and notable project spend including 15.8 million spent on the Baltimore, Maryland facility. The remaining change in net cash used in investing activities was due to the timing of transactions within our wholly owned captive insurance company which resulted in a 26.3 million cash inflow in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a 19.9 million cash outflow in the nine months ended 2023. 
 Net cash from (used in) financing activities 
 Net cash from financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 408.6 million, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of 165.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary drivers of this change were the incurrence of additional term loans net of discount of 499.4 million in 2024 as compared to a net 121.5 million repayment of debt in 2023. Partially offsetting this activity was an increase in finance lease payments of 12.0 million. 
 Adjusted Free Cash Flow 
 Management considers adjusted free cash flow to be a measure of liquidity which provides useful information to both management, creditors and investors about our financial strength and our ability to generate cash. Additionally, adjusted free cash flow is a metric on which a portion of management incentive compensation is based. We believe that adjusted free cash flow should be viewed only as a supplement to the GAAP financial information. We define adjusted free cash flow as net cash from operating activities excluding cash impacts of items derived from non-operating activities, less additions to property, plant and equipment plus proceeds from sales or disposals of fixed assets. Adjusted free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net cash from operating activities or other measurements under GAAP. Adjusted free cash flow is not calculated identically by all companies, and therefore our measurements of adjusted free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

 The following is a reconciliation of net cash from operating activities to adjusted free cash flow for the following periods (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash from operating activities 473,833 455,692 Additions to property, plant and equipment (369,826) (311,906) Proceeds from sale and disposal of fixed assets 6,353 5,129 Adjusted free cash flow 110,360 148,915 
 Summary of Capital Resources 
 At September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled 594.7 million, compared to 550.8 million at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents held by our Canadian subsidiaries totaled 46.8 million. The cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balance for our U.S. operations was 547.9 million at September 30, 2024. Our U.S. operations had net operating cash inflows of 478.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 We maintain a 600.0 million revolving credit facility of which, as of September 30, 2024, approximately 469.8 million was available to borrow under the facility, with letters of credit of 130.2 million outstanding. 
 Material Capital Requirements 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Capital expenditures during the first nine months of 2024 were 369.8 million as compared to 311.9 million during the first nine months of 2023. The increase was driven by incremental investments in our fleet and equipment and Baltimore, Maryland facility as well as incremental spend on the Kimball incinerator. We anticipate that 2024 capital spending, net of disposals, will be in the range of 400.0 million to 430.0 million. 
 We are nearing the completion of the construction of our new incinerator in Kimball, Nebraska and intend to commence operations in the fourth quarter of 2024. Total spending on the project as of September 30, 2024 was 198.0 million. Capital spending on the strategic project in Baltimore, Maryland for the first nine months of 2024 was 15.8 million for the purchase of the facility and site improvements. 
 We anticipate that the capital spending will be funded by cash from our operations. Unanticipated changes in environmental regulations could require us to make significant capital expenditures for our facilities and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. 
 Financing Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, our financing arrangements include (i) 545.0 million of 4.875 senior unsecured notes due 2027, (ii) 1,468.7 million of senior secured term loans due 2028, (iii) 300.0 million of 5.125 senior unsecured notes due 2029 and (iv) 500.0 million of 6.375 senior unsecured notes due 2031. As noted above, we also maintain our 600.0 million revolving credit facility with no amounts owed as of September 30, 2024. 
 The material terms of these arrangements are discussed further in Note 11, Financing Arrangements, to the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants of all of our debt agreements, and we believe we will continue to meet such covenants. 
 Common Stock Repurchases Pursuant to Publicly Announced Plan 
 The Company s common stock repurchases are made pursuant to the previously authorized board approved plan to repurchase up to 1.1 billion of the Company s common stock. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased and retired 84,910 and 135,572 shares, respectively, of the Company s common stock for total expenditures of 20.0 million and 30.0 million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company repurchased and retired a total of 58,341 and 117,064 shares, respectively, of the Company s common stock for total expenditures of 10.0 million and 18.0 million, respectively. 
 34 

Table of Contents 

 Through September 30, 2024, the Company has repurchased and retired a total of approximately 8.7 million shares of its common stock for 575.9 million under the board approved plan, and as of September 30, 2024, an additional 524.1 million remained available for repurchase of shares. 
 Environmental Liabilities 
 (in thousands, except percentages) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Change Change Closure and post-closure liabilities 119,578 118,600 978 0.8 Remedial liabilities 110,658 111,243 (585) (0.5) Total environmental liabilities 230,236 229,843 393 0.2 
 Total environmental liabilities as of September 30, 2024 were 230.2 million, relatively consistent with the balance as of December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the environmental liability balance increased due to accretion of 10.1 million, new environmental liabilities, including those assumed through acquisition, of 5.9 million and changes in environmental liability estimates of 4.4 million. These increases were partially offset by expenditures of 19.7 million. The liability estimate increase was primarily driven by a 2.9 million increase to the remedial liability reserve for a Superfund site. 
 We anticipate our environmental liabilities, substantially all of which we assumed in connection with our acquisitions, will be payable over many years and that cash flow from operations will generally be sufficient to fund the payment of such liabilities when required. 
 Events not anticipated (such as future changes in environmental laws and regulations) could require that payments to satisfy our environmental liabilities be made earlier or in greater amounts than currently anticipated, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. Conversely, the development of new treatment technologies or other circumstances may arise in the future which may reduce amounts ultimately paid. 
 Letters of Credit 
 We obtain standby letters of credit as security for financial assurances we have been required to provide to regulatory bodies for our hazardous waste facilities and which would be called only in the event that we fail to satisfy closure, post-closure and other obligations under the permits issued by those regulatory bodies for such licensed facilities. As of September 30, 2024, there were 130.2 million outstanding letters of credit. See Note 11, Financing Arrangements, to the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements.

The stock repurchase program authorizes us to purchase our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions periodically in a manner that complies with applicable U.S. securities laws. The number of shares purchased and the timing of the purchases has depended and will depend on several factors, including share price, cash required for business plans, trading volume and other conditions. As part of our share repurchase program, we maintain a repurchase plan in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no shares were repurchased under the Rule 10b5-1 plan. Future repurchases may be made as open market or privately negotiated transactions as described above.
