 Weighted average common shares outstanding 15,052 Effect of dilutive common stock awards Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding Basic earnings per common share Diluted earnings per common share 
 Cumulative quarterly per share performance may not equal annual per share totals due to the effects of the amount and timing of capital increases. When computing earnings per share for an interim period, the denominator is based on the weighted average shares outstanding during the interim period, and not on an annualized weighted average basis. Accordingly, the sum of the earnings per share data for the quarters will not necessarily equal the year to date earnings per share data. 
 million shares and shares, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share as the effect of their exercise would have been anti-dilutive. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, options to purchase approximately million shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share as the effect of their exercise would have been anti-dilutive.

Granted Exercise of stock options ) Forfeited ) Outstanding - September 30, 2024 Exercisable - September 30, 2024 
 The terms of the stock option agreements permit having a number of shares of stock withheld, the fair market value of which as of the date of exercise is sufficient to satisfy the exercise price and/or tax withholding requirements. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, such shares were withheld by the Company. 
 Intrinsic value represents the amount by which the fair market value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the stock options. The intrinsic value of options exercised for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately million and million, respectively. 
 Granted Vested ) Outstanding - September 30, 2024 
 The terms of the restricted stock agreements permit the surrender of shares to the Company upon vesting in order to satisfy applicable withholding at the minimum statutory withholding rate, and accordingly shares were surrendered for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The Company recognized approximately million and million of stock-based compensation expense (included in personnel on the consolidated statements of income) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, associated with its common stock awards granted to officers and employees. In addition, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized approximately million of director expense (included in other expense on the consolidated statements of income) for restricted stock grants totaling shares with immediate vesting to directors, while for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized approximately million of director expense for restricted stock grants totaling shares with immediate vesting to directors, in each case representing the annual stock retainer fee paid to external board members. As of September 30, 2024, there was approximately million of unrecognized compensation cost related to equity award grants, which is expected to be recognized over the remaining vesting period of approximately . The Company recognized a tax benefit of approximately million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, for the tax impact of stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock.

 On March 7, 2023, Nicolet executed the sale of million (par value) U.S. Treasury held to maturity securities for a pre-tax loss of million or an after-tax loss of million. Proceeds from the sale were used to reduce existing FHLB borrowings with the remainder held in investable cash. As a result of the sale of securities previously classified as held to maturity, the remaining unsold portfolio of held to maturity securities, with a book value of million, was reclassified to available for sale with a carrying value of approximately million. The unrealized loss on this portfolio of million (at the time of reclassification) increased the balance of accumulated other comprehensive loss million, net of the deferred tax effect, and is subject to future market changes.

million related to the expected credit loss on a bank subordinated debt investment (acquired in an acquisition), and immediately charged-off the full investment. The Company does not consider its remaining securities AFS with unrealized losses to be attributable to credit-related factors, as the unrealized losses in each category have occurred as a result of changes in noncredit-related factors such as changes in interest rates, market spreads and market conditions subsequent to purchase, not credit deterioration. Furthermore, the Company does not have the intent to sell any of these AFS securities and believes that it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell any such securities before a recovery of cost. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, allowance for credit losses on AFS securities was recognized.

 Other Investments 
 Other investments include restricted equity securities, equity securities with readily determinable fair values, and private company securities. As a member of the Federal Reserve Bank System and the Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB System, Nicolet is required to maintain an investment in the capital stock of these entities. These equity securities are restricted in that they can only be sold back to the respective institutions or another member institution at par. Therefore, they are less liquid than other exchange traded equity securities. As no ready market exists for these stocks, and they have no quoted market value, these investments are carried at cost. Also included are investments in other private companies that do not have quoted market prices, which are carried at cost less impairment charges, if any.

 Accrued interest on loans totaled million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is included in accrued interest receivable and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans : 
 The majority of the Company s loans, commitments, and letters of credit have been granted to customers in the Company s market area. Although the Company has a diversified loan portfolio, the credit risk in the loan portfolio is largely influenced by general economic conditions and trends of the counties and markets in which the debtors operate, and the resulting impact on the operations of borrowers or on the value of underlying collateral, if any.

 , collateral dependent loans, purchased credit deteriorated loans, and other loans with evidence of credit deterioration. The specific reserve in the ACL-Loans for these credit deteriorated loans is equal to the aggregate collateral or discounted cash flow shortfall. Management allocates the ACL-Loans with historical loss rates by loan segment. The loss factors are measured on a quarterly basis and applied to each loan segment based on current loan balances and projected for their expected remaining life. Next, management allocates the ACL-Loans using the qualitative factors mentioned above. Consideration is given to those current qualitative or environmental factors that are likely to cause estimated credit losses as of the evaluation date to differ from the historical loss experience of each loan segment. Lastly, management considers reasonable and supportable forecasts to assess the collectability of future cash flows. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses-Unfunded Commitments : 
 In addition to the ACL-Loans, the Company has established an ACL-Unfunded commitments, classified in accrued interest payable and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. This reserve is maintained at a level that management believes is sufficient to absorb losses arising from unfunded loan commitments, and is determined quarterly based on methodology similar to the methodology for determining the ACL-Loans. The reserve for unfunded commitments was million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Unfunded commitments Investment securities Total 
 Collateral Dependent Loans : 
 A loan is considered to be collateral dependent when, based upon management s assessment, the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. For collateral dependent loans, expected credit losses are based on the estimated fair value of the collateral at the balance sheet date, with consideration for estimated selling costs if satisfaction of the loan depends on the sale of the collateral.

 The loans presented in the table above have had more than insignificant payment delays (which the Company has defined as payment delays in excess of three months). These modified loans are closely monitored by the Company to understand the effectiveness of its modification efforts, and such loans generally remain in nonaccrual status pending a sustained period of performance in accordance with the modified terms. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no loans made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that were modified during the current period and subsequently defaulted, and there were no commitments to lend additional funds to such debtors.

 FHLB Advances : The Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB advance bears a fixed rate, requires interest-only monthly payments, and has a maturity date of March 2025. The weighted average rate of the FHLB advance was at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Junior Subordinated Debentures : Each of the junior subordinated debentures was issued to an underlying statutory trust (the statutory trusts ), which issued trust preferred securities and common securities and used the proceeds from the issuance of the common and the trust preferred securities to purchase the junior subordinated debentures of the Company. The debentures represent the sole asset of the statutory trusts. All of the common securities of the statutory trusts are owned by the Company. The statutory trusts are not included in the consolidated financial statements. The net effect of all the documents entered into with respect to the trust preferred securities is that the Company, through payments on its debentures, is liable for the distributions and other payments required on the trust preferred securities. Interest on all debentures is current. Any applicable discounts (initially recorded to carry an acquired debenture at its then estimated fair value) are being accreted to interest expense over the remaining life of the debenture. All the junior subordinated debentures are currently callable and may be redeemed in part or in full, at par, plus any accrued but unpaid interest. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately million of trust preferred securities qualify as Tier 1 capital. 
 
 Subordinated Notes (the Notes : In July 2021, the Company completed the private placement of million in fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due in 2031, with a fixed annual rate of for the first five years, and will reset quarterly thereafter to the then current three-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus basis points. The Notes due in 2031 are redeemable beginning July 15, 2026 and quarterly thereafter on any interest payment date. The Company repurchased and retired approximately million of these Notes during 2024. 
 In December 2021, as the result of an acquisition, Nicolet assumed million in fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due in 2030, with a fixed annual interest rate of for the first five years, and will reset quarterly thereafter to the then current SOFR plus basis points. The Notes due in 2030 are redeemable beginning June 30, 2025, and quarterly thereafter on any interest payment date. All Notes qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes, and are discounted in accordance with regulations when the debt has five years or less remaining to maturity.

 Financial standby letters of credit Performance standby letters of credit 
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract, and predominantly included commercial lines of credit with a term of one year or less. The commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. 
 Financial and performance standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Financial standby letters of credit are issued specifically to facilitate commerce and typically result in the commitment being drawn on when the underlying transaction is consummated between the customer and the third party, while performance standby letters of credit generally are contingent upon the failure of the customer to perform according to the terms of the underlying contract with the third party. Both of these guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private

million and million, respectively, at September 30, 2024. In comparison, interest rate lock commitments to originate residential mortgage loans held for sale and forward commitments to sell residential mortgage loans held for sale each totaled million at December 31, 2023. The net fair value of these mortgage derivatives combined was a net gain of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Nicolet is party to various pending and threatened claims and legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business activities, some of which may involve claims for substantial amounts. Although Nicolet has developed policies and procedures to minimize legal noncompliance and the impact of claims and other proceedings and endeavored to procure reasonable amounts of insurance coverage, litigation and regulatory actions present an ongoing risk. With respect to all such claims, Nicolet continuously assesses its potential liability based on the allegations and evidence available. If the facts indicate that it is probable that Nicolet will incur a loss and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated, Nicolet will establish an accrual for the probable loss. For matters where a loss is not probable, or the amount of the loss cannot be reasonably estimated, Nicolet does not establish an accrual. 
 Future developments could result in an unfavorable outcome for or resolution of any one or more of the legal proceedings in which Nicolet is a defendant, which may be material to Nicolet s business or consolidated results of operations or financial condition for a particular fiscal period or periods. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of any of these legal proceedings or the range of possible loss, if any, based on the most recent information available, advice of counsel and available insurance coverage, if applicable, management believes that any liability resulting from such proceedings would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. 

Note 9 
 In instances where the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels, the level within which the entire fair value measurement will be categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. This assessment of the significance of an input requires management judgment.

 The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used by the Company for the assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, noted in the tables above. 
 Securities AFS and Equity Securities : Where quoted market prices on securities exchanges are available, the investments are classified as Level 1. Level 1 investments primarily include exchange-traded equity securities. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is generally determined using prices obtained from independent pricing vendors who use pricing models (with typical inputs including benchmark yields, reported trades for similar securities, issuer spreads or relationship to other benchmark quoted securities), or discounted cash flows, and are classified as Level 2. Examples of these investments include U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, obligations of state, county and municipals, and certain corporate debt securities. Finally, in certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to the estimated fair value, investments are classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy. Examples of these include private corporate debt securities, which are primarily trust preferred security investments, as well as certain municipal bonds and mortgage-backed securities. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, it was determined that carrying value was the best approximation of fair value for these Level 3 securities, based primarily on the internal analysis on these securities. 
 Derivatives : The derivative assets and liabilities include mortgage derivatives. The fair value of interest rate lock commitments are determined using the projected sale price of individual loans based on changes in the market interest rates, projected pull-through rates (the probability that an interest rate lock commitment will ultimately result in an originated loan), the reduction in the value of the applicant s option due to the passage of time, and the remaining origination costs to be incurred based on management s estimate of market costs. The fair value of forward commitments are determined using quoted prices of to-be-announced securities in active markets, or benchmarked to such securities. The derivative assets and liabilities are classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy.

 MSR asset (disclosure) December 31, 2023 Collateral dependent loans MSR asset (disclosure) 
 The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used by the Company for the assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, noted in the table above. 
 Collateral dependent loans : For individually evaluated collateral dependent loans, the estimated fair value is based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral with consideration for estimated selling costs if satisfaction of the loan depends on the sale of the collateral, or the estimated liquidity of the note. 
 MSR asset : To estimate the fair value of the MSR asset, the underlying serviced loan pools are stratified by interest rate tranche and term of the loan, and a valuation model is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for each stratum. The servicing valuation model incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income, such as costs to service, a discount rate, ancillary income, default rates and losses, and prepayment speeds. Although some of these assumptions are based on observable market data, other assumptions are based on unobservable estimates of what market participants would use to measure fair value.

Overview 
 The following discussion is management s analysis of Nicolet s consolidated financial condition as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and results of operations for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. It should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements included in Nicolet s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Economic Outlook 
 At the beginning of 2024, there were serious concerns for a recession in 2024, which have since abated. Interest rates shifted higher after the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates 50 bps in mid-September, influenced by a strong employment report and higher than expected Consumer Price Index CPI release. While labor market are cooling, some metrics continue to show strength and the latest employment report was stronger than expected. The CPI for September increased 0.2 , with shelter and food components driving much of this increase, and the CPI is expected to increase 2.6 (annualized) for the second half of 2024. The U.S. election will likely provide additional volatility to the economy over the coming weeks.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We identify tangible book value per common share, return on average tangible common equity, tangible common equity to tangible assets adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per common share as non-GAAP financial measures. In accordance with the SEC s rules, we identify certain financial measures as non-GAAP financial measures if such financial measures exclude or include amounts in the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP in effect in the United States in our statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows. Non-GAAP financial measures do not include operating and other statistical measures, ratios or statistical measures calculated using exclusively financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
 Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures (a) are important metrics used to analyze and evaluate our financial condition and capital strength and provide important supplemental information that contributes to a proper understanding of our operating performance and trends, (b) enables a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business, and (c) allows investors to compare our financial performance to the financial performance of our peers and to evaluate our performance in a manner similar to management, the financial services industry, bank stock analysts, and bank regulators. Management uses non-GAAP measures as follows: in the preparation of our operating budgets, monthly financial performance reporting, and in our presentation to investors of our performance. However, we acknowledge that these non-GAAP financial measures have a number of limitations. Limitations associated with non-GAAP financial measures include the risk that persons might disagree as to the appropriateness of items comprising these measures and that different companies might calculate these measures differently. These disclosures should not be considered an alternative to our GAAP results. A

 (2) Includes the gains / (losses) on other assets and investments, as well as the impact of the March 2023 balance sheet repositioning which included the sale of 500 million (par value) U.S. Treasury held to maturity securities for a pre-tax loss of 38 million or an after-tax loss of 28 million, with the net proceeds used to reduce FHLB borrowings and the remainder held in investable cash. 
 (3) In July 2023, a new Wisconsin tax law change was signed which provided financial institutions with an exemption from state taxable income for interest, fees, and penalties earned on specific loans to existing Wisconsin-based business or agriculture purpose loans. The effective tax rate for periods prior to July 1, 2023, effective date of this tax law change, assumed an effective tax rate of 25 , and periods subsequent to the effective date assumed an effective tax rate of 19.5 . The adjusted net income reconciliation for first and second quarter 2023 is as originally reported, and has not been restated to reflect the 3 million excess tax expense of those quarters that was subsequently reversed in third quarter 2023 due to the Wisconsin tax law change. Thus, the adjusted net income reconciliation for the quarters of 2023 will not sum to the full year impact. 
 
 Performance Summary 
 Net income was 90 million (or earnings per diluted common share of 5.84) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of 31 million (or earnings per diluted common share of 2.05) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, with 2023 significantly impacted by the first quarter balance sheet repositioning (as detailed in Table 1A, Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures above). 
 Net income reflected non-core items and the related tax effect of each, including the first quarter 2023 balance sheet repositioning and third quarter 2023 change in Wisconsin tax law (as detailed in section Non-GAAP Financial Measures above), as well as gains / (losses) on other assets and investments in all periods. These non-core items positively impacted earnings per diluted common share 0.19 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and negatively impacted earnings per diluted common share 2.82 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Net interest income was 197 million for the first nine months of 2024, up 19 million (11 over the first nine months of 2023. Interest income grew 46 million mostly due to the repricing of new and renewed loans in a higher interest rate environment. Interest expense increased 27 million between the comparable nine-month periods also mostly from the higher average funding costs. Net interest margin was 3.35 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.07 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For additional information regarding net interest income, see Income Statement Analysis Net Interest Income. 
 Noninterest income was 61 million for the first nine months of 2024, a 50 million favorable change from the comparable 2023 period, primarily due to the first quarter 2023 balance sheet repositioning (noted above). Excluding net asset gains (losses), noninterest income for the first nine months of 2024 was 58 million, a 7 million increase 
 32 

over the first nine months of 2023. For additional information regarding noninterest income, see Income Statement Analysis Noninterest Income. 
 Noninterest expense was 143 million, 8 million (6 higher than the first nine months of 2023. Personnel costs increased 10 million, while non-personnel expenses combined decreased 2 million (3 from the comparable 2023 period. For additional information regarding noninterest expense, see Income Statement Analysis Noninterest Expense. 
 Nonperforming assets were 26 million, representing 0.31 of total assets at September 30, 2024, compared to 28 million or 0.33 of total assets at December 31, 2023. For additional information regarding nonperforming assets, see Balance Sheet Analysis Nonperforming Assets. 
 At September 30, 2024, assets were 8.6 billion, an increase of 168 million (2 from December 31, 2023, mostly from solid loan growth, partly offset by lower cash balances. For additional balance sheet discussion see Balance Sheet Analysis. 
 At September 30, 2024, loans were 6.6 billion, an increase of 203 million from December 31, 2023, with growth in agricultural, commercial and industrial, and residential real estate loans. On average, loans grew 256 million (4 over the first nine months of 2023. For additional information regarding loans, see Balance Sheet Analysis Loans. 
 Total deposits of 7.3 billion at September 30, 2024, increased 62 million from December 31, 2023, with growth in money market and time deposits, partly offset by lower noninterest-bearing demand deposits from seasonal trends as well as some migration to higher rate deposit products. Year-to-date average deposits were 129 million (2 higher than the first nine months of 2023. For additional information regarding deposits, see Balance Sheet Analysis Deposits. 

INCOME STATEMENT ANALYSIS 
 Net Interest Income 
 Tax-equivalent net interest income is a non-GAAP measure, but is a preferred industry measurement of net interest income (and its use in calculating a net interest margin) as it enhances the comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. The tax-equivalent adjustments bring tax-exempt interest to a level that would yield the same after-tax income by applying the effective Federal corporate tax rates to the underlying assets. Tables 2 and 3 present information to facilitate the review and discussion of selected average balance sheet items, tax-equivalent net interest income, interest rate spread and net interest margin.

 (1) The change in interest due to both rate and volume has been allocated in proportion to the relationship of dollar amount of change in each. 
 (2) The yield on tax-exempt loans and tax-exempt investment securities is computed on a tax-equivalent basis using a federal tax rate of 21 and adjusted for the disallowance of interest expense. 

The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates a total of 425 bps during 2022, increasing the Federal Funds rate to a range of 4.25 to 4.50 as of December 31, 2022. Additional increases totaling 100 bps were made during 2023, resulting in a Federal Funds range of 5.25 to 5.50 as of December 31, 2023, while the Federal Reserve decreased short-term interest rates in September 2024, resulting in a Federal Funds range of 4.75 to 5.00 at September 30, 2024. 
 Tax-equivalent net interest income was 198 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 19 million (11 over the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 19 million increase in tax-equivalent net interest income was mostly attributable to favorable rates (which added 24 million to net interest income), partly offset by unfavorable volumes. 
 Average interest-earning assets increased 61 million to 7.7 billion over the comparable 2023 period, with solid loan growth partly offset by lower investment securities due to the first quarter 2023 balance sheet repositioning (as discussed in further detail under Performance Summary above). Between the comparable nine-month periods, average loans increased 256 million (4 ), on solid organic loan growth. Average investment securities decreased 298 million between the comparable nine-month periods, while other interest-earning assets increased 103 million, with both attributable to the first quarter 2023 balance sheet repositioning. As a result, the mix of average interest-earning assets shifted to 84 loans, 11 investments and 5 other interest-earning assets (mostly cash) for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 81 , 15 and 4 , respectively, for the first nine months of 2023. 
 Average interest-bearing liabilities were 5.6 billion for the first nine months of 2024, an increase of 278 million (5 over the first nine months of 2023. Average interest-bearing core deposits increased 319 million and average brokered deposits increased 140 million between the comparable nine-month periods, reflecting growth in higher cost deposit products and a shift in funding strategy. Wholesale funding decreased 181 million between the comparable nine-month periods, mostly due to the repayment of FHLB borrowings as part of the first quarter 2023 balance sheet repositioning. The mix of average interest-bearing liabilities was 84 core deposits, 14 brokered deposits and 2 wholesale funding for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 82 , 12 , and 6 , respectively, for the first nine months of 2023. 
 The interest rate spread increased 22 bps between the comparable nine-month periods, as the repricing of liabilities has slowed, while new and renewed loans continue to reprice in a higher interest rate environment. The interest-earning asset yield 
 36 

increased 73 bps to 5.58 for the first nine months of 2024, due to the changing mix of interest-earning assets (noted above), as well as the higher interest rate environment. The loan yield improved 62 bps to 5.95 between the comparable nine-month periods, largely due to the repricing of new and renewed loans, while the yield on investment securities increased 73 bps to 2.95 . The cost of funds increased 51 bps to 3.07 for the first nine months of 2024, also reflecting the higher interest rate environment as well as a migration of customer deposits into higher rate deposit products. The contribution from net free funds increased 6 bps, mostly due to the higher value in the current interest rate environment. As a result, the tax-equivalent net interest margin was 3.35 for the first nine months of 2024, a 28 bps increase over 3.07 for the first nine months of 2023. 
 Tax-equivalent interest income was 327 million for the first nine months of 2024, up 46 million from the comparable period of 2023, comprised of 43 million higher average rates and 3 million higher average volume. Interest income on loans increased 42 million over the first nine months of 2023, mostly due to higher rates from the rising interest rate environment, as well as solid loan growth. Interest expense increased to 129 million for the first nine months of 2024, up 27 million compared to the first nine months of 2023, mostly due to a higher cost of funds, as well as growth in deposits. 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 The provision for credit losses was 2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (entirely related to the ACL-Loans), compared to 4.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (comprised of 1.7 million related to the ACL-Loans and 2.3 million for the ACL on securities AFS). The provision for credit losses on loans was attributable to growth and changes in the underlying loan portfolio, while the 2023 provision for credit losses on securities AFS was due to the expected loss on a bank subordinated debt investment which was fully charged-off during first quarter 2023. 
 The provision for credit losses is predominantly a function of Nicolet s methodology and judgment as to qualitative and quantitative factors used to determine the appropriateness of the ACL. The appropriateness of the ACL-Loans is affected by changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio, changes in levels of collateral dependent and other nonperforming loans, historical losses and delinquencies in each portfolio segment, the risk inherent in specific loans, concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries, existing and future economic conditions, the fair value of underlying collateral, and other factors which could affect expected credit losses. The ACL for securities is affected by risk of the underlying issuer, while the ACL for unfunded commitments is affected by many of the same factors as the ACL-Loans, as well as funding assumptions relative to lines of credit. See also Note 5, Loans, Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans, and Credit Quality of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements under Part I, Item 1, for additional disclosures. For additional information regarding asset quality and the ACL-Loans, see BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS Loans, Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans, and Nonperforming Assets.

Noninterest income was 61.4 million for the first nine months of 2024, a favorable change of 49.9 million compared to the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to the 2023 balance sheet repositioning. Noninterest income without net gains (losses) was 57.7 million for the first nine months of 2024, a 7.4 million (15 increase over the comparable period in 2023. 
 Wealth management fee income was 20.2 million, up 2.8 million (16 from the first nine months of 2023, including favorable market-related changes, as well as growth in accounts and assets under management. 
 Mortgage income includes net gains received from the sale of residential real estate loans into the secondary market, capitalized mortgage servicing rights MSR ), servicing fees net of MSR amortization, fair value marks on the mortgage interest rate lock commitments and forward commitments mortgage derivatives ), and MSR valuation changes, if any. Net mortgage income of 6.9 million, increased 1.5 million (29 between the comparable nine-month periods, mostly due to higher secondary market volumes and the related gains on sales, partly offset by changes in the MSR valuation (2023 included a 0.5 million recovery to the MSR valuation while 2024 included a 0.1 million addition to the MSR valuation). See also Note 6, Goodwill and Other Intangibles and Servicing Rights of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements under Part I, Item 1, for additional disclosures on the MSR asset. 
 Services charges on deposit accounts were 5.3 million, up 0.8 million (18 from the first nine months of 2023, on growth in both accounts and account analysis fees. 
 BOLI income was 4.0 million, a 0.7 million (20 increase over the first nine months of 2023, on higher average balances from the 11.5 million new BOLI purchased in mid-2024 and improvements in BOLI assets linked to market performance. 
 The Company sponsors a nonqualified deferred compensation NQDC plan for certain employees that fluctuates based upon market valuations of the underlying plan assets. See also Noninterest Expense for the offsetting fair value change to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan liabilities. 
 Other income of 6.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was up 0.8 million from the comparable 2023 period, largely due to card incentive income. 
 Net asset gains of 3.7 million for the first nine months of 2024 included gains of 1.6 million on sales of investments, a 1.3 million gain on the early extinguishment of Nicolet subordinated notes, and 0.7 million of favorable fair value marks on equity securities. Net asset losses of 38.8 million for the first nine months of 2023 were primarily attributable to losses on the sale of approximately 500 million (par value) U.S. Treasury held to maturity securities as part of a balance sheet repositioning.

Noninterest expense was 143.1 million, an increase of 7.6 million (6 over the first nine months of 2023. Personnel costs increased 9.6 million (13 ), while non-personnel expenses combined decreased 2.0 million (3 compared to the first nine months of 2023. 
 Personnel expense was 81.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 9.6 million from the comparable period in 2023. Salary expense increased 6.8 million (11 over the first nine months of 2023, reflecting merit increases between the years and higher incentives commensurate with current period earnings. Fringe benefits increased 2.8 
 38 

million over the first nine months of 2023, mostly due to higher overall health care expenses. Salary expense was also impacted by the change in the fair value of nonqualified deferred compensation plan liabilities. See also Noninterest Income for the offsetting fair value change to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan assets. 
 Data processing expense was 13.1 million, up 0.2 million (2 between the comparable nine-month periods, mostly due to volume-based increases in core and brokerage processing charges. 
 Intangibles amortization decreased 0.9 million between the comparable nine-month periods due to lower amortization from the aging intangibles. 
 Other expense was 7.6 million, down 0.9 million (11 between the comparable nine-month periods, mostly due to lower professional fees. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 Income tax expense was 22.3 million (effective tax rate of 20.0 for the first nine months of 2024, compared to income tax expense of 18.4 million (effective tax rate of 37.3 for the comparable period of 2023. The change in income tax was mostly due to the lower pretax earnings in 2023, as well as the 9.1 million charge to income tax expense during 2023 to establish a tax valuation allowance related to the Wisconsin tax law change noted above in the Performance Summary section. In addition, the Wisconsin tax law change resulted in a lower effective tax rate beginning in the second half of 2023. 

Income Statement Analysis Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net income was 32.5 million, or adjusted net income (non-GAAP) of 31.6 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of 17.2 million, or adjusted net income (non-GAAP) of 23.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Earnings per diluted common share was 2.10 for third quarter 2024, compared to 1.14 for third quarter 2023. 
 Tax-equivalent net interest income was 68.9 million for third quarter 2024, an increase of 6.9 million from third quarter 2023. Interest income increased 12.7 million over third quarter 2023, while interest expense increased 5.8 million from third quarter 2023. The increase in interest income included 9.7 million from higher yields (reflecting the rising interest rate environment) and 3.0 million from stronger volumes (led by average loans which grew 312 million or 5 over third quarter 2023). Average investment securities decreased 89 million between the comparable third quarter periods, mostly due to investment securities maturities and paydowns, while other interest-earning assets decreased 75 million (primarily investable cash) between the comparable third quarter periods. The 5.8 million increase in interest expense from third quarter 2023, included 3.3 million from higher overall funding costs and 2.6 million from growth in average funding. For additional information regarding average balances, net interest income and net interest margin, see INCOME STATEMENT ANALYSIS Net Interest Income. 
 The net interest margin for third quarter 2024 was 3.44 , compared to 3.16 for third quarter 2023, impacted by the rising interest rate environment and the changing balance sheet mix. The mix of average interest-earning assets shifted from 81 loans, 13 investments and 6 other interest-earning assets (mostly investable cash) for third quarter 2023, to 84 , 11 and 5 , respectively, for third quarter 2024. The mix of average interest-bearing liabilities shifted from 83 core deposits, 12 brokered deposits, and 5 wholesale funding for third quarter 2023, to 83 , 14 , and 3 , respectively, for third quarter 2024, including a continued migration to higher rate deposit products.

 Noninterest income was 22.4 million for third quarter 2024, an increase of 5.8 million (35 from third quarter 2023. Wealth management fee income grew 1.0 million (17 ), including favorable market-related changes, as well as growth in accounts and assets under management. Net mortgage income of 2.9 million, increased 0.8 million (41 between the comparable third quarter periods, mostly due to higher secondary market volumes and the related gains on sales. Services charges on deposit accounts were 1.9 million, up 0.4 million (28 from third quarter 2023, on growth in both accounts and account analysis fees. BOLI income was 1.5 million, a 0.4 million (33 increase over third quarter 2023, on higher average balances from the 11.5 million new BOLI purchased in mid-2024 and improvements in BOLI assets linked to market performance. For additional information regarding noninterest income, see INCOME STATEMENT ANALYSIS Noninterest Income. 
 Noninterest expense was 49.1 million for third quarter 2024, an increase of 3.4 million (7 from third quarter 2023, including a 5.0 million increase in personnel expense and a 1.6 million decrease in non-personnel expenses. The increase in personnel was mostly due to higher salaries, incentives, and fringe benefits. The decrease in non-personnel expenses was 
 39 

mostly due to lower intangible amortization, office expense, and professional fees. For additional information regarding noninterest expense, see INCOME STATEMENT ANALYSIS Noninterest Expense. 
 Income tax expense was 8.3 million (effective tax rate of 20.4 for third quarter 2024, compared to 14.7 million (effective tax rate of 46.1 for third quarter 2023. The change in income tax expense included a 9.1 million charge to income tax expense to establish a valuation allowance, partly offset by a 3.0 million reduction to income tax expense to reverse amounts recorded in the first half of 2023, both related to the Wisconsin tax law change noted above in the Performance Summary section. 

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS 
 At September 30, 2024, period end assets were 8.6 billion, an increase of 168 million (2 from December 31, 2023, mostly from solid growth in loans, partly offset by lower cash balances. Total loans increased 203 million (3 from December 31, 2023, with growth in agricultural, commercial and industrial, and residential real estate loans. Total deposits of 7.3 billion at September 30, 2024, increased 62 million from December 31, 2023, with growth in time and money market deposits partly offset by lower noninterest-bearing demand deposits. Total stockholders equity was 1.1 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 110 million over December 31, 2023, with solid earnings and improvements in the securities portfolio valuation partly offset by the quarterly common stock dividend. 

Loans 
 Nicolet services a diverse customer base primarily throughout Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota. We concentrate on originating loans in our local markets and assisting current loan customers. Nicolet actively utilizes government loan programs such as those provided by the U.S. Small Business Administration SBA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture s Farm Service Agency FSA ). 
 An active credit risk management process is used to ensure that sound and consistent credit decisions are made. The credit management process is regularly reviewed and has been modified over the past several years to further strengthen the controls. Factors that are important to managing overall credit quality are sound loan underwriting and administration, systematic monitoring of existing loans and commitments, effective loan review on an ongoing basis, early problem loan identification and remedial action to minimize losses, an appropriate ACL-Loans, and sound nonaccrual and charge-off policies.

As noted in Table 6 above, the loan portfolio at September 30, 2024, was 76 commercial-based and 24 retail-based. Commercial-based loans are considered to have more inherent risk of default than retail-based loans, in part because of the broader list of factors that could impact a commercial borrower negatively. In addition, the commercial balance per borrower is typically larger than that for retail-based loans, implying higher potential losses on an individual customer basis. Credit risk on commercial-based loans is largely influenced by general economic conditions and the resulting impact on a borrower s operations or on the value of underlying collateral, if any. 
 Total loans of 6.6 billion at September 30, 2024, increased 203 million (3 from December 31, 2023, with growth in agricultural, commercial and industrial, and residential real estate loans. At September 30, 2024, commercial and industrial loans represented the largest segment of Nicolet s loan portfolio at 21 of the total portfolio, followed by agricultural and CRE investment at 19 of the loan portfolio. The loan portfolio is widely diversified and included the following industries: manufacturing, wholesaling, paper, packaging, food production and processing, agriculture, forest products, hospitality, retail, service, and businesses supporting the general building industry. The following chart provides the industry distribution of our commercial loan portfolio at September 30, 2024.

Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans 
 For additional disclosures on the allowance for credit losses, see Note 5, Loans, Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans, and Credit Quality, in the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements under Part I, Item 1. A detailed discussion of the loan portfolio accounting policies, general loan portfolio characteristics, and credit risk are described in Note 1, Nature of Business and Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Credit risks within the loan portfolio are inherently different for each loan type. Credit risk is controlled and monitored through the use of lending standards, a thorough review of potential borrowers, and ongoing review of loan payment performance. Active asset quality administration, including early problem loan identification and timely resolution of problems, aids in the management of credit risk and minimization of loan losses. Loans charged off are subject to continuous review, and specific efforts are taken to achieve maximum recovery of principal, interest, and related expenses. For additional information regarding nonperforming assets see also BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS Nonperforming Assets. 
 The ACL-Loans represents management s estimate of expected credit losses in the Company s loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. To assess the overall appropriateness of the ACL-Loans, management applies an allocation methodology which focuses on evaluation of qualitative and environmental factors, including but not limited to: (i) evaluation of facts and issues related to specific loans; (ii) management s ongoing review and grading of the loan portfolio; (iii) consideration of historical loan loss and delinquency experience on each portfolio segment; (iv) trends in past due and nonaccrual loans; (v) the risk characteristics of the various loan segments; (vi) changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio; (vii) concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries; (viii) existing economic conditions; (ix) the fair value of underlying collateral; and (x) other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect expected credit losses. Assessing these numerous factors involves significant judgment; therefore, management considers the ACL-Loans a critical accounting estimate. 
 Management performs ongoing intensive analysis of the loan portfolio to allow for early identification of customers experiencing financial difficulties, maintains prudent underwriting standards, understands the economy of its markets, and considers the trend of deterioration in loan quality in establishing the level of the ACL-Loans. In addition, various regulatory agencies periodically review the ACL-Loans, and may require the Company to make additions to the ACL-Loans or may require that certain loan balances be charged off or downgraded into classified loan categories when their credit evaluations differ from those of management based on their judgments of collectability from information available to them at the time of their examination. 
 At September 30, 2024, the ACL-Loans was 66 million (representing 1.00 of period end loans), compared to 64 million (or 1.00 of period end loans) at December 31, 2023 and 63 million (or 1.01 of period end loans) at September 30, 2023. The components of the ACL-Loans are detailed further in Table 8 below.

Nonperforming Assets 
 As part of its overall credit risk management process, management is committed to an aggressive problem loan identification philosophy. This philosophy has been implemented through the ongoing monitoring and review of all pools of risk in the loan portfolio to identify problem loans early and minimize the risk of loss. For additional disclosures on credit quality, see Note 5, Loans, Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans, and Credit Quality of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements under Part I, Item 1. For additional information on loans see BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS Loans and for additional information on the ACL-Loans see BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS Allowance for Credit Losses-Loans. 
 Nonperforming loans are considered one indicator of potential future loan losses. Nonperforming loans are defined as nonaccrual loans and loans 90 days or more past due but still accruing interest. Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest or principal payments. Additionally, whenever management becomes aware of facts or circumstances that may adversely impact the collectability of principal or interest on loans, it is management s practice to place such loans on nonaccrual status immediately. Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and other real estate owned OREO ). At September 30, 2024, nonperforming assets were 26 million and represented 0.31 of total assets, compared to 28 million or 0.33 of total assets at December 31, 2023, and 32 million or 0.37 of total assets at September 30, 2023. 
 The level of potential problem loans is another predominant factor in determining the relative level of risk in the loan portfolio and in determining the appropriate level of the ACL-Loans. Potential problem loans are generally defined by management to include loans rated as Substandard by management but that are in performing status; however, there are circumstances present which might adversely affect the ability of the borrower to comply with present repayment terms. The decision of management to include performing loans in potential problem loans does not necessarily mean that Nicolet expects losses to occur, but that management recognizes a higher degree of risk associated with these loans. The loans that have been reported as potential problem loans are predominantly commercial-based loans covering a diverse range of businesses and real estate property types. Potential problem loans were 66 million (1 of loans) and 68 million (1 of loans) at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Potential problem loans require heightened management review given the pace at which a credit may deteriorate, the potential duration of asset quality stress, and uncertainty around the magnitude and scope of economic stress that may be felt by Nicolet s customers and on underlying real estate values.

Deposits 
 Deposits represent Nicolet s largest source of funds, and provide a stable, lower-cost funding source. Deposit levels may be impacted by competition with other bank and nonbank institutions, as well as with a number of non-deposit investment alternatives available to depositors. Deposit challenges include competitive deposit product features, price changes on deposit products given movements in the interest rate environment and other competitive pricing pressures, and customer preferences regarding higher rate deposit products or non-deposit investment alternatives. 
 Total deposits of 7.3 billion at September 30, 2024, increased 62 million from December 31, 2023, with growth in money market and time deposits, partly offset by lower noninterest-bearing demand deposits from seasonal trends as well as some migration to higher rate deposit products. Core deposit balances of 6.6 billion at September 30, 2024, decreased 32 million from December 31, 2023, while brokered deposits increased 94 million. Compared to September 30, 2023, total deposits increased 78 million, the net of a 106 million increase in brokered deposits and a 28 million decrease in core deposits. The deposit composition is presented in Table 10 below.

Liquidity Management 
 Liquidity management refers to the ability to ensure that adequate liquid funds are available to meet the current and future cash flow obligations arising in the daily operations of the Company. These cash flow obligations include the ability to meet the commitments to borrowers for extensions of credit, accommodate deposit cycles and trends, fund capital expenditures, pay dividends to stockholders (if any), and satisfy other operating expenses. The Company s most liquid assets are cash and due from banks and interest-earning deposits, which totaled 428 million and 491 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Balances of these liquid assets are dependent on our operating, investing, and financing activities during any given period. 
 The 63 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents since year-end 2023 included 100 million net cash provided by operating activities and 54 million net cash provided by financing activities (mostly higher deposit balances), partly offset by 218 million net cash used in investing activities (mostly to fund loan growth). As of September 30, 2024, management believed that adequate liquidity existed to meet all projected cash flow obligations. 
 Nicolet s primary sources of funds include the core deposit base, repayment and maturity of loans, investment securities calls, maturities, and sales, and procurement of brokered deposits or other wholesale funding. At September 30, 2024, approximately 39 of the investment securities portfolio was pledged as collateral to secure public deposits and borrowings, as applicable, and for liquidity or other purposes as required by regulation. Liquidity sources available to the Company at September 30, 2024, are presented in Table 11 below.

 Management is committed to the Parent Company being a source of strength to the Bank and its other subsidiaries, and therefore, regularly evaluates capital and liquidity positions of the Parent Company in light of current and projected needs, growth or strategies. The Parent Company uses cash for normal expenses, dividend payments, debt service requirements, and, when opportune, for common stock repurchases, repayment of debt, or investment in other strategic actions such as mergers or acquisitions. At September 30, 2024, the Parent Company had 155 million in cash. Additional cash sources available to the Parent Company include access to the public or private markets to issue new equity, subordinated notes or other debt. Dividends from the Bank and, to a lesser extent, stock option exercises, represent significant sources of cash flows for the Parent Company. The Bank is required by federal law to obtain prior approval of the OCC for payments of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank in any year will exceed certain thresholds. Management does not believe that regulatory restrictions on dividends from the Bank will adversely affect its ability to meet its cash obligations. 

Interest Rate Sensitivity Management and Impact of Inflation 
 A reasonable balance between interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and maintenance of yield, is highly important to Nicolet s business success and profitability. As an ongoing part of our financial strategy and risk management, we attempt to understand and manage the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on our net interest income. The consolidated balance sheet consists mainly of interest-earning assets (loans, investments and cash) which are primarily funded by interest-bearing liabilities (deposits and other borrowings). Such financial instruments have varying levels of sensitivity to changes in market rates of interest. Market rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including but not limited to general economic conditions and policies of governmental and regulatory authorities. Our operating income and net income depends, to a substantial extent, on rate spread (i.e., the difference between the income earned on loans, investments and other earning assets and the interest expense paid to obtain deposits and other funding liabilities). 
 Asset-liability management policies establish guidelines for acceptable limits on the sensitivity to changes in interest rates on earnings and market value of assets and liabilities. Such policies are set and monitored by management and the Board of Directors Asset and Liability Committee. 
 To understand and manage the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income, we measure our overall interest rate sensitivity through a net interest income analysis, which calculates the change in net interest income in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates under different scenarios versus a baseline scenario. Such scenarios can involve static balance sheets, balance sheets with projected growth, parallel (or non-parallel) yield curve slope changes, immediate or gradual changes in market interest rates, and one-year or longer time horizons. The simulation modeling uses assumptions involving market spreads, prepayments of rate-sensitive instruments, renewal rates on maturing or new loans, deposit retention rates, and other assumptions. 
 Among other scenarios, we assessed the impact on net interest income in the event of a gradual +/-100 bps and +/-200 bps change in market rates (parallel to the change in prime rate) over a one-year time horizon to a static (flat) balance sheet. The results provided include the liquidity measures mentioned above and reflect the current interest rate environment. The interest rate scenarios are used for analytical purposes only and do not necessarily represent management s view of future market interest rate movements. Based on financial data at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the projected changes in net interest income over a one-year time horizon, versus the baseline, are presented in Table 12 below. The results are in compliance with Nicolet s policy guidelines. 
 46 

Table 12: Interest Rate Sensitivity 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 200 bps decrease in interest rates (1.1) (1.1) 100 bps decrease in interest rates (0.6) (0.6) 100 bps increase in interest rates 0.6 0.6 200 bps increase in interest rates 1.2 1.2 
 Actual results may differ from these simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, as well as changes in market conditions and their impact on customer behavior and management strategies. 
 The effect of inflation on a financial institution differs significantly from the effect on an industrial company. While a financial institution s operating expenses, particularly salary and employee benefits, are affected by general inflation, the asset and liability structure of a financial institution consists largely of monetary items. Monetary items, such as cash, investments, loans, deposits and other borrowings, are those assets and liabilities which are or will be converted into a fixed number of dollars regardless of changes in prices. As a result, changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than does general inflation. Inflation may also have impacts on the Bank s customers, on businesses and consumers and their ability or willingness to invest, save or spend, and perhaps on their ability to repay loans. As such, there would likely be impacts on the general appetite for banking products and the credit health of the Bank s customer base. 

Capital 
 Management regularly reviews the adequacy of its capital to ensure that sufficient capital is available for current and future needs and is in compliance with regulatory guidelines. The capital position and strategies are actively reviewed in light of perceived business risks associated with current and prospective earning levels, liquidity, asset quality, economic conditions in the markets served, and level of returns available to shareholders. Management intends to maintain an optimal capital and leverage mix for growth and shareholder return. For details on the change in capital see BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS. 
 The Company s and the Bank s regulatory capital ratios remain above minimum regulatory ratios, including the capital conservation buffer. At September 30, 2024, the Bank s regulatory capital ratios qualify the Bank as well-capitalized under the prompt-corrective action framework. This strong base of capital has allowed Nicolet to be opportunistic in strategic growth. A summary of the Company s and the Bank s regulatory capital amounts and ratios, as well as selected capital metrics are presented in the following table.

In managing capital for optimal return, we evaluate capital sources and uses, pricing and availability of our stock in the market, and alternative uses of capital (such as the level of organic growth or acquisition opportunities, dividends, or repayment of equity-equivalent debt) in light of strategic plans. Through an ongoing repurchase program, the Board has authorized the repurchase of Nicolet s common stock as an alternative use of capital. At September 30, 2024, there remained 46 million authorized under this repurchase program, as modified, to be utilized from time-to-time to repurchase shares in the open market, through block transactions or in private transactions. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions or judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, current information, and other factors deemed to be relevant; accordingly, as this information changes, actual results could differ from those estimates. Nicolet considers accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on the financial statements. The accounting estimates we consider to be critical include business combinations and the valuation of loans acquired, the determination of the allowance for credit losses, and income taxes. A discussion of these estimates can be found in the Critical Accounting Estimates section in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no changes in the Company s determination of critical accounting policies and estimates since December 31, 2023. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 There have been no material changes in our market risk at September 30, 2024, from that presented in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. See section Interest Rate Sensitivity Management and Impact of Inflation within Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part I, Item 2, for our interest rate sensitivity position at September 30, 2024.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 (a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures . Management, under the supervision, and with the participation, of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)). Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting . There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) during the quarter covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

 a. During third quarter 2024, the Company withheld 3,491 common shares for minimum tax withholding settlements on restricted stock, and 1,811 common shares were withheld to satisfy the exercise price and tax withholding requirements on stock option exercises. These are not considered repurchases and, therefore, do not count against the maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased under the Board of Directors authorization. 
 b. The Board of Directors approved a common stock repurchase program which authorized, with subsequent modifications, the use of up to 276 million to repurchase outstanding shares of common stock. This common stock repurchase program was last modified on April 19, 2022, and has no expiration date. There were no common stock repurchases under this program during third quarter 2024. At September 30, 2024, approximately 46 million remained available under this common stock repurchase program, or approximately 481,000 shares of common stock (based upon the closing stock price of 95.63 on September 30, 2024).
