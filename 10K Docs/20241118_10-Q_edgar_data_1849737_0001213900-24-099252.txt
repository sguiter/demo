million, the Company was no longer in compliance with the Nasdaq
Global Market continued listing criteria set forth in Listing Rule 5452(b)(C), which requires the Company to maintain an aggregate market
value of its outstanding warrants of at least million. 

On November 7, 2024, the Company received a further
written notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq indicating that the Company s warrants and units would be subject
to suspension and delisting from The Nasdaq Global Market at the opening of business on November 18, 2024 due to the Company s non-compliance
with: (i) in relation to the warrants, Nasdaq Listing Rule 5452(b)(C), which requires the Company to maintain an aggregate market value
of its outstanding warrants of at least million; and (ii) in relation to the units, Nasdaq Listing Rule 5225(a)(1)(A), which requires
that all components of the unit comply with the requirements for continued listing. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had not
commenced any operations. All activities for the period from February 25, 2021 (inception), through September 30, 2024, relates to the
Company s formation, and the initial public offering IPO described below, and post-IPO expenses. The Company will
not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of a Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating
income in the form of realized and unrealized gains on investments from the proceeds derived from the IPO. 

On March 14, 2022, the Company consummated its
IPO of units (the Units ), including the issuance of Units as a result of the underwriters exercise
in full of the over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of Class A ordinary share of the Company, par value per share (the
 Class A Ordinary Shares ), and one-half of redeemable warrant of the Company (each whole warrant, a Public Warrant ),
with each Public Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase Class A Ordinary Share for per share, subject to adjustment.
The Units were sold at a price of per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of . 

The Company s sponsor is Patria SPAC LLC,
a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership (the Sponsor ). Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO and pursuant to
the private placement warrants purchase agreement, the Company completed the private sale of warrants (the Private Placement
Warrants and together with the Public Warrants, the Warrants to the Sponsor at a purchase price of per Private
Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of . 

Transaction costs amounted to , including
 in deferred underwriting fees payable, in underwriting fees paid and in other offering costs, of which
 were expensed and charged to temporary equity. 

Following the closing of the IPO on March 14,
2022, an amount of per Unit) of the proceeds from the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, comprised
of of the proceeds from the IPO (which is net of of the underwriters fees) and of the proceeds
of the sale of Private Placement Warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account (the Trust Account at J.P. Morgan Chase
Bank, N.A. maintained by Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company, acting as trustee. The funds in the Trust Account were invested
only in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act 1940, as amended (the
 Investment Company Act ), having a maturity of days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under
Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Except with respect
to earnings on the funds held in the Trust Account after the redemption that may be released to the Company to pay its taxes, if any,
the proceeds from the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants held in the Trust Account will not be released from the Trust
Account until the earliest of: (i) the completion of the Initial Business Combination; (ii) the redemption of the Class A Ordinary Shares
included in the Units (the Public Shares if the Company is unable to complete the Initial Business Combination by 27 months
after the closing of our IPO on March 14, 2022 (the Combination Period or (iii) the redemption of the Public Shares properly
submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to amend the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association
to (A) modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to allow redemption in connection with the Initial Business Combination
or to redeem of the Public Shares if the Company has not consummated the Initial Business Combination within the Combination Period
or (B) with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders rights or pre-Initial Business Combination activity.
The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could become subject to the claims of the Company s creditors, if any, which could have
priority over the claims of the Company s public shareholders. The remaining proceeds outside the Trust Account may be used to pay
for business, legal and accounting due diligence on prospective acquisitions and continuing general and administrative expenses.

of the Company s Class A ordinary shares
exercised their right to redeem their shares on June 14, 2023. Following such redemptions, Class A ordinary shares remained
outstanding and subject to redemption and the Trust Account had a remainder balance of million immediately following the withdrawal
for Class A ordinary shares redemption. 

Second Extension 

On June 12, 2024, the Company held an
extraordinary general meeting of the Company s shareholders (the Extraordinary General Meeting ). At the
Extraordinary General Meeting, the Company s shareholders approved the Extension Amendment Proposal to amend, by way of
special resolution, the Company s Articles, as set forth in the Trust Agreement dated as of March 9, 2022 by and between the
Company and the Trustee, to extend the Termination Date by which the Company has to consummate a Business Combination from June 14,
2024 (the date which is 27 months from the closing date of the Company s IPO) on a monthly basis for up to fifteen times by an
additional one month each time up to September 14, 2025 (the date which is 42 months from the closing date of the Company s
IPO), unless the closing of a Business Combination shall have occurred prior thereto or such earlier date as determined by the
Board, for a deposit, for each monthly extension, of the lesser of (i) and (ii) for each Class A ordinary share then
outstanding. In connection with the Extraordinary General Meeting, shareholders holding an aggregate of of the
Company s Class A ordinary shares exercised their right to redeem their shares at approximately per share or
 . Following such redemptions, Class A ordinary shares remain outstanding and subject to redemption and the
Trust Account had a remainder balance of approximately million immediately following the withdrawal for Class A ordinary shares
redemptions. As of September 30, 2024, we had deposited into the Trust Account in connection with the second
extension, which extends the termination date to October 14, 2024. Following September 30, 2024, we made additional deposits totaling to extend the termination date to December 14, 2024. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
the Company had deposited and respectively, in connection with these extensions into the Trust Account. These amounts
are included in the balances of marketable securities held in Trust Accounts, promissory note related party, and due to related
party on the Company s unaudited condensed balance sheets. 

7 

of the net assets held in the Trust Account (as defined below) (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting commission
held in Trust and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial Business
Combination. However, the Company only intends to complete a Business Combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires
 or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient
for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act 1940, as amended (the Investment
Company Act ). Upon the closing of the IPO, management has agreed that an amount equal to at least per Unit sold in the IPO,
including the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, was held in a Trust Account located in the United States with
Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company acting as trustee, and invested only in United States government securities 
within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of days or less or in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations,
as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust
Account as described below. The Company provides the holders (the Public Shareholders of the Company s issued and
outstanding Class A Ordinary Shares, par value per share, sold in the IPO (the Public Shares with the opportunity
to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder
meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek
shareholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the
amount then held in the Trust Account. The per-share amount to be distributed to Public Shareholders who redeem their Public Shares will
not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriters. If the Company seeks shareholder approval,
the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination.
If a shareholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons,
the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Articles of Association (the Articles of Association ), conduct the
redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and file tender offer
documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by
law, or the Company decides to obtain shareholder approval for business or legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem the Public
Shares then outstanding in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules.
Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed
transaction. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the initial shareholders (as defined
below) have agreed to vote their Founder Shares (as defined below) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the IPO in favor of
a Business Combination. In addition, the initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder
Shares and Public Shares in connection with the completion of a Business Combination. 

The Articles of Association provides that a Public
Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as
a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )),
will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of of the Public Shares, without the prior consent
of the Company. The holders of the Founder Shares (the initial shareholders have agreed not to propose an amendment to
the Articles of Association (A) to modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to allow redemption in connection
with a Business Combination or to redeem of the Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the
Combination Period (as defined below) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders rights or pre-initial
Business Combination activity, unless the Company provides the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares
in conjunction with any such amendment. 

If the Company is unable to complete a Business
Combination within the Combination Period and the Company s shareholders have not amended the Articles of Association to extend
such Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably
possible but no more than ten business days thereafter subject to lawfully available funds therefor, redeem the Public Shares then outstanding,
at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on
the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its taxes, if any (less up to of interest
to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish
Public Shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject
to applicable law; and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders
and the board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Cayman law to provide
for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.

. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company
if and to the extent any claims by a third party (except for the Company s independent registered public accounting firm) for services
rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction
agreement (a Target ), reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (i) per unit or (ii) the lesser amount
per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the
trust assets, in each case net of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims
by a third party or Target that executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account nor will it apply to any claims
under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against
a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to
reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all
vendors, service providers (other than the Company s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses
or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim
of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. 

Going Concern 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had working
capital of . The working capital surplus includes the amount of restricted marketable securities held in the Trust Account,
deferred underwriting fees payable and derivative warrant liabilities, all of which have been classified as current at September 30, 2024.
The Company s ability to continue operations through the liquidation date is contingent on the payment of the monthly extension
deposit. Working capital deficit would be ) if the line items described above were not included in the working capital calculation.
Cash of was held outside of the Trust Account and is available for the Company s working capital purposes as of September
30, 2024. 

The Company anticipates that the cash held outside
of the Trust Account as of September 30, 2024 will not be sufficient to allow the Company to operate for at least the next 12 months from
the issuance of these unaudited condensed financial statements, assuming that a Business Combination is not consummated during that time.
Over this time period, the Company will be using the funds held outside of the Trust Account for paying existing accounts payable and
accrued liabilities, identifying and evaluating prospective initial Business Combination candidates, performing due diligence on prospective
target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to merge with or acquire, and structuring, negotiating
and consummating the Business Combination. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a
going concern for a period of time within after the date that the unaudited condensed financial statements are issued. Management
plans to address this uncertainty through consummating a business combination. In addition, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor,
or certain of the Company s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required under

shares subject to possible redemption to their redemption amount (i.e., per share) immediately as if the end of the first reporting
period after the IPO, March 14, 2022, was the redemption date. Such changes are reflected in additional paid-in capital, or in the absence

The Company had granted the Underwriters in the
IPO (the Underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to additional Units to cover over-allotments, which was
exercised in full on the IPO date. 

On June 12, 2023, Class A ordinary shares

such redemptions, ordinary shares remained outstanding, consisting of Class A ordinary shares and Class

A Ordinary Shares at a price of per share. The proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants were added to the net proceeds
from the IPO held in the Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the proceeds
from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirements
of applicable law) and the Private Placement Warrants will expire worthless. Upon the purchase of the Private Placement Warrants by the
Sponsor, the Company recorded the excess proceeds received over the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants as additional paid-in

to cover certain of our offering costs, in exchange for an aggregate of Class B ordinary shares (the Founder Shares ),
which were temporarily issued to such officer until such shares were transferred to our sponsor in April 2021. Our Sponsor was formed
on March 9, 2021. In February 2022, our Sponsor forfeited Founder Shares for no consideration, remaining with Founder
Shares. Prior to the IPO, on March 9, 2022, our Sponsor transferred of our Founder Shares to each of our three independent directors.
These shares were not subject to forfeiture. The allocation of the Founder Shares to the directors is in the scope of ASC 718.
Under ASC 718, share-based compensation associated with equity-classified awards is measured at fair value upon the grant date. The Company
used the Monte Carlo model to estimate the fair value associated with the Founder Shares granted. The fair value of the shares
granted to the Company s directors in March 2022 was or per share. The Founder Shares were granted subject to a performance
condition, the occurrence of an Initial Business Combination. Compensation expense related to the Founder Shares is recognized only when
the performance condition is probable of occurrence under ASC 718. The Company determined the performance conditions are not considered
probable, and, therefore, share-based compensation expense was recognized as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As of September
30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the unrecognized stock compensation expense was . 

On March 14, 2022, the underwriters fully exercised
the over-allotment option; thus, the Founder Shares are no longer subject to forfeiture. 

The Sponsor has agreed not to transfer, assign
or sell any of their founder shares and any Class A Ordinary Shares issued upon conversion thereof until the earlier to occur of (A) one
year after the completion of our initial business combination; or (B) subsequent to our initial business combination, (x) if the last
reported sale price of the Class A Ordinary Shares equals or exceeds per share (as adjusted for share sub-divisions, share capitalizations,
reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days
after our initial business combination, or (y) the date following the completion of our initial business combination on which we complete
a liquidation, merger, amalgamation, stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of our public shareholders
having the right to exchange their Class A Ordinary Shares for cash, securities or other property. 

The Founder Shares will convert concurrently with
or immediately following the consummation of our initial business combination at the option of the holders thereof or at any earlier date
at the option of the holders thereof (where such holders have waived any right to receive funds from the trust account) on a one-for-one
basis, subject to adjustment for share sub-divisions, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like, and subject
to further adjustment as provided herein. In the case that additional Class A Ordinary Shares or equity-linked securities are issued or
deemed issued in connection with the Company s Initial Business Combination, the number of Class A Ordinary Shares issuable upon
conversion of all Founder Shares will equal, in the aggregate, of the total number of Class A Ordinary Shares outstanding after such
conversion (after giving effect to any redemptions of Class A Ordinary Shares by Public Shareholders), including the total number of Class
A Ordinary Shares issued, or deemed issued or issuable upon conversion or exercise of any equity-linked securities or rights issued or
deemed issued, by the Company in connection with or in relation to the consummation of the Initial Business Combination, excluding any
Class A Ordinary Shares or equity-linked securities exercisable for or convertible into Class A Ordinary Shares issued, or to be issued,
to any seller in the Initial Business Combination and any Private Placement Warrants issued to the Sponsor, or the Company s officers
or directors upon conversion of Working Capital Loans; provided that such conversion of Founder Shares will never occur on a less than
one-for-one basis.

Administrative Services Agreement 

Following our IPO, the Company pays the Sponsor
or an affiliate a monthly fee of for office space, utilities, secretarial and administrative services. In August 2023, the Company
and its Sponsor executed an agreement to discontinue the remittance of administrative fees to the Sponsor with an effective date of August

Working Capital Loans 

In order to finance transaction costs in connection
with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company s officers and directors may,
but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required Working Capital Loans ). If the Company completes a
Business Combination, the Company would repay the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to the Company.
Otherwise, the Working Capital Loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that a Business Combination
does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds
held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. The Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation
of a Business Combination or, at the lender s discretion, up to of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into
warrants of the post Business Combination entity at a price of per warrant. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement
Warrants. Except for the foregoing, the terms of such Working Capital Loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements
exist with respect to such loans. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no borrowings under the Working Capital
Loans.

option from the date of the IPO to purchase up to an additional Units to cover over-allotments. The underwriters fully exercised
the over-allotment option concurrently with the close of the IPO. The underwriters were entitled to a cash underwriting discount of 
per Unit (or of the gross proceeds of the IPO. Additionally, the underwriters would be entitled to a deferred underwriting
commission of per Unit (or of the gross proceeds of the IPO upon the completion of the Company s Initial Business
Combination. The deferred underwriting commissions would become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account
solely in the event that the Company completes an Initial Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. 

On December 4, 2023, the Company received an executed
deferred underwriting fees waiver letter from J.P. Morgan Securities LLC., one of the Company s underwriters, informing the Company
of its decision to waive any entitlement it may have to its deferred underwriting fees payable held in the Trust Account in respect of
any Business Combination. The waiver does not cover deferred underwriting fees payable to Citigroup Global Market Inc. (representing 
of the total deferred underwriting fees payable). 

Warrants
issued in connection with the IPO (the of Public Warrants and the of Private Placement Warrants) in accordance with
the guidance contained in ASC 815-40. Such guidance provides that because the Warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment thereunder,
each Warrant much be recorded as a liability. Accordingly, the Company classifies each Warrant as a liability at its fair value. This
liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date. With each such remeasurement, the warrant liability will be adjusted
to fair value, with the change in fair value recognized in the Company s statements of operations. 

Each whole Warrant entitles the holder thereof
to purchase Class A Ordinary Share at a price of per share, subject to adjustment. Only whole Warrants are exercisable. The
Warrants will become exercisable days after the completion of the Initial Business Combination and will expire after the
completion of the Initial Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. 

Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole
number of shares. No fractional Public Warrants issued upon separation of the Units and only whole Public Warrants will trade. The Public
Warrants will become exercisable days after the completion of an Initial Business Combination provided that the Company has an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act covering the Class A Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants and
a current prospectus relating to them is available and such shares are registered, qualified or exempt from registration under the securities,
or blue sky, laws of the state of residence of the holder (or holders are permitted to exercise their Public Warrants on a cashless basis
under certain circumstances as a result of (i) the Company s failure to have an effective registration statement by the 60 th 
business day after the closing of the Initial Business Combination or (ii) a notice of redemption described under Redemption
of Warrants when the price per Class A Ordinary Share equals or exceeds ). The Company has agreed that as soon as practicable,
but in no event later than business days after the closing of its Initial Business Combination, the Company will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to file with the SEC a post-effective amendment to the registration statement for the IPO or a new registration statement
covering the Class A Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the same to become effective within business days after the closing of the Company s Initial Business Combination and to maintain
a current prospectus relating to those Class A Ordinary Shares until the Warrants expire or are redeemed. If the shares issuable upon
exercise of the Public Warrants are not registered under the Securities Act in accordance with the above requirements, the Company will
be required to permit holders to exercise their Public Warrants on a cashless basis. However, no Warrant will be exercisable for cash
or on a cashless basis, and the Company will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their Warrants, unless
the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder,
or an exemption from registration is available. Notwithstanding the above, if the Company s Class A Ordinary Shares are at the time
of any exercise of a Public Warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of a covered
security under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, the Company may, at its option, require holders of Public Warrants who exercise
their Public Warrants to do so on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the
event the Company so elects, it will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, and in the event the Company
does not so elect, it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to

raising purposes in connection with the closing of the Initial Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less
than per Class A Ordinary Share (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the board of directors
and, in the case of any such issuance to the Sponsor or its affiliates, without taking into account any Founder Shares held by the Sponsor
or such affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance) (the Newly Issued Price ), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from
such issuances represent more than of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of the Initial Business
Combination on the date of the consummation of the Initial Business Combination (net of redemptions) and (z) the volume weighted average
trading price of Class A Ordinary Shares during the trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which the Company
consummates the Initial Business Combination (such price, the Market Value is below per share, the exercise price

and the and per share redemption trigger prices described under Redemption of Warrants when the price per Class
A Ordinary Share equals or exceeds and Redemption of Warrants when the price per Class A Ordinary Share equals
or exceeds will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to and of the higher of the Market Value and
the Newly Issued Price, respectively. 

The Private Placement Warrants are identical to
the Public Warrants, except that, so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees, (i) they will not be redeemable
by the Company, (ii) they (including the Class A Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of these Warrants) may not, subject to certain
limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the Sponsor until days after the completion of the Initial Business Combination,
(iii) they may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis, (iv) are subject to registration rights and (v) use a different Black-Scholes
Warrant Model for purposes of calculating the Black-Scholes Warrant Value (as defined in the warrant agreement). 

On the exercise of any Warrant, the Warrant exercise
price will be paid directly to us and not placed in the Trust Account.

A Ordinary Share equals or exceeds : Once the Warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding Warrants (except

The Company will not redeem the Warrants as described
above unless an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the Class A Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise
of the Warrants is effective and a current prospectus relating to those Class A Ordinary Shares is available throughout the 30-day redemption
period. Any such exercise would not be on a cashless basis and would require the exercising warrant holder to pay the exercise price for
each Warrant being exercised.

if, and only if, the closing price of Class A Ordinary Shares equals or exceeds per Public Share (as adjusted) for any trading days within the -trading day period ending three trading days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders; and 

if the closing price of the Class A Ordinary Shares for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders is less than per share (as adjusted), the Private Placement Warrants must also be concurrently called for redemption on the same terms as the outstanding Public Warrants, as described above. 

Solely for the purposes of this redemption provision,

of the Class A Ordinary Shares for the ten (10) trading days immediately following the date on which notice of redemption is sent to the
holders of Warrants.

Overview 

We are a blank check company incorporated in Cayman
Islands on February 25, 2021. The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition,
ordinary share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, or the Business Combination. 
The Company is an emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with emerging growth companies. 

On
May 9, 2024 the Company received a written notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market Nasdaq indicating that since the Company s aggregate market value of its outstanding warrants was less than 1 million, the Company
was no longer in compliance with the Nasdaq Global Market continued listing criteria set forth in Listing Rule 5452(b)(C), which requires
the Company to maintain an aggregate market value of its outstanding warrants of at least 1 million. 

On November 7, 2024, the Company received a further
written notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq indicating that the Company s warrants and units would be subject
to suspension and delisting from The Nasdaq Global Market at the opening of business on November 18, 2024 due to the Company s non-compliance
with: (i) in relation to the warrants, Nasdaq Listing Rule 5452(b)(C), which requires the Company to maintain an aggregate market value
of its outstanding warrants of at least 1 million; and (ii) in relation to the units, Nasdaq Listing Rule 5225(a)(1)(A), which requires
that all components of the unit comply with the requirements for continued listing.

Initial Business Combination 

The Company s management has broad discretion
with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the IPO, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to
be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business
Combination successfully. The Company must complete one or more initial Business Combinations having an aggregate fair market value of
at least 80 of the net assets held in the Trust Account (as defined below) (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting commission
held in Trust and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial Business
Combination. However, the Company only intends to complete a Business Combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires
50 or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient
for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act 1940, as amended (the Investment
Company Act ). Upon the closing of the IPO, management has agreed that an amount equal to at least 10.30 per Unit sold in the IPO,
including the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, will be held in a trust account Trust Account located in the United States with Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company acting as trustee, and invested only in United States
 government securities within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 185 days
or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest
only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business
Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below. The Company will provide the holders (the Public
Shareholders of the Company s issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares, par value 0.0001 per share, sold in the IPO
(the Public Shares with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business
Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender
offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will
be made by the Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then held in the Trust Account. The per-share amount to be distributed
to Public Shareholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay
to the underwriters. If the Company seeks shareholder approval, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if a majority of
the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a shareholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not
decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Articles
of Association (the Articles of Association ), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If,
however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain shareholder approval for business
or legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem the Public Shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules
and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective
of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with a Business
Combination, the initial shareholders (as defined below) have agreed to vote their Founder Shares (as defined below) and any Public Shares
purchased during or after the IPO in favor of a Business Combination. In addition, the initial shareholders have agreed to waive their
redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and Public Shares in connection with the completion of a Business Combination. 

The Articles of Association will provide that
a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert
or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )),
will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15 of the Public Shares, without the prior consent
of the Company. The holders of the Founder Shares (the initial shareholders have agreed not to propose an amendment to
the Articles of Association (A) to modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to allow redemption in connection
with a Business Combination or to redeem 100 of the Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the
Combination Period (as defined below) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders rights or pre-initial
Business Combination activity, unless the Company provides the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares
in conjunction with any such amendment. 

If the Company is unable to complete a Business
Combination within 42 months from the closing of the IPO (or September 14, 2025) and the Company s shareholders have not amended
the Articles of Association to extend such Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding
up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter subject to lawfully available funds therefor,
redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including
interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its taxes, if any (less up to
 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely
extinguish Public Shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any),
subject to applicable law; and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining
shareholders and the board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Cayman
law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.

The initial shareholders have agreed to waive
their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a
Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the initial shareholders acquire Public Shares after the IPO, they will
be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the 

The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights
to the deferred underwriting commission held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination before
the Company s termination date as described above, and in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in
the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible
that the per share value of the residual assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be only 10.30.
In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any
claims by a third party (except for the Company s independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products
sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement (a Target ),
reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (i) 10.30 per unit or (ii) the lesser amount per Public Share held in the Trust
Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of
interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or Target that
executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account nor will it apply to any claims under the Company s
indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the Securities Act ). In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor
will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that
the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers
(other than the Company s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which
the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies
held in the Trust Account. 

Results of Operations 

We have neither engaged in any operations nor
generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from February 25, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2024 were organizational
activities, those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering, described below, and the Company s search for a target business
with which to complete a Business Combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial
Business Combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of realized gains on the investments held in the trust account. We
are incurring expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as
well as for due diligence expenses in connection with completing a Business Combination. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024,
we reported net income of 813,995 which consists of change in fair value of derivative warrant liabilities of 306,800, realized gain
on the investments held in the trust account of 714,328, offset by interest on related party promissory note of 12,252, and general
and administrative expenses of 194,881 (made up of professional services fees of 65,986 and other general and administrative fees of
 128,895). 

For the three months ended September 30, 2023
we reported net income of 1,766,214 which consists of general and administrative expenses of 241,063 (made up of professional services
fees of 75,095 and other general and administrative fees of 165,968), change in fair value of derivative warrant liabilities of (353,600)
and realized gain on the investments held in the trust account of 2,360,877. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
we reported net income of 4,283,432 which consists of realized gain on the investments held in the trust account of 5,404,525, offset
by change in fair value of derivative warrant liabilities of 338,000, interest on related party promissory note of 18,047, and general
and administrative expenses of 765,046 (made up of professional services fees of 352,780 and other general and administrative fees of
 412,266). 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 we
reported net income of 7,453,331 which consists of general and administrative expenses of 928,551 (made up of professional services
fees of 442,116 and other general and administrative fees of 486,435), change in fair value of derivative warrant liabilities of 780,000
and realized gain on the investments held in the trust account of 7,601,882.

Liquidity and Going Concern Consideration 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had working
capital of 43,305,023 including the Trust Account, deferred underwriting fees payable. Working capital was (4,783,686) when marketable
securities held in Trust Account, deferred underwriting fees payable, and derivative warrant liabilities were excluded from the calculation.
Of the net proceeds from the IPO and associated sale of Private Placement Warrants, 236,900,000 of cash was placed in the Trust Account.
The working capital surplus includes the amount of restricted marketable securities held in the Trust Account, deferred underwriting fees
payable and derivative warrant liabilities, all of which have been classified as current at September 30, 2024. The Company s ability
to continue operations through the liquidation date is contingent on the payment of the monthly extension deposit. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
cash used in operating activities was 1,013,376, which is made up of a net income of 4,283,432, changes in operating assets and liabilities
of 338,330. These amounts were offset by a gain on Investments held in the Trust account of 5,404,525, deemed contribution for administrative
support - related party of 90,000, interest on related party promissory note of 18,047, and change in fair value of derivative warrant
liabilities of 338,000. Cash of 8,670 was held outside of the Trust Account and is available for the Company s working capital
purposes. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 8,670.
We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence
on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their
representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, structure, negotiate and
complete a Business Combination. 

In order to finance transaction costs in connection
with an Initial Business Combination, the Company s sponsor, or an affiliate of the sponsor or certain of the Company s officers
and directors may, but are not obligated to, provide Working Capital Loans to the Company. As of September 30, 2024, there were no amounts
outstanding under any Working Capital Loans. 

If the Company s estimates of the costs
of identifying a target business, undertaking due diligence and negotiating an Initial Business Combination are less than the actual amount
necessary to do so, the Company may have insufficient funds available to operate its business prior to an Initial Business Combination.
Moreover, the Company may need to obtain additional financing either to complete an Initial Business Combination or because it becomes
obligated to redeem a significant number of its Public Shares upon completion of an Initial Business Combination, in which case the Company
may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Initial Business Combination. 

The
Company anticipates that the cash held outside of the Trust Account as of September 30, 2024 will not be sufficient to allow the
Company to operate for at least the next 12 months from the issuance of the unaudited condensed financial statements, assuming that
a Business Combination is not consummated during that time. Over this time period, the Company will be using the funds held outside
of the Trust Account for paying existing accounts payable and accrued liabilities, identifying and evaluating prospective initial
Business Combination candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures,
selecting the target business to merge with or acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination.
These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of time
within one year after the date that the unaudited condensed financial statements are issued. Management plans to address this
uncertainty through the Business Combination as discussed above. In addition, the sponsor or an affiliate of the sponsor, or certain
of the Company s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required under the
Working Capital Loans. There is no assurance that the Company s plans to consummate the Business Combination will be
successful or successful within the Combination Period or that the sponsor or an affiliate of the sponsor, or certain of the
Company s officers and directors will loan the Company funds as may be required under the Working Capital Loans. We also
deposited 300,000 monthly through June 14, 2024 (end date of the first extension) and 68,121 starting July 14, 2024 (start date of
the second extension) into the Trust Account to effect the extension of the termination date and provide time for us to complete a
business combination. As of September 30, 2024, we had deposited 3,872,484 in aggregate in connection with these extensions as
disclosed in Note 1 of the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements. This amount allowed us to extend the termination
date through October 14, 2024. Following September 30, 2024, we made additional deposits totaling 136,042 to extend the termination
date to December 14, 2024. 

The unaudited condensed financial statements do
not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary
should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

25 

Commitments and Contractual Obligations 

We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease
obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities. 

The underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee
of 0.35 per Unit, or 8,050,000 in the aggregate. The deferred fee will be waived by the underwriters in the event that the Company does
not complete a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. 

On December 4, 2023, the Company received an executed
deferred underwriting fees waiver letter from J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, one of the Company s underwriters, informing the Company
of its decision to waive any entitlement it may have to its deferred underwriting fees payable held in the Trust Account in respect of
any Business Combination. The waiver does not cover deferred underwriting fees payable to Citigroup Global Market Inc. (representing 50 
of the total deferred underwriting fees payable, or 4,025,000). 

Administrative Services Agreement 

Following our IPO, the Company pays the Sponsor
or an affiliate a monthly fee of 10,000 for office space, utilities, secretarial and administrative services. In August 2023, the Company
and its Sponsor executed an agreement to discontinue the remittance of administrative fees to the Sponsor with an effective date of August
1, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred 90,000 and 60,000 in administrative support fees respectively. 

Registration Rights 

The holders of Founder Shares and Private Placement
Warrants, including any that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans, if any (and any Class A ordinary shares issuable
upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants, including any that may be issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans), will
be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into prior to the consummation of the IPO. These
holders will be entitled to certain demand and piggyback registration rights. However, the registration rights agreement
provides that the Company is not required to effect or permit any registration or cause any registration statement to become effective
until termination of the applicable lock-up period. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such
registration statements. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of the unaudited condensed financial
statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual
results could materially differ from those estimates. We have not identified any critical accounting estimates. 

Recent Accounting Standards 

See Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
in Note 2 of the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements. 

JOBS Act 

The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012
(the JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public
companies. We qualify as an emerging growth company and under the JOBS Act are allowed to comply with new or revised accounting
pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or
revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which
adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, the unaudited condensed financial statements may
not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. 

Additionally, we are in the process of evaluating
the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth
in the JOBS Act, if, as an emerging growth company, we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to, among
other things, (i) provide an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to
Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory
audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the unaudited condensed
financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis) and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation
between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO s compensation to median employee compensation. These
exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our Initial Public Offering or until we are no longer an
 emerging growth company, whichever is earlier.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined
by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed
with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Report,
is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls
are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management
evaluated, with the participation of our current chief executive officer and chief financial officer (our Certifying Officers ),
the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act.
Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September
30, 2024 due to the material weaknesses described below. 

In the preparation of the Company s annual
report for fiscal year 2023, we identified errors in the presentation and disclosure of earnings per share related to the waived deferred
underwriter fees and the calculation of weighted average number of shares outstanding, Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption
and related accretion, certain supplemental disclosures on the statement of cash flows and certain disclosures in the financial statements
related to comparative information, as well as incomplete disclosures in the Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources and
Critical Accounting Policies sections in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
These errors were corrected in the financial statements attached to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
As part of such process, management concluded that material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting existed related to
the process of presentation and disclosure. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over
financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

We do not expect that our disclosure controls
and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and
operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met.
Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances
of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of
future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 

In light of these material weaknesses, we plan
to enhance our presentation and disclosure controls. Our plans currently include extensive research on complex accounting topics and training
of management personnel. The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time, and we can offer no assurance that these
initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a- 15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal
quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
