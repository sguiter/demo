Executive Overview 
 We are a global financial and business services company with operations in the Americas, Europe and Australia. Our primary business is the purchase, collection and management of portfolios of nonperforming loans. We are headquartered in Norfolk, Virginia, and our shares of common stock are traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol "PRAA". 
 Overview 
 Our third quarter financial results reflected both strong cash collections and portfolio acquisitions, and over the past 18 months we have built out a highly experienced senior leadership team, capitalized on the rebound in U.S. portfolio supply, executed on our cash-generating and operational initiatives with speed and discipline, and driven the financial and operational turnaround in our U.S. business, while continuing to differentiate ourselves in Europe. 
 We purchased 350.0 million of portfolios during the third quarter of 2024, consisting of 273.8 million in the Americas and 76.2 million in Europe. Year-to-date, we purchased 975.2 million globally. Total portfolio revenue was 276.7 million during the third quarter of 2024, with portfolio income increasing 13.8 year-over-year. Cash collections were geographically diversified and increased 13.7 compared to the third quarter of 2023, reflecting higher portfolio purchases in both the U.S. and Europe and the positive impact of our cash-generating initiatives. As of September 30, 2024, ERC was 7.3 billion, an increase of 22.1 from 6.0 billion as of September 30, 2023. 
 U.S. 
 In the U.S., we purchased 231.2 million of portfolios during the third quarter, an increase of 34.7 compared to the prior year period. We continue to capitalize on strong levels of portfolio supply driven by the growth in industry credit card balances and higher delinquency and charge-off rates, while pricing in the U.S. has remained attractive. We have made a number of operational execution improvements to our U.S. call center operations, while improving the cycle time of our legal collections channel. As part of our expense management initiatives, we recently announced the decision to expand our work from home program and close three of our U.S. call centers by mid-2025. 
 Despite some positive trends, we believe certain U.S. consumer segments remain under pressure, and to the extent there is pressure impacting our U.S. Core non-legal channel, we have a number of customer strategies in-place; including, the ability to tailor payment plans according to our customers' evolving financial situations, which allows us to work closely with them and to continue generating cash over the long term. The legal channel, which is not our first option, is the channel we use when customers choose not to engage with us voluntarily and is a growing channel for us as part of our cash-generating initiatives. Given the elongated time period over which we realize collections in the legal channel, it is less impacted by near-term consumer pressures. Looking ahead to 2025, we expect overall U.S. portfolio supply to remain elevated. 
 Europe 
 Quarterly purchasing in Europe decreased by 4.0 in the current year period. The European market is more spot-driven, and historically, we have generally experienced strong levels of portfolio purchases in the second and fourth quarters, and we anticipate this trend will continue in 2024. While some of our peers have faced challenges, we have successfully grown ERC over time, leveraging our diversified presence across multiple European markets. 
 With a tenured and stable management team, deep seller relationships and a highly efficient operating structure, we believe that the breadth of our European business differentiates us from most of our competitors. We continue to approach portfolio investments in a disciplined manner and believe that we are well-positioned to take advantage of purchasing opportunities across Europe.

Results of Operations 
 Three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 ("Q3 2024" and "2024 year-to-date") compared to three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 ("Q3 2023" and "2023 year-to-date"). 
 Cash Collections 
 Cash collections were as follows for the periods indicated (amounts in thousands): 
 Third Quarter Year-to-Date 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change Americas and Australia Core 266,977 223,714 43,263 19.3 787,666 672,560 115,106 17.1 Americas Insolvency 26,065 27,809 (1,744) (6.3) 78,244 79,944 (1,700) (2.1) Europe Core 158,242 144,402 13,840 9.6 460,914 427,731 33,183 7.8 Europe Insolvency 25,826 23,639 2,187 9.3 73,686 69,932 3,754 5.4 Cash collections 477,110 419,564 57,546 13.7 1,400,510 1,250,167 150,343 12.0 Cash collections adjusted (1)

 (1) Cash collections adjusted refers to prior year period foreign currency cash collections remeasured at average U.S. dollar exchange rates for the current year period. 
 Cash collections were 477.1 million in Q3 2024, an increase of 57.5 million, or 13.7 , compared to 419.6 million in Q3 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in U.S. Core cash collections of 44.8 million, mainly due to the impact of higher recent purchasing levels and our cash-generating initiatives, particularly in the legal collections channel. Also contributing to the increase were increased cash collections in Europe of 16.0 million, primarily due to higher recent purchasing levels. 
 Year-to-date cash collections increased by 150.3 million, or 12.0 , reflecting an increase of 108.3 million in U.S. Core cash collections and higher cash collections in Europe of 36.9 million. The increase was primarily due to the same factors impacting the quarterly period. 
 Portfolio Revenue 
 Total portfolio revenue was as follows for the periods indicated (amounts in thousands): 
 Third Quarter Year-to-Date 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change Portfolio income 216,122 189,960 26,162 13.8 627,468 562,492 64,976 11.6 Changes in expected recoveries 60,614 22,156 38,458 173.6 185,608 6,380 179,228 2,809.2 Total portfolio revenue 276,736 212,116 64,620 30.5 813,076 568,872 244,204 42.9 
 Total portfolio revenue was 276.7 million in Q3 2024, an increase of 64.6 million, or 30.5 , compared to 212.1 million in Q3 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase of 38.5 million in changes in expected recoveries, driven by cash collections overperformance in the U.S., due in part to our cash-generating initiatives, as well as cash collections overperformance in Europe. Furthermore, in the U.S. and Europe, based primarily on overperformance in recent periods, there was a larger net increase to the ERC of certain pools in Q3 2024 compared to Q3 2023. The increase of 26.2 million in portfolio income was primarily due to the impact of higher purchasing and improved pricing in the U.S. beginning in 2023. 
 Year-to-date portfolio revenue increased by 244.2 million, or 42.9 , primarily due to an increase of 179.2 million in changes in expected recoveries, driven mainly by a net increase to the ERC of certain pools in the U.S. and Europe compared to net decreases in the prior year period, as well as cash collections overperformance in the U.S. and Europe. The 65.0 million increase in portfolio income was primarily due to the impact of higher purchasing and improved pricing in the U.S. beginning in 2023.

Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses were as follows for the periods indicated (amounts in thousands): 
 Third Quarter Year-to-Date 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change Compensation and employee services 76,106 69,517 6,589 9.5 223,944 217,708 6,236 2.9 Legal collection fees 14,479 9,839 4,640 47.2 40,353 28,228 12,125 43.0 Legal collection costs 28,781 20,761 8,020 38.6 90,746 66,228 24,518 37.0 Agency fees 21,020 19,436 1,584 8.1 61,751 54,491 7,260 13.3 Outside fees and services 20,452 18,858 1,594 8.5 63,626 62,064 1,562 2.5 Communication 10,048 9,881 167 1.7 34,203 30,525 3,678 12.0 Rent and occupancy 4,175 4,426 (251) (5.7) 12,455 13,193 (738) (5.6) Depreciation and amortization 2,469 3,273 (804) (24.6) 7,826 10,344 (2,518) (24.3) Impairment of real estate 5,037 (5,037) (100.0) 5,037 (5,037) (100.0) Other operating expenses 13,969 12,356 1,613 13.1 40,792 38,355 2,437 6.4 Total operating expenses 191,499 173,384 18,115 10.4 575,696 526,173 49,523 9.4 
 Compensation and employee services 
 Q3 2024 compensation and employee services expense increased 6.6 million, or 9.5 , mainly reflecting lower compensation accruals and benefits related expenses in Q3 2023 and higher wage costs in the current year period. The 2024 year-to-date expense increased by 6.2 million, due largely to higher wage costs and compensation accruals in the current year period, partially offset by 8.6 million of severance related expenses in the prior year period. We continue to leverage third parties and offshore call centers to partially offset the costs associated with a significant increase in account volumes and customer contacts. 
 Legal collection fees 
 Legal collection fees represent contingent fees incurred for cash collections generated by our third-party attorney network. Q3 2024 fees increased 4.6 million, or 47.2 , mainly reflecting higher external legal collections within our U.S. Core portfolio. Increased external legal collections in the U.S. were also the primary driver of the 12.1 million, or 43.0 , increase for the year-to-date period. 
 Legal collection costs 
 Legal collection costs consist primarily of costs paid to courts where a lawsuit is filed for the purpose of attempting to collect on an account. Q3 2024 costs increased 8.0 million, or 38.6 , primarily due to increased activity in our U.S. legal collections channel, as well as the expansion of legal collection activities in Europe. The growth of legal collections activity in both the U.S. and Europe also drove the 24.5 million, or 37.0 , increase for the year-to-date period. 
 Agency fees 
 Agency fees primarily represent third-party collection fees. Higher collection fees on certain pools in Brazil drove the Q3 2024 increase of 1.6 million, while both higher collection fees and increased cash collections drove the 7.3 million, or 13.3 , increase for the year-to-date period. 
 Communication 
 Communication expense relates mainly to correspondence, network and calling costs associated with our collection efforts. An expansion in account volumes drove both the marginal Q3 2024 increase of 0.2 million and the 3.7 million, or 12.0 , increase for the year-to-date period. 
 Impairment of real estate 
 Impairment of real estate was 5.0 million for both the Q3 2023 and 2023 year-to-date periods due to an impairment charge associated with our decision to cease call center operations at one of our owned regional offices in the U.S. No impairment has been recorded in 2024, and the property is being marketed for sale or lease.

Interest Expense, Net 
 Interest expense, net was as follows for the periods indicated (amounts in thousands): Third Quarter Year-to-Date 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change Interest on debt obligations and unused line fees 34,006 31,161 2,845 9.1 101,140 78,139 23,001 29.4 Interest on senior notes 25,368 18,433 6,935 37.6 65,816 51,672 14,144 27.4 Coupon interest on convertible notes 5,031 (5,031) (100.0) Amortization of loan fees and other loan costs 3,795 2,220 1,575 70.9 8,326 7,045 1,281 18.2 Interest income (2,107) (2,341) 234 (10.0) (6,589) (11,109) 4,520 (40.7) Interest expense, net 61,062 49,473 11,589 23.4 168,693 130,778 37,915 29.0 
 Interest expense, net was 61.1 million in Q3 2024, an increase of 11.6 million, or 23.4 , compared to 49.5 million in Q3 2023. The increase was primarily due to a higher average debt balance in the current year period to support higher levels of portfolio investments. Interest expense, net increased by 37.9 million, or 29.0 , for the year-to-date period, driven by higher average debt balances and increased interest rates compared to the prior year period. 
 Income Tax Expense/(Benefit) 
 Income tax expense/(benefit) and our effective tax rate were as follows for the periods indicated (amounts in thousands): 
 Third Quarter Year-to-Date 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change Income tax expense/(benefit) (672) 1,788 (2,460) (137.6) 10,416 (15,317) 25,733 168.0 Effective tax rate (2.4) (28.1) 25.7 13.7 20.1 (6.4) 
 In both the third quarter and year-to-date periods, Income tax expense/(benefit) was impacted by higher income before tax in the current year periods, offset by a 7.7 million reduction in tax expense due to the reversal of a valuation allowance associated with the resolution of a tax matter in Europe. The effective tax rate was also impacted by higher income before taxes in the current year periods, as well as changes in the mix of income from different taxing jurisdictions and the timing and amount of discrete items, including reversal of the valuation allowance. 
 Balance Sheet 
 Finance receivables, net 
 Finance receivables, net were 4.1 billion as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 407.9 million, or 11.2 , compared to 3.7 billion as of December 31, 2023, driven largely by portfolio acquisitions of 975.2 million and changes in expected recoveries of 185.6 million, partially offset by recoveries applied to the negative allowance of 784.3 million. 
 Compared to September 30, 2023, finance receivables, net increased by 603.7 million, driven largely by portfolio acquisitions of 1.3 billion and changes in expected recoveries of 208.4 million, partially offset by recoveries applied to the negative allowance of 1.0 billion. 
 Borrowings 
 Borrowings were 3.3 billion as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 381.9 million, or 13.1 , compared to 2.9 billion as of December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to incremental net borrowings under our North American revolving credit facility of 289.0 million and net borrowings under our senior notes of 102.0 million during the period. 
 Compared to September 30, 2023, borrowings increased by 463.9 million. The increase was primarily due to incremental net borrowings under our North American revolving credit facility of 305.0 million, additional net borrowings under our senior notes of 102.0 million and net borrowings of 63.3 million under our European revolving credit facility.

Supplemental Performance Data 
 Finance Receivables Portfolio Performance 
 We purchase portfolios of nonperforming loans from a variety of credit originators, or acquire portfolios through strategic acquisitions, and segregate them into two main portfolio segments: Core or Insolvency, based on the status of the account upon acquisition. In addition, the accounts are segregated into geographical regions based upon where the account was acquired. Ultimately, accounts are aggregated into annual pools based on portfolio segment, geography and year of acquisition. Portfolios of accounts that were in an insolvency status at the time of acquisition are represented in the Insolvency tables below. All other acquisitions of portfolios of accounts are included in our Core portfolio tables as represented below. Once an account is initially segregated, it is not later transferred from an Insolvency pool to a Core pool, or vice versa, and the account continues to be accounted for as originally segregated regardless of any future changes in operational status. Specifically, if a Core account files for bankruptcy or insolvency protection after acquisition, we adjust our collection practices to comply with any respective bankruptcy or insolvency rules or policies; however, for accounting purposes, the account remains in the Core pool. In the event an Insolvency account is dismissed from its bankruptcy or insolvency status whether voluntarily or involuntarily, we are typically free to pursue alternative collection activities; however, the account remains in the Insolvency pool. 
 The purchase price multiple represents our estimate of total cash collections over the original purchase price of the portfolio. Purchase price multiples can vary over time due to a variety of factors, including pricing competition, supply levels, paper type, age of the accounts acquired, mix of portfolios purchased, costs to collect, expected returns and changes in operational efficiency. For example, increased pricing due to elevated levels of competition or supply constraints negatively impacts purchase price multiples as we pay more to buy similar portfolios of nonperforming loans. 
 Further, there is an inverse relationship between the price we pay for a portfolio, the purchase price multiple and the effective interest rate of the pool. When we pay more for a portfolio, the purchase price multiple and effective interest rates are generally lower. The opposite tends to occur when we pay less for a portfolio. Certain types of accounts have lower collection costs, and we generally pay more for these types of accounts, resulting in a lower purchase price multiple but similar net income margins when compared with other portfolio purchases. Within a given portfolio type, when lower purchase price multiples are the result of more competitive pricing, this generally leads to lower profitability. As portfolio pricing becomes more favorable, our profitability will tend to increase. Profitability within given Core portfolio types may also be impacted by the age and quality of the accounts, which impact the cost to collect those accounts. Fresher accounts, for example, typically carry lower associated collection costs, while older accounts and lower balance accounts typically carry higher costs and, as a result, require higher purchase price multiples to achieve the same net profitability as fresher paper. 
 Revenue recognition is driven by estimates of the amount and timing of future cash collections. We record new portfolio acquisitions at the purchase price, which reflects the amount we expect to collect discounted at an effective interest rate. During the year of acquisition, portfolios are aggregated into annual pools, and the blended effective interest rate will change to reflect new buying and new cash flow estimates until the end of the year. At that time, the purchase price amount is fixed at the aggregated amounts paid to acquire the portfolio, the effective interest rate is fixed at the amount we expect to collect, discounted at the rate to equate purchase price to the recovery estimate, and the currency rates are fixed for purposes of comparability in future periods. Depending on the level of performance and expected future impacts from our operations, we may update ERC and TEC levels based on the results of our cash forecasting with a correlating adjustment to the purchase price multiple. We follow an established process to evaluate ERC, and we typically do not adjust our ERC and TEC until we gain sufficient collection experience with a pool of accounts. Over time, our TEC has often increased as pools have aged resulting in the ratio of TEC to purchase price for any given year of buying to gradually increase. 
 The numbers presented in the following tables represent gross cash collections and do not reflect any costs to collect; therefore, they may not represent relative profitability. Due to all of the factors described above, readers should be cautious when making comparisons of purchase price multiples among periods and between types of categories of portfolio segments and related geographies.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We report our financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). However, our management also uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, including: 
 adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA"), to evaluate the Company's performance and to set performance goals; and 
 return on average tangible equity ("ROATE"), as a measure to monitor and evaluate operating performance relative to the Company's equity. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 We present Adjusted EBITDA because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operational and financial performance. Our management believes Adjusted EBITDA helps provide enhanced period-to-period comparability of our operational and financial performance, as it excludes certain items whose fluctuations from period-to-period do not necessarily correspond to changes in the operations of our business, and is useful to investors as other companies in the industry report similar financial measures. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to the calculation of similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated starting with our GAAP financial measure, Net income/(loss) attributable to PRA Group, Inc. and is adjusted for: 
 income tax expense (or less income tax benefit); 
 foreign exchange loss (or less foreign exchange gain); 
 interest expense, net (or less interest income, net); 
 other expense (or less other income); 
 35 

depreciation and amortization; 
 impairment of real estate; 
 net income attributable to noncontrolling interests; and 
 recoveries applied to negative allowance less changes in expected recoveries. 
 The following table provides a reconciliation of Net income/(loss) attributable to PRA Group, Inc. as reported in accordance with GAAP to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated (amounts in thousands):

 (1) Other expense reflects non-operating activities. 
 Return on Average Tangible Equity 
 We use ROATE, which is a supplemental measure of performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP, to monitor and evaluate operating performance relative to the Company's equity. Management believes ROATE is a useful financial measure for investors in evaluating the effective use of equity, and is an important component of our long-term shareholder return. Average tangible equity ("ATE") is defined as average Total stockholders' equity - PRA Group, Inc. less average goodwill and average other intangible assets. ROATE is calculated by dividing annualized Net income/(loss) attributable to PRA Group, Inc. by ATE. 
 The following table displays our ROATE and provides a reconciliation of Total stockholders' equity - PRA Group, Inc. as reported in accordance with GAAP to ATE for the periods indicated (amounts in thousands, except for ratio data):

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We actively manage our liquidity to meet our business needs and financial obligations. 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Cash and cash equivalents . As of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled 141.1 million, of which 132.4 million consisted of cash on-hand related to international operations with indefinitely reinvested earnings. For additional information about the unremitted earnings of our international subsidiaries, refer to Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Borrowings. As of September 30, 2024, we had the following committed amounts, borrowings and availability under our credit facilities (amounts in thousands):

 (1) Available borrowings after calculation of borrowing base, subject to the committed amounts and debt covenants, which may be used for general corporate purposes, including portfolio purchases. 
 (2) Subject to borrowing base and debt covenants, including advance rates ranging from 35-55 of applicable ERC. 
 For additional details about our credit facilities, term loan and senior notes, refer to Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 
 Interest-bearing deposits. As of September 30, 2024, interest-bearing deposits totaled 128.6 million. Under our European revolving credit facility, our interest-bearing deposit funding is limited to SEK 2.2 billion (the equivalent of 216.6 million in U.S. dollars as of September 30, 2024). 
 Furthermore, we have the ability to slow the purchase of nonperforming loans and to use the net cash flow generated from cash collections on our portfolio of existing nonperforming loans to temporarily service our debt and fund existing operat ions. 
 Uses of Liquidity and Material Cash Requirements 
 Forward Flows. We enter into forward flow agreements for the purchase of nonperforming loans. These agreements typically have terms ranging from three to 12 months, or they can be open-ended, and establish purchase prices and specific criteria for the accounts to be purchased. Some of the agreements establish a volume reference for the contract term in the form of a target or maximum, however, very few agreements establish a minimum contractual obligation, and many of the contracts contain early termination provisions allowing either party to cancel the agreements in accordance with a specified notice period. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have forward flow agreements in place with an estimated purchase price of approximately 491.1 million over the next 12 months. This total can vary significantly based on the remaining terms and renewal dates of the agreements and is comprised of 406.3 million for the Americas and Australia and 84.8 million for Europe. These amounts represent our estimated forward flow purchases over the next 12 months under the agreements in place, based on projections and other factors, including sellers' estimates of future flow sales, and are dependent on actual delivery by the sellers. Accordingly, amounts purchased under these agreements may vary significantly. In addition to these agreements, we may also enter into new or renewed forward flow commitments and/or close on spot purchase transactions. 

37 

Borrowings . As of September 30, 2024, we had 3.3 billion in outstanding borr owings. The estimated interest, unused fees and principal payments for the next 12 months are 229.4 million, of which 10.0 million rel ates to principal on our term loan. After 12 months, principal payments on our debt are due from betwee n one and five year s. Many of our financing arrangements include covenants with which we must comply, and as of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with these covenants. 
 On September 3, 2024, using funds obtained primarily from our North American revolving credit facility, we repaid our Senior Notes due 2025 (the "2025 Notes") in full by redeeming 298.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes at par value. 
 Share Repurchases . On February 25, 2022, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to 150.0 million of our outstanding common stock. The share repurchase program has no stated expiration date and does not obligate us to repurchase any specified amount of shares, remains subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and, subject to compliance with applicable laws, may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. 
 Repurchases may be made from time-to-time in open market transactions, through privately negotiated transactions, in block transactions, through purchases made in accordance with trading plans adopted under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or other methods, subject to market and/or other conditions and applicable regulatory requirements. Repurchases are also subject to restrictive covenants contained in our credit facilities and the indentures that govern our senior notes. There were no repurchases during the third quarter of 2024, and as of September 30, 2024, we had 67.7 million remaining for share repurchases under the program. 
 Leases. Our leases have remaining terms from one to 11 years. As of September 30, 2024, we had 45.2 million in lease liabilities, of which 9.2 million is due within the next 12 months. For additional information about our leases, refer to Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Derivatives . We enter into derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on variable rate debt and foreign currency exchange rates. As of September 30, 2024 , we h ad 9.3 million of de rivative liabilities , of which 0.4 million matures within one year . The remaining 8.9 million matures in 2028 . For additional information, refer to N ote 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements i ncluded in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 
 Investments. As of September 30, 2024, we held 50.6 million in Swedish treasury securities to meet the liquidity requirements of the Swedish Financial Services Authority for our banking subsidiary, AK Nordic AB. 
 We believe that funds generated from our business activities, together with existing cash, available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and access to the capital markets, will be sufficient to finance our operations, planned capital expenditures, forward flow purchase commitments, debt maturities and additional portfolio purchases during the next 12 months and beyond. Market conditions permitting, as we deem appropriate, we may seek to access the debt or equity capital markets or other sources of funding, and it may be necessary to raise additional funds to achieve our business objectives. Business acquisitions or higher than expected levels of portfolio purchasing could require additional financing. We may also, from time-to-time, repurchase senior notes in the open market or otherwise. 
 Cash Flow Analysis 
 The following table summarizes our year-to-date cash flow activity for the periods indicated (amounts in thousands): 
 Year-to-Date 2024 2023 Change Net cash provided by/(used in): Operating activities (137,524) (118,272) (19,252) Investing activities (183,833) (179,589) (4,244) Financing activities 347,073 328,251 18,822 Effect of exchange rate on cash 3,024 3,270 (246) Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 28,740 33,660 (4,920) 

38 

Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities mainly reflects the portion of our cash collections recognized as revenue and cash paid for operating expenses, interest and income taxes. It does not include cash collections applied to the negative allowance, which are classified as cash flows used in investing activities. To calculate net cash used in operating activities, net income/(loss) was adjusted for (i) non-cash items included in net income/(loss), such as unrealized foreign currency transaction gains/(losses), changes in expected recoveries, depreciation, amortization and impairment, deferred income taxes, fair value changes in equity securities, and share-based compensation, as well as (ii) changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities, which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments. 
 Cash used in operating activities was 137.5 million 2024 year-to-date compared to 118.3 million in the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to higher cash paid for interest and operating expenses, partially offset by higher cash collections recognized as income, lower income tax payments and a lower impact from foreign currency transactions. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased 4.2 million compared to the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to an increase of 99.8 million in purchases of nonperforming loan portfolios, partially offset by an increase of 88.9 million in recoveries applied to the negative allowance and a 7.2 million increase in net cash flows from purchases and disposals of investments. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities increased 18.8 million compared to the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to a net increase of 21.1 million in interest-bearing deposits and 7.2 million increase in net proceeds from lines of credit and senior notes, partially offset by a net increase of 13.3 million in distributions to noncontrolling interests. 
 During the second quarter of 2024, we repaid 395.9 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding borrowings under our North American revolving credit agreement with net proceeds obtained from the issuance of our Senior Notes due 2030. On September 3, 2024, using funds obtained primarily from our North American revolving credit facility, we repaid our 2025 Notes in full by redeeming 298.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes at par value. For additional details about these transactions, refer to Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 For discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and the anticipated effects on our Consolidated Financial Statements, refer to Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Some of our significant accounting policies require that we use estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates, refer to Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 We consider accounting estimates to be critical if they (1) involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and (2) have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We base our estimates on historical experience, current trends and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. If these estimates differ significantly from actual results, the impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements may be material. We have determined that the following accounting policies involve critical estimates: 
 Revenue Recognition - Finance Receivables 
 Revenue recognition for finance receivables involves the use of estimates and the exercise of judgment on the part of management. These estimates include projections of the amount and timing of cash collections we expect to receive from our pools of accounts. We review individual pools for trends, actual performance versus projections and curve shape (a graphical depiction of the amount and timing of cash collections). We then project ERC and apply a discounted cash flow methodology to our ERC. Adjustments to ERC may include adjustments reflecting recent collection trends, our view of current and future economic conditions, changes in collection assumptions or other timing related adjustments. 
 39 

Significant changes in our cash flow estimates could result in increased or decreased revenue as we immediately recognize the discounted value of such changes using the constant effective interest rate of the pool. Generally, adjustments to cash forecasts result in an adjustment to revenue at an amount less than the impact of the performance in the period due to the effects of discounting. Additionally, cash collection forecast increases will result in more revenue being recognized and cash collection forecast decreases in less revenue being recognized over the life of the pool. 
 Goodwill 
 In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") ASC Topic 350, "Intangibles-Goodwill and Other" ("ASC 350"), we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of October 1, and more frequently if circumstances indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. 
 We determine the fair value of a reporting unit by applying approaches prescribed under ASC Topic 820 "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures": the income approach and the market approach. Under the income approach, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows and a residual terminal value. Cash flow projections are based on management's estimates of a variety of factors, including growth rates and operating margins, which take into consideration industry and market conditions. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value based on market trading multiples and other relevant market transactions involving comparable publicly traded companies with operating and investment characteristics similar to the reporting unit. Depending on the availability of public data and suitable comparable transaction data, we may give more weight to the income approach than the market approach. We also assess the reasonableness of the aggregate estimated fair value of our reporting units by comparison to our market capitalization over a reasonable period, considering historic control premiums in the financial services industry and the current market environment. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had goodwill of 423.0 million, consisting primarily of 396.1 million in our Debt Buying and Collection ("DBC") reporting unit. We performed our most recent annual review of the DBC reporting unit as of October 1, 2023, and concluded that goodwill was not impaired. 
 As of September 30, 2024 , our quarterly impairment assessment did not identify the occurrence of any triggering events, and we determined our goodwill was not more-likely-than-not impaired. However, consistent with our most recent annual review, the DBC reporting unit may be at-risk for future impairment if our cash flow projections are not met or if market factors utilized in the impairment test deteriorate, including adverse changes in the debt sales market that impact our estimated purchasing volumes and purchase price multiples, and/or an increase in the discount rate. For additional information, refer to Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates" of the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Income Taxes 
 We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in numerous international jurisdictions. The tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities. When determining our domestic and non-U.S. income tax expense, we make judgments about the application of these inherently complex laws. 
 We record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. The provision for income taxes is estimated using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. 
 We exercise significant judgment in estimating the potential exposure to unresolved tax matters and apply a more likely than not standard for recording tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions in the application of complex tax laws. While actual results could vary, we believe we have adequate tax accruals with respect to the ultimate outcome of such unresolved tax matters. We record interest and penalties related to unresolved tax matters as a component of income tax expense when the more likely than not standards are not met. 
 If all or part of the deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, we would establish a valuation allowance and charge the impact to earnings in the period such a determination is made. If we subsequently realize deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation allowance would be reversed, resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings. The establishment or release of a valuation allowance does not have an impact on cash, nor does such an allowance preclude the use of loss carryforwards or other deferred tax assets in future periods. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our results of 
 40 

operations and financial position. For further information regarding our uncertain tax positions, refer to Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2023 Form 10-K.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Our business is subject to various financial risks, including market, currency, interest rate, credit, liquidity and cash flow risk. We use various strategies, including derivative financial instruments, to manage these risks; however, they can still impact our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 We do not utilize derivative financial instruments with a level of complexity or with a risk greater than the exposure to be managed, nor do we enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Derivative instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of non-performance, or credit risk. We do not believe that we currently face a significant risk of loss in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to these instruments, as these transactions were executed with a diversified group of major financial institutions with investment-grade credit ratings. Our intention is to spread our counterparty credit risk across a number of counterparties so that exposure to a single counterparty is mitigated. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are subject to interest rate risk from borrowings on our variable rate credit facilities, as well as our interest-bearing deposits. As such, our consolidated financial results are subject to fluctuations due to changes in market interest rates. To reduce our exposure to changes in the market rate of interest, we have entered into interest rate derivative contracts to hedge a portion of our borrowings under floating rate financing arrangements. Under the terms of the interest rate derivatives, we receive a variable interest rate and pay a fixed interest rate. Of our 3.3 billion in total borrowings as of September 30, 2024, 1.1 billion was fixed rate debt. Considering these fixed rate borrowings and the interest rate hedges on our variable rate debt, with maturities ranging from three months to four years, as of September 30, 2024, 58 of our total debt was either fixed rate or converted to a fixed rate. 
 We assess interest rate risk by estimating the increase or decrease in interest expense that would occur due to a change in short-term interest rates. Borrowings on our variable rate credit facilities were 2.2 billion as of September 30, 2024, and based on our debt structure, assuming a 50 basis point decrease/increase in interest rates, interest expense over the following 12 months would decrease/increase by an estimated 7.3 million. 
 Currency Exchange Risk 
 We operate internationally and enter into transactions denominated in various foreign currencies. Our subsidiaries use multiple functional currencies, and weakness in one particular currency might be offset by strength in other currencies over time. During Q3 2024, our revenues from operations outside the U.S. were 124.0 million. 
 Fluctuations in foreign currencies could cause us to incur foreign currency gains and losses, and could affect our comprehensive income and stockholders' equity. Additionally, our reported financial results could change from period-to-period due solely to fluctuations between currencies. Foreign currency gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of transactions in other currencies into an entity's functional currency. Foreign currency gains and losses are included as a component of Other income and (expense) in our Consolidated Income Statements. From time-to-time, we may elect to enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to reduce these variations in our Consolidated Income Statements. 
 When an entity's functional currency is different than the reporting currency of its parent, foreign currency translation adjustments may occur. Foreign currency translation adjustments are included as a component of Other comprehensive income/(loss) in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and as a component of Equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 We have taken measures to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. We have organized our European operations so that portfolio ownership and collections generally occur within the same entity. Additionally, our European and UK credit facilities are multi-currency facilities, allowing us to better match funding and portfolio acquisitions by currency. We actively monitor the value of our finance receivables by currency. In the event adjustments are required to our liability composition by currency, we may, from time-to-time, execute re-balancing foreign exchange contracts to more closely align funding and portfolio acquisitions by currency.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
