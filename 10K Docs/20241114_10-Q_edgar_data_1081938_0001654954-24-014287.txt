Unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars USD ). OVERVIEW AND HISTORY CannaPharmaRX Inc. CPRX or the Company was originally incorporated in the state of Colorado in August 1998 as Network Acquisitions, Inc. and changed its name to Cavion Technologies, Inc. Cavion in February 1999. The Company focuses its business efforts on evaluation, negotiation, acquisition, and development cannabis cultivation projects in Canada. On January 6, 2022, the Company entered into a 20-year operating lease with Formosa Mountain Ltd. to lease a 55,000 square foot cannabis production facility in Cremona, Alberta, Canada. CPRX recommissioned the facility into a new indoor cannabis farm with 11 growing rooms and 10 drying and packing rooms during 2022. The Company received an operating license from Health Canada on December 9, 2022, and a cannabis license from the Canada Revenue Agency CRA on December 22, 2022. Under the new license the Company commenced cannabis production during the year ended December 31, 2023. PLAN OF OPERATION The Company received an operating license from Health Canada on December 9, 2022, and a cannabis license from the Canada Revenue Agency CRA on December 22, 2022. We anticipate developing a consistent cadence of growing, harvesting, cultivating, and delivering world class products on a regular basis and expects to begin to see a strong and accelerated revenue increase during the 2024 fiscal year FY2024 ). Our production facility is operating at maximum capacity during FY2024, achieving regular plantings with staggered production so that we are constantly harvesting and delivering high-quality products to multiple sources. Our focus continues to be on international sales with high gross margin products, resulting in greater profitability using our state-of-the-art production facility to grow on demand against purchase contracts using smart inventory management which will contribute to higher turnover and regular deliveries. We will continue to collaborate with international partners on multiple continents and develop proprietary online, data-driven technology. Our FY2024 growth goals were achieved and included delivering the first of several harvests during the first, second quarter. Additional goals for the remainder of FY2024 include continuing to increase our strategic partner network; receiving our European Union license for Good Manufacturing Practices GMP to allow us to expand distribution; expanding our customer network; becoming a world leader in unique genetic strains with a current catalogue of over 500 desirable strains developed and owned by CPRX; and continuing to improve our balance sheet. 22 Table of Contents In support of these goals: On February 16, 2024, the Company announced that we finalized a strategic supply agreement with Cantek Holdings, an Israeli corporation, whereby the Company will supply 1,000kgs of product annually. On February 23, 2024, the Company announced that we successfully obtained our Israel Medical Cannabis IMC Good Agricultural Practices GAP and Good Agricultural and Collection Practices GACP certifications. The IMC-GAP and IMC-GACP certifications are the standard for cannabis certification in Israel and are required for CPRX to sell cannabis in Israel, a world leader in the medical cannabis industry. On March 5, 2024, the Company announced that we finalized a supply agreement with ICAN Green S.A. de C.V. ICAN ), a division of ICAN Investing Group LLC to supply product for distribution in the Latin Americas with a primary focus on Mexico and Panama. The agreement is subject to certain minimum required annual levels of purchases by ICAN. On March 11, 2024, the Company shipped its first product to a Canadian LP for distribution within Canada. On March 12, 2024, the Company announced completion of its first five grows and harvests are ready for sale, with testing of the new grows underway with an independent certified laboratory to confirm that the products meet standards for distribution throughout Canada and internationally. On April 2, 2024, the Company announced repayment of its convertible notes with 1800 Diagonal Lending, LLC and Janbella Group, LLC with cash generated from debt financing with a private lender. On August 18, 2024, the Company announced that it had received three purchase orders for cannabis, for a total of 600KG, from Cantek Holdings. Recent Funding During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company: Issued 213,488 in new convertible debentures to accredited investors with immediate maturity and interest rates of 10 , and converted 62,910 of the outstanding convertible notes into Common Shares. Entered into a 100,000 note payable agreement with a private individual bearing interest at 12 per annum and maturing April 9, 2025. Entered into two additional notes payable agreements for 50,001 68,326 CAD) and 70,001 95,460 CAD), respectively, with a second private individual, each bearing interest at 10 per annum, the 50,001 note payable maturing on May 10, 2024 and the 70,001 note payable on May 31, 2024. Entered into two additional notes payable agreements for 50,000 67,320 CAD) and 50,000 68,098 CAD), respectively, with a third and fourth private individual, each bearing interest at 15 per annum, maturing on April 14, 2025 and July 29, 2025, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company issued 213,750 in new convertible debentures to accredited investors with 12-month terms to maturity and interest rates between 10 and 12 and converted 222,096 of the outstanding convertible notes into Common Shares. Going Concern Substantial doubt exists as to our ability to continue as a going concern based on the fact that we do not have adequate working capital to finance our day-to-day operations. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported 312,164 (2023 - nil) and 338,003 (2023 - nil), respectively, in revenue. The Company s deficit of 97,443,301 as at September 30, 2024 indicates substantial uncertainty about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans include engaging in further research and development and raising additional capital in the short term to fund such activities through sales of its common stock. Management s ability to implement its plans and continue as a going concern may be dependent upon raising additional capital. Our continued existence depends on the success of our efforts to raise additional capital necessary to meet our obligations as they come due and to obtain sufficient capital to execute our business plan. We may obtain capital primarily through issuances of debt or equity or entering into collaborative arrangements with corporate partners. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing additional financing or collaboration transactions or, if financing is available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, we may be required to further scale down or perhaps even cease the operation of our business. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. Our financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 23 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023 The Company has commenced actively marketing products approved by Health Canada.

The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies, defined as those policies that we believe are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Management has reviewed all other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and do not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on our financial condition or the results of our operations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to investors.

These controls are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As evidenced by our late filing of the December 31, 2023 10-K, our director and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as at December 31, 2023 at the reasonable assurance level. We have implemented new procedures for the period ended September 30, 2024 to mitigate this ineffectiveness and will continue to monitor their effectiveness. We believe that our financial statements presented in this Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for all periods presented herein. Inherent Limitations - Our management, including our Director and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdown can occur because of simple error or mistake. In particular, many of our current processes rely upon manual reviews and processes to ensure that neither human error nor system weakness has resulted in erroneous reporting of financial data. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting - Other than an emphasis on timely filing, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the period ended September 30, 2024, which were identified in conjunction with management s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 28 Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Ataraxia As part of our acquisition of AMS, we assumed an action filed against AMS by Ataraxia Canada, Inc. Ataraxia ), alleging breach of contract, specifically, breach of a non-binding term sheet providing for Ataraxia to acquire controlling interest in AMS. Ataraxia is seeking 15 million in damages. A Statement of Claim was prepared by Ataraxia, as plaintiff, and circulated to AMS, as defendant, on August 2, 2018, under the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Court file no. CV-17-580157). The parties have engaged in discussions with respect to a potential settlement of this matter. Counsel has advised that it believes it is premature to speculate on any outcome of this litigation, including the likelihood of a settlement or any potential liability at this time. Our agreement to acquire AMS contained a provision requiring us to diligently defend against the claims brought forth in, and assume full and complete control of, the Ataraxia litigation, provided that we shall not enter into any compromise or settlement in respect of the Ataraxia litigation without the prior written consent of the sellers, which consent is not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The sellers are obligated to cooperate fully and make available to us all pertinent information and witnesses under their control, make such assignments and take such other steps as in the opinion of our counsel are reasonably necessary to enable us to defend against the claims brought forth in the Ataraxia litigation. We are currently reviewing two separate situations with our legal counsel in order to ascertain whether we have claims against Steven Barber arising out of his default of the Consulting Agreement we entered into as part of the AMS acquisition more fully described in Part I, Item 1, Business, above and various claims against Gary Herick, a former officer and director. In January 2020, we received correspondence from counsel for Mr. Barber demanding payment on amounts purported to be due pursuant to his Consulting Agreement with us. We are currently reviewing whether Mr. Barber has performed pursuant to the terms of the Consulting Agreement. No decision on whether to proceed on either of these situations has been reached as at the date of this Report. BCI On April 15, 2021, Bristol Capital Investors, LLC (BCI) filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles against CannaPharmaRX Inc. and Does 1 - 50, inclusive (Case No. 21 st CV1 3696). The lawsuit alleges that CPRX breached the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Membership Purchase Agreement it had entered into with Bristol Capital Investors, LLC (BCI) to purchase BCI s interest in Ramon Road Production Campus, LLC (RRPC), a single asset entity which owned an improved property, known as the Glass House, located in Cathedral City, California. BCI alleges causes of action for Fraud, Breach of Contract, Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, and Negligent Misrepresentation, and seeks compensatory and consequential damages in the amount of 10.5 million dollars plus attorneys fees and costs. CPRX intends to vigorously defend against BCI s lawsuit, going forward. The parties conducted a court-ordered mediation, and the parties are engaging in on-going discussions. Deloitte On July 18, 2024, Deloitte LLP Deloitte filed a civil claim in the Alberta Court of Justice, alleging a breach of contract. Deloitte was engaged by CannapharmaRX to assist with fiscal year 2022 Finance Backfill and Diagnostic services and in accordance with a signed engagement letter dated August 29, 2022, proceeded to perform the professional services. Deloitte pleads that it has discharged its responsibilities and delivered its accounts to CannapharmaRX. CannapharmaRX acknowledged its satisfactory completion of services and the debts rendered but made no further payment as agreed other than an instalment payment on April 18, 2024. Deloitte is seeking recovery of the amount owing. Former executives Former executives of the company John Cassels and Andrew Steedman have filed a lawsuit against the company alleging damages and back pay due to them. The company has engaged legal counsel to resolve these matters. In the meantime, the company is working to settle the matters with both Mr. Steedman and Mr. Cassels. We are not a party to any other legal proceeding or aware of any other threatened action as at the date of this Report. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 1A.
