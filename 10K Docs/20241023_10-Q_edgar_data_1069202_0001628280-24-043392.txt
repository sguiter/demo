 We monitor our reporting units for indicators of impairment throughout the year to determine if a change in facts or circumstances warrants a re-evaluation of our goodwill.

 Our effective tax rate was for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in rate is primarily due to a discrete adjustment in the third quarter of 2023 related to the 2023 European divestiture. 
 
 We are currently under a limited scope audit by the Internal Revenue Service for our 2021 and 2022 tax years. There are also ongoing U.S. state and local audits and other foreign audits covering fiscal years 2017 through 2023. We are generally no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by taxing authorities for years prior to 2017.

 Foreign Obligations 
 
 Through several of our foreign subsidiaries, we have facilities available to assist us in financing seasonal borrowing needs for our foreign locations. We had outstanding foreign obligations as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023 and there were borrowings or repayments on these facilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Commercial Paper Program 
 
 On October 25, 2023, we established a commercial paper program (the Program ), as a replacement to our Asset Securitization Program which expired in November 2023, pursuant to which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes (the CP Notes under the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Amounts available under the Program may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed from time to time, with the aggregate face or principal amount of the CP Notes outstanding under the Program at any time not to exceed million. The CP Notes have maturities of up to days from the date of issue and rank pari passu with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The net proceeds from issuances of the CP Notes are typically used for general corporate purposes. Our revolving credit facility serves as a liquidity backstop for the repayment of CP Notes outstanding under the Program. There were CP Notes currently outstanding under the Program as of September 30, 2024. 

Credit Agreement 
 
 We have an existing billion unsecured revolving credit facility dated as of July 14, 2021 (as amended, the "Credit Agreement"), with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto. W e had outstanding borrowings and million committed to standby letters of credit as of September 30, 2024. Subject to covenant limitations, million was available for future borrowings after taking into consideration outstanding borrowings under our Program. The Credit Agreement includes a subfacility for swingline loans up to million. The Credit Agreement will expire and outstanding loans will be required to be repaid in July 2026, unless maturity is extended by the lenders pursuant to extension options that we may request under the Credit Agreement. 
 
 15 

The Credit Agreement is guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and contains customary covenants applicable to us and our subsidiaries including limitations on indebtedness, liens, dividends, stock repurchases, mergers, and sales of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant requiring us to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter for the four prior fiscal quarters, a Total Net Leverage Ratio of no more than to 1.00 (or, at our election, on up to two occasions following a material acquisition, to 1.00). 
 
 Our Credit Agreement contains customary events of default. These events of default include nonpayment of principal or other amounts, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, breach of covenants, default on certain other indebtedness or receivables securitizations (cross default), certain voluntary and involuntary bankruptcy events, and the occurrence of a change in control. A cross default under our credit facility could occur if: 
 
 We fail to pay any principal or interest when due on any other indebtedness or receivables securi tization exceeding million; or 
 
 We are in default in the performance of, or compliance with any term of any other indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount exceeding million, or any other condition exists which would give the holders the right to declare such indebtedness due and payable prior to its stated maturity. 
 
 Each of our major debt agreements contains provisions by which a default under one agreement causes a default in the others (a cross default). If a cross default under our Credit Agreement or our senior unsecured notes were to occur, it could have a wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise occur from a default of a single debt instrument or lease commitment. 
 
 If any event of default occurs and is continuing, the administrative agent, or lenders with a majority of the aggregate commitments may require the administrative agent to, terminate our right to borrow under our Credit Agreement and accelerate amounts due under our Credit Agreement (except for a bankruptcy event of default, in which case such amounts will automatically become due and payable and the lenders commitments will automatically terminate). 
 
 We are currently in compliance with all covenant requirements. 
 
 Senior Unsecured Notes 
 
 In September 2023, we issued million of senior unsecured notes, which will mature in September 2028 (the "2028 Notes") with interest being paid semi-annually in March and September at . We issued series of senior unsecured notes on July 30, 2020 for million each, which will mature on August 1, 2025 (the "2025 Notes") and August 1, 2027 (the "2027 Notes," and collectively with the 2025 Notes and the 2028 Notes, the "Notes") with interest being paid semi-annually in February and August at and respectively, per annum. 
 
 of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. All the Notes are guaranteed, on a senior unsecured basis, by certain of our subsidiaries that guarantee indebtedness under our Credit Agreement (the "Guarantor Subsidiaries"). The indenture governing the Notes contains covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of the subsidiary guarantors to: create or incur certain liens; enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; and enter into certain mergers, consolidations and transfers of substantially all of our assets. The indenture also contains a cross default provision which is triggered if we default on other debt of at least million in principal which is then accelerated, and such acceleration is not rescinded within days of the notice date. We are currently in compliance with all covenant requirements.

 We sell our products and services through a combination of direct sales, distributors and company-owned stores. The demand for our products and services is seasonal and can be significantly impacted by the weather. Warmer than normal summer temperatures generate demand for replacement air conditioning and refrigeration products and services, and colder than normal winter temperatures have a similar effect on heating products and services. Conversely, cooler than normal summers and warmer than normal winters depress the demand for HVACR products and services. In addition to weather, demand for our products and services is influenced by national and regional economic and demographic factors, such as interest rates, the availability of financing, regional population and employment trends, new construction, general economic conditions, and consumer spending habits and confidence. A substantial portion of the sales in each of our business segments is attributable to replacement business, with the balance comprised of new construction business. 
 
 The principal elements of cost of goods sold are components, raw materials, factory overhead, labor, estimated costs of warranty expense, and freight and distribution costs. The principal raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are steel, aluminum and copper. In recent years, pricing volatility for these commodities and related components has impacted us and the HVACR industry in general. We seek to mitigate the impact of certain commodity price volatility through a combination of pricing actions, vendor contracts, improved production efficiency, and cost reduction initiatives. We also partially mitigate volatility in the prices of these commodities by entering into futures contracts and fixed forward contracts.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our working capital and capital expenditure requirements are generally met through internally generated funds, bank lines of credit and a commercial paper program (as described below). Working capital needs are generally greater in the first and second quarters due to the seasonal nature of our business cycle. 
 
 Statement of Cash Flows 
 
 The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in millions):

Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities - The change in net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the net cash provided by operating activities for the same period in 2023 primarily reflects changes in working capital and an increase in net income.

 Commercial Paper Program 
 
 On October 25, 2023, we established a commercial paper program, as a replacement to our Asset Securitization Program which expired in November 2023, pursuant to which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes under the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Amounts available under the Program may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed from time to time, with the aggregate face or principal amount of the CP Notes outstanding under the Program at any time not to exceed 500.0 million. The CP Notes have maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issue and rank pari passu with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The net proceeds from issuances of the CP Notes are typically used for general corporate purposes. Our revolving credit facility serves as a liquidity backstop for the repayment of CP Notes outstanding under the Program. There are no CP Notes currently outstanding under the Program as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Credit Agreement 
 
 We have an existing 1.1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility dated as of July 14, 2021 (as amended, the "Credit Agreement"), with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto. W e had no outstanding borrowings and 1.7 million committed to standby letters of credit as of September 30, 2024. Subject to covenant 
 26 

limitations, 1,098.3 million was available for future borrowings after taking into consideration outstanding borrowings under our Program. The Credit Agreement includes a subfacility for swingline loans up to 65.0 million. The Credit Agreement will expire and outstanding loans will be required to be repaid in July 2026, unless maturity is extended by the lenders pursuant to two one-year extension options that we may request under the Credit Agreement. 
 
 Senior Unsecured Notes 
 
 In September 2023, we issued 500.0 million of senior unsecured notes, which will mature in September 2028 (the "2028 Notes") with interest being paid semi-annually in March and September at 5.50 . We issued two series of senior unsecured notes on July 30, 2020 for 300.0 million each, which will mature on August 1, 2025 (the "2025 Notes") and August 1, 2027 (the "2027 Notes," and collectively with the 2025 Notes and the 2028 Notes, the "Notes") with interest being paid semi-annually in February and August at 1.35 and 1.70 respectively, per annum. 
 
 In the event of a credit rating downgrade below investment grade resulting from a change of control, holders of our senior unsecured notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the senior unsecured notes at a repurchase price equal to 101 of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. All the Notes are guaranteed, on a senior unsecured basis, by the Guarantor Subsidiaries. The indenture governing the Notes contains covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of the Guarantor Subsidiaries to: create or incur certain liens; enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; and enter into certain mergers, consolidations and transfers of substantially all of our assets. The indenture also contains a cross default provision which is triggered if we default on other debt of at least 75.0 million in principal which is then accelerated, and such acceleration is not rescinded within 30 days of the notice date. As of September 30, 2024, we believe we were in compliance with all covenant requirements. 
 
 Financial Leverage 
 
 We periodically review our capital structure to ensure the appropriate levels of leverage and liquidity. We may access the capital markets, as necessary, based on business needs and to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions. We also evaluate our debt-to-capital and debt-to-EBITDA ratios to determine, among other considerations, the appropriate targets for capital expenditures and share repurchases under our share repurchase programs. Our debt-to-total-capital ratio decreased to 60 as of September 30, 2024 from 82 as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our senior credit ratings were Baa2 with a stable outlook, and BBB with a stable outlook, by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") and Standard Poor's Rating Group ("S P"), respectively. The security ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Our goal is to maintain investment grade ratings from Moody's and S P to help ensure the capital markets remain available to us. 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 We believe our cash and cash equivalents of 243.1 million, future cash generated from operations and available borrowing capacity are sufficient to fund operations, planned capital expenditures, future contractual obligations, potential share repurchases and dividends, and other needs in the foreseeable future. Included in our cash and cash equivalents of 243.1 million as of September 30, 2024 was 25 million of cash held in foreign locations. Our cash held in foreign locations is used for investing and operating activities in those locations, and we generally do not have the need or intent to repatriate those funds to the United States. An actual repatriation in the future from our non-U.S. subsidiaries could be subject to foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state taxes. 
 
 Guarantees Related to Our Debt Obligations 
 
 Our senior unsecured notes were issued by Lennox International Inc. ("Parent") and are unconditionally guaranteed by the Guarantor Subsidiaries. The Guarantor Subsidiaries are 100 owned and consolidated, all guarantees are full and unconditional, and all guarantees are joint and several. 
 
 The following combined Parent and Guarantor Subsidiaries financial information is presented as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 (in millions):

 Disclosure Controls and Procedures

There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
