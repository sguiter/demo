NOTE
2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 

The
Company adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method applied to all contracts not completed as of January 1, 2019. The Company
presents results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2019, under ASC 606, while prior period amounts are reported following
legacy GAAP. In addition to the above guidelines, the Company also considers implementation guidance on warranties, customer options,
licensing, and other topics. The Company considers revenue collectability, methods for measuring progress toward complete satisfaction
of a performance obligation, warranties, customer options for additional goods or services, nonrefundable upfront fees, licensing, customer
acceptance, and other relevant categories. 

The
Company accounts for a contract when the Company and the customer parties have approved the contract and are committed
to performing their respective obligations. Each party can identify its rights, obligations, and payment terms; the contract has commercial
substance. The Company will probably collect all of the consideration. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied
by transferring control of the promised service to a customer. The Company fixes the transaction price for goods and services at contract
inception. The Company s standard payment terms are generally net 30 days and, in some cases, due upon receipt of the invoice. 

The
Company considers the change in scope, price, or both as contract modifications. The parties describe contract modification as a change
order, a variation, or an amendment. A contract modification exists when the parties approve a modification that either creates new or
changes existing enforceable rights and obligations. The Company assumes a contract modification by oral agreement or implied by the
customer s customary business practice when agreed in writing. If the parties to the contract have not approved a contract modification,
the Company continues to apply the existing contract s guidance until the contract modification is approved. The Company recognizes
contract modification in various forms partial termination, an extension of the contract term with a corresponding price increase,
adding new goods or services to the contract, with or without a corresponding price change, and reducing the contract price without a
change in goods/services promised. 

At
contract inception, the Company assesses the solutions or services, or bundles of solutions and services, obligated in the contract with
a customer to identify each performance obligation within the contract and then evaluate whether the performance obligations are capable
of being distinct and distinct within the context of the agreement. Solutions and services that are not capable of being distinct and
distinct within the contract context are combined and treated as a single performance obligation in determining the allocation and recognition
of revenue. For multi-element transactions, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative
stand-alone selling price basis. The Company determines the stand-alone selling price for each item at the transaction s inception
involving these multiple elements. 

Since
January 21, 2016 Inception ), the Company has derived its revenues mainly from consulting services, technology solutions,
and customized software development. The Company recognizes revenue when it has satisfied a performance obligation by transferring control
over a product or delivering a service to a customer. We measure revenue based on the consideration outlined in an arrangement or contract
with a customer. 

NOTE

The
Company s typic The Company s typical performance obligations include the following: 

Performance

 Types
 of Deliverables 
 
 When

 Consulting Services 
 
 Consulting
 related to Start-Your-Own-Brokerage SYOB ), Start-Your-Own-Prime Brokerage SYOPB ), Start-Your-Own-Crypto
 Exchange SYOC ), FX/OTC liquidity solutions and lead generations. 
 
 The
 Company recognizes the consulting revenues when the customer receives services over the contract length. If the customer pays the
 Company in advance for these services, the Company records such payment as deferred revenue until the Company completes the services. 

Technology Services 
 
 Licensing
 of Condor Risk Management Back Office Condor Risk Management ), Condor FX Pro Trading Terminal, Condor Pricing Engine,
 Crypto Trading Platform Crypto Web Trader Platform ), and other cryptocurrency-related solutions. 
 
 The Company recognizes
 ratably over the contractual period that the services are delivered, beginning on the date such service is made available to the
 customer. Licensing agreements are typically one year in length with an option to cancel by giving notice; customers have the right
 to terminate their agreements if the Company materially breaches its obligations under the agreement. Licensing agreements do not
 provide customers the right to take possession of the software. The Company charges the customers a set-up fee for installing the
 platform, and implementation activities are insignificant and not subject to a separate fee. 

Software Development 
 
 Design and build development
 software projects for customers, where the Company develops the project to meet the design criteria and performance requirements
 as specified in the contract. 
 
 The
 Company recognizes the software development revenues when the Customer obtains control of the deliverables as stated in the Statement-of-Work
 contract. 

The
Company assumes that the goods or services promised in the existing contract will be transferred to the customer to determine the transaction
price. The Company believes that the contract will not be canceled, renewed, or modified; therefore, the transaction price includes only
those amounts to which the Company has rights under the present contract. For example, if the Company enters a contract with a customer
with an original term of one year and expects the customer to renew for a second year, the Company will determine the transaction price
based on the initial one-year period. When choosing the transaction price, the company first identifies the fixed consideration, including
non-refundable upfront payment amounts. 

To
allocate the transaction price, the Company gives an amount that best represents the consideration that the entity expects to receive
for transferring each promised good or service to the customer. The Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation
identified in the contract on a relative standalone selling price basis to meet the allocation objective. In determining the standalone
selling price, the Company uses the best evidence of the stand-alone selling price that the Company charges to similar customers in similar
circumstances. The Company sometimes uses the adjusted market assessment approach to determine the standalone selling price. It evaluates
the market in which it sells the goods or services and estimates the price that customers in that market would pay for those goods or
services when sold separately. 

The
Company recognizes revenue when or as it transfers the promised goods or services in the contract. The Company considers the transfers 
the promised goods or services when the customer obtains control of the goods or services. The Company believes a customer obtains
control of an asset when it can directly use and substantially obtain all the remaining benefits from an asset. The Company recognizes
deferred revenue related to services it will deliver within one year as a current liability. The Company presents deferred revenue related
to services that the Company will provide more than one year into the future as a non-current liability. 

According
to the contract s terms and conditions, the Company invoices the customer at the beginning of the month for the month s services.
The invoice amount is due upon receipt. The Company recognizes the revenue at the end of each month, equal to the invoice amount.

Wealth
Management 

AD
Advisory Services Pty (ADS), the Company s wealth management revenue, primarily consists of advisory revenue, commission revenue
from insurance products, fees to prepare the statement of advice, rebalancing portfolio, and other financial planning activities. ADS
is authorized and regulated by the Australian Securities Investments Commission (ASIC) to conduct licensing activities in Australia. 

ASC
606 establishes a five-step model for revenue recognition aimed at enhancing comparability and transparency across entities, industries,
and capital markets. The Company only recognizes revenue that reflects the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in exchange
for the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled. 

For
ADS, a contract is an agreement between ADS and a client that creates enforceable rights and obligations, encompassing advisory services,
insurance product commissions, and other financial planning activities. Contracts may be written, oral, or implied by customary business
practices and are identified when both parties approve the agreement; each party can identify rights regarding the goods or services
to be transferred, establish payment terms, the contract has commercial substance, and collection of payment is probable. 

A
performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the Customer. For ADS, performance obligations
may include: 

Providing ongoing financial
 advisory services, 

Preparing statements of
 advice, 

Executing portfolio rebalancing, 

Facilitating the purchase
 of insurance products, and 

Offering other specialized
 financial and estate planning services. 

We
evaluate these services to determine if they are distinct, considering whether the Customer can benefit from the service on its own or
with other resources readily available to the Customer and if the promise to transfer the service is separately identifiable from other
promises in the contract. 

The
transaction price is the amount of consideration ADS expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services
to the Customer. These services include fixed fees, commissions from insurance products, and variable consideration for performance-based
fees. ADS estimates the amount of variable consideration to which it will be entitled in a manner that reflects the likelihood and magnitude
of a revenue reversal. 

If
a contract includes more than one performance obligation, ADS allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation based on
its standalone selling price. When standalone selling prices are not directly observable, ADS estimates them using methods that may include
cost-plus margin, market assessment, or residual approach, considering the Customer s perceived value of each service. 

ADS
recognizes revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied, i.e., when the control of the promised good or service is transferred
to the Customer. For ongoing services, revenue is recognized over time, reflecting the continuous transfer of services. For services
that are performed at a specific point in time, revenue is recognized when the service is completed. The pattern of revenue recognition
is determined based on when the Customer obtains control of the promised good or service, which for advisory services is typically throughout
the contract, and for transaction-based services (like insurance commissions or fees for specific planning activities), is at the point
in time when the transaction is executed, or the service is rendered. If we receive payments before services, we defer and recognize
them as revenue when satisfied with our performance obligation. Advisory revenue includes fees charged to clients in advisory accounts
for which we are the licensed investment advisor. We bill advisory fees weekly.

with Customers. The Company primarily generates revenue through market-making and trading execution services for its clients, known as
Brokerage (Trading) revenues. The Brokerage (Trading) revenue is the Company s largest source of revenue. Brokerage (Trading) revenue

Net
interest revenue consists primarily of the revenue generated by the Company s cash and customer cash held at banks, as well as
funds on deposit as collateral with the Company s liquidity providers, less interest paid to the Company s customers. 

We
record interest revenue and interest expense when earned and incurred, respectively.

As
there is no quoted market for Series B Preferred convertible stock, and the Acquisition of of the equity of APL and of AML

Under
ASC 805-50-15-6, based on the ownership of Kundnani and the management structure post-acquisition, we believe the following guidance
in the transactions between entities under common control subsections applies to combinations between entities or businesses under common
control: 

a) 
 The Seller (APHL or Kundnani)
 transfers its controlling interest in APL and AML to the Company controlled by the Seller, directly or indirectly through his ownership
 as an individual or through APHL. This transaction is a legal organization change, but not the reporting entity. The reporting entity
 remains the Company. 

The
SEC staff s conclusions expressed during the deliberations in EITF 02-5 that common control exists between (or among) separate
entities in the following situations: An individual or enterprise holds more than 50 of the voting ownership interest of each entity.
A group of shareholders has more than 50 of the voting ownership interest of each entity, and contemporary written evidence of an agreement
to vote a majority of the entities shares in concert exists. Kundnani meets these criteria. 

We
have accounted for the Acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting per ASC 805, with the Company treated as the accounting
acquirer and Targets treated as the acquired Company for financial reporting purposes. We determine the Company an accounting
acquirer based on the following facts: (i) after the Acquisition(s), shareholders of the Company held the majority of the voting interest
of the combined Company; (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company possess majority control of the Board of Directors of the combined
Company; and (iii) members of the management of the Company are responsible for the management of the combined Company. As such, we have
treated the financial statements of the Company as the historical financial statements of the combined Company. The Company will present
consolidated or combined financial statements in place of financial statements of individual entities. 

We
have identified the Company as the legal acquirer, as it is the entity that issued securities. Comparatively, we have identified Targets
as the legal acquiree, the entity whose equity interests are acquired. 

NOTE
2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 

We
have recognized Targets assets and liabilities as their carrying amounts in the combined financial statements of the controlling
party, the Company, immediately before the Acquisition. This approach does not necessitate a fair value adjustment or a recognition of
goodwill that would typically follow a standard business combination. Therefore, we have recorded assets and liabilities at book value. 

The
transaction s equity structure involves the issuance of Series B preferred convertible stock valued at and is reflected
in the Company s equity. 

The
post-acquisition consolidation process eliminates any existing intercompany transactions or balances between the Company and Target(s).
Although the initial recognition does not adjust assets and liabilities to fair value, the Company evaluates intangible assets in Target s
financial statements on December 31, 2023.

customer accounts. The Company regularly reviews the allowance by considering historical experience, credit quality, the accounts receivable
balances age, and economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay and expected default frequency rates.
Trade receivables are written off at the point when they are considered uncollectible.

Finally, the amendments revise the guidance on calculating earnings per share, requiring the use of the if-converted method for all convertible
instruments and rescinding an entity s ability to rebut the presumption of share settlement for instruments that may be settled
in cash or other assets. The amendments are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early
adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The guidance must be adopted as of the beginning

ITEM 2. 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION
 AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

This
Quarterly Report Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those set forth as a
result of general economic conditions and changes in the assumptions used in making such forward-looking statements. The following discussion
and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the unaudited condensed financial statements
and accompanying notes and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. The analysis set forth below is provided
pursuant to applicable Securities and Exchange Commission regulations and is not intended to serve as a basis for projections of future
events. 

The
Company is building a diversified global financial services company driven by proprietary Condor trading technologies, complementary
regulatory licenses, and a proven executive team. The Company plans to acquire, integrate, transform, and scale legacy financial service
companies. The Company believes its proprietary technology and software development capabilities allow legacy financial services companies
immediate exposure to forex, stocks, ETFs, commodities, digital assets, social/copy trading, and other high-growth fintech markets. 

From
December 2021 onwards, the Company expects to grow from its acquisition strategy, specializing in buying and integrating small to mid-size
legacy financial services companies. The Company intends to build a diversified global software-driven financial services company. The
Company plans to acquire, integrate, transform, and scale legacy financial service companies. The Company replaces conventional legacy
software infrastructure with its regulatory-grade proprietary Condor trading technologies, intending to improve end-user experience,
increase client retention, and realize cost synergies. 

Currently,
we have three primary business segments: (1) Technology and Software Development, (2) Wealth Management, and (3) Investment and Margin
Brokerage Business. 

The
geopolitical situation in Eastern Europe intensified on February 24, 2022, with Russia s invasion of Ukraine. The war between the
two countries continues to evolve as military activity continues. The United States and certain European countries have imposed additional
sanctions on Russia and specific individuals. By the end of August 2022, the Company closed its technical support and development office
in Russia. We relocated our personnel to Turkey, which is currently considered a neutral zone. No individual associated with the Company
is banned or under the Special Designated Nationals and Blocked Person list. 

As
of the date of this report, there has been no disruption in our operations.

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

On
June 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had a cash balance of 31,806,857 and 31,316,461, respectively. At December 31, 2023, and 2022,
the working capital surplus was 8,854,404 and 7,460,959, respectively. The increase in the working capital surplus was mainly due to
the acquisition of AML and APL, resulting in the increase of current assets over current liabilities as of June 30, 2024. 

We
generate a substantial portion of our operating income outside the United States, which is deemed indefinitely reinvested in foreign
jurisdictions. Consequently, as outlined under Cash and Cash Equivalent, the majority of our cash and short-term investments
are held by our foreign subsidiaries. At present, we do not intend to repatriate these funds and do not foresee a need to do so. 

We
anticipate that our existing domestic cash, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our domestic
operating activities and fulfill our cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt
repayments, and capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future. 

Should
we require additional capital in the United States beyond what our domestic operations generate for instance, to fund significant
discretionary activities such as business acquisitions or share repurchases we could choose to repatriate future earnings from
foreign jurisdictions or raise capital within the United States through debt or equity issuances. These alternatives may result in higher
effective tax rates, increased interest expenses, or dilution of our earnings. We have previously borrowed funds domestically and believe
that we can continue to do so at reasonable interest rates. 

In
the next twelve (12) months, the Company will continue investing in sales, marketing, product development, new technology solutions,
and existing technology support to serve our customers. We expect capital expenditure to increase to 500,000 in the next twelve (12)
months to support the growth, including working capital, software development, sales marketing, and purchasing computers and servers. 

We
expect the combination of existing cash, cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and access to private equity and capital markets
to be sufficient for at least twelve (12) months. The availability of funds will fund our operating activities to meet the need for investing
and financing, such as debt maturities and material capital expenditures. However, we may need additional funds to achieve a sustainable
sales level to fund our ongoing operations out of revenues. There is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or,
if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us. 

Should
we require additional capital, the Company s operations are insufficient to fund its capital requirements. The Company may attempt
to restructure Notes, refinance existing Notes with financial institutions, or raise capital by selling additional capital stock or debt
issuance. The Company intends to continue growing its operations and raising funds through private equity and debt financing.

GOING
CONCERN CONSIDERATION 

We
have generated revenues of 12,505,856 and 3,246,092 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, and the recent fiscal year ended December
31, 2023. As of June 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the accumulated deficit was 2,834,639 and 2,643,647. Our independent auditors included
an explanatory paragraph in their report on the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023, and 2022 regarding
concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements contain additional note disclosures describing the
circumstances that led to this disclosure by our independent auditors. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments related
to the recoverability or classification of asset-carrying amounts or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result in
the Company being unable to continue as a going concern. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 

We
have based our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our financial statements,
which we have prepared following the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In preparing our financial statements, we must make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. 

In
more detail, we have described significant accounting policies in Note 2 of our annual financial statements included in our 10-K for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on October 15, 2024. We continuously evaluate our critical accounting estimates
and judgments required by our policies and update them as appropriate based on changing conditions. 

JOBS
Act Accounting Election 

We
are an emerging growth company , as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay
adopting new or revised accounting standards issued after the enactment of the JOBS Act until those standards apply to private companies.
As an emerging growth company, we have applied for an exemption; as a result, the Company may delay the adoption of certain accounting
standards until the standards apply to private companies. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations 

We
have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(c) of the SEC s Regulation S-B. We had no relationships
with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been
established to facilitate off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

The
amendments in the ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods therein. Early adoption
of the standard is permitted, including adoption in interim or annual periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued.
We have adopted this ASU as of March 31, 2020 for ASC 606, Revenue Recognition and Amended ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 840). The ASU is
currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. While we have described significant accounting
policies in more details in Note 2 of our annual financial statements included in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020,
filed with the SEC on April 6, 2020, we believe the accounting policies as described in Note 2 to be critical to the judgments and estimates
used in the preparation of our financial statements.

15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act, as amended. Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer, evaluated the
effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024. In making this assessment, management
used the criteria set forth by the committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control 
Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in
accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 

(1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
the assets of our company, 

(2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in
accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management
and directors, and 

(3)
provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets
that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect errors or misstatements in our consolidated
financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness in future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting of June 30, 2024. Based on our assessments, management
determined that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024, due to the material weakness
in our internal controls due to inadequate segregation of duties within account processes due to limited personnel and insufficient written
policies and procedures for accounting, IT, and financial reporting and record keeping. 

Management
intends to implement remediation steps to improve our internal controls due to inadequate segregation of duties within account processes
due to limited personnel and insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting, IT, and financial reporting and record keeping.
We plan to further improve this process by enhancing the size and composition of our board upon the closing of the business identifying
third-party professionals with whom to consult regarding complex accounting applications, and consideration of additional staff with
the requisite experience and training to supplement existing accounting professionals and implemented additional layers of reviews in
the internal controls and financial reporting process. 

This
Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm due to our status as an emerging growth
company under the JOBS Act. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph
(d) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the six months ended June 30, 2024, and 2023, that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
