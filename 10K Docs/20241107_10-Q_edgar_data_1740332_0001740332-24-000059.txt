 A R Senior Credit Facilities 
 
 On February 12, 2021, we entered into an Amendment and Restatement Agreement with JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A. as administrative agent (the A R Credit Agreement ). The A R Credit Agreement provides for an initial senior secured term B loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of million. In March 2022, we amended the agreement adding million in additional term loans with a maturity date of February 1, 2028. Additionally, in June 2024 we further amended the agreement adding million of term loans with a maturity date of May 14, 2031 to partially finance our acquisition of Snap One (the A R Term B Facility ). Included in the A R Term B Facility is a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of million (the A R Revolving Credit Facility and, together with the A R Term B Facility, the A R Senior Credit Facilities ). In June 2024, we also extended the term of our A R Revolving Credit Facility for a new term. 
 
 In May 2024, the A R Term B Facility was repriced by (i) reducing the interest rate margin from to , (ii) eliminating the SOFR credit spread adjustment, and (iii) reducing the SOFR floor from to . The repricing and incremental million issuance of term loans resulted in a loss on extinguishment of million in the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 At September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the weighted average interest rate for the A R Term B Facility, excluding the effect of the interest rate swaps, was and , respectively. There were letters of credit issued under the A R Revolving Credit Facility with outstanding borrowings. As of September 28, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants related to the A R Senior Credit Facilities. 
 
 We entered into certain interest rate swap agreements in March 2021, which were amended in June 2023 to transition from a hedge of LIBOR-based cash flows to a hedge of SOFR-based cash flows. These interest rate swap agreements effectively convert a portion of our variable-rate debt to fixed rate debt. Additionally, we acquired an interest rate cap as part of the Snap One acquisition, which caps the interest on a portion of our variable rate debt. Refer to Note 13. Derivative Financial Instruments for further discussion.

The Senior Notes due 2029 are senior unsecured obligations guaranteed by the Company s existing and future domestic subsidiaries and rank equally with all senior unsecured debt and senior to all subordinated debt. 
 
 Senior Notes due 2032 
 
 On July 17, 2024, we issued million in aggregate principal of Senior Notes due 2032 (the Senior Notes due 2032 ). The Senior Notes due 2032 are due July 15, 2032 and are senior unsecured obligations guaranteed by the Company s existing and future domestic subsidiaries. The issue price of the Senior Notes due 2032 was equal to of the principal amount. The net proceeds from the Senior Notes due 2032 were used to repay million principal amount of outstanding indebtedness under the Company s A R Term B Facility, which resulted in a loss on extinguishment of million. 
 
 We may, at our option, redeem the Senior Notes due 2032 in whole (at any time) or in part (from time to time), at varying prices based on the timing of the redemption. 
 
 The Senior Notes due 2032 limit the Company and its restricted subsidiaries ability to, among other things, incur additional non-Guarantor indebtedness and issue non-Guarantor preferred stock; enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; incur liens; and consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of their assets. Additionally, upon certain events constituting a change of control together with a ratings downgrade, the holders of the Senior Notes due 2032 have the right to require the Issuer to offer to repurchase the Senior Notes due 2032 at a purchase price equal to of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, to (but not including) the date of purchase.

 interest rate swap agreements Swap Agreements with several financial institutions for a combined notional value of million. The Swap Agreements were entered into to reduce the consolidated interest rate risk associated with variable rate, long-term debt. 
 
 During 2023, we modified the Swap Agreements blending the asset positions of the original interest rate swap agreements into new interest swap agreements and extending the term of our hedged positions. The new pay-fixed interest rate swap agreements qualify as hybrid instruments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 815, Derivatives and Hedging , consisting of financing components and embedded at-market derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedges. We also amended the Swap Agreements to transition from a hedge of LIBOR-based cash flows to a hedge of SOFR-based cash flows. 
 
 Refer to Note 12. Derivative Financial Instruments in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. 
 
 As part of our acquisition of Snap One, we acquired an interest rate cap with a notional value of million and a strike rate of , which effectively caps SOFR on the notional amount at that rate (the Interest Rate Cap ). We are required to pay a premium of million at the maturity date of December 31, 2025. The Interest Rate Cap qualifies as a hybrid instrument consisting of a financing component and an embedded at-market derivative that was designated as a cash flow hedge on our A R Term B Facility as of the Snap One acquisition date. 
 
 The Swap Agreements and Interest Rate Cap (referred to collectively as interest rate derivatives are adjusted to fair value on a quarterly basis.

 Reimbursement Agreement 
 
 We separated from Honeywell International Inc. Honeywell on October 29, 2018, becoming an independent publicly traded company as a result of a pro rata distribution of our common stock to shareholders of Honeywell (the Spin-off ). In connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into a reimbursement agreement, pursuant to which we have an obligation to make cash payments to Honeywell in amounts equal to of payments for certain Honeywell environmental-liability payments (the Reimbursement Agreement ), which include amounts billed (payments), less of Honeywell s net insurance receipts relating to such liabilities, and less of the net proceeds received by Honeywell in connection with (i) affirmative claims relating to such liabilities, (ii) contributions by other parties relating to such liabilities and (iii) certain property sales (the recoveries). The Reimbursement Agreement extends until the earlier of (1) December 31, 2043; or (2) December 31 of the third consecutive anniversary where the annual reimbursement obligation (including accrued amounts) has been less than million. While the amount payable by us in respect of such liabilities arising in any given year is subject to a cap of million under the Reimbursement Agreement, the estimated liability for resolution of pending and

 For the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, net expenses related to the Reimbursement Agreement were million and million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, net expenses related to the Reimbursement Agreement were million and million, respectively. 
 
 We do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of indemnification liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies, litigation or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with such indemnification liability payments can be determined although they could be material to our consolidated results of operations and operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. 
 
 Independent of our payments under the Reimbursement Agreement, we will have ongoing liability for certain environmental claims, which are part of our ongoing business. 
 
 Other Matters 
 
 We are subject to lawsuits, investigations and disputes arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability, acquisitions and divestitures, employee matters, intellectual property, and environmental, health, and safety matters. We recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. We continually assess the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes in these matters, as well as potential ranges of possible losses, based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance

 Overview and Business Trends 
 
 We are a leading global manufacturer and distributor of technology-driven sensing and controls products and solutions that help homeowners and businesses stay connected and in control of their comfort, security and energy use. We are a leader in the home heating, ventilation and air conditioning controls markets, smoke and carbon monoxide detection home safety and fire suppression products, and security markets. We have a global footprint serving commercial and residential end-markets. We manage our business operations through two operating segments, Products and Solutions and ADI Global Distribution. The Products and Solutions operating segment, consistent with our industry, has a higher gross and operating profit profile in comparison to the ADI Global Distribution operating segment. In the second quarter of 2024, we expanded the business through the acquisition of Snap One, which has been incorporated into the ADI Global Distribution segment. The acquisition expands our distribution into and reach with smart-living products, services, and software. 
 
 Our Products and Solutions operating segment offerings include temperature and humidity control, energy products and solutions, water and air solutions, smoke and carbon monoxide detection home safety products, security panels, sensors, peripherals, communications devices, video cameras, other home-related lifestyle convenience solutions, cloud infrastructure, installation and maintenance tools, and related software. 
 Our ADI Global Distribution business is a leading wholesale distributor of low-voltage security products including access control, fire detection, fire suppression, security, and video products and participates significantly in the broader related markets of audio, communications, data communications, networking, power, residential and professional audio-visual solutions, smart-living, software solutions, and wire and cable. Our ADI Global Distribution strategy is focused on growth in our omni-channel presence, expansion into adjacent markets, and continued enhancements to our value-add services to support our professional installers efficiency and profitability. 
 Our financial performance is influenced by macroeconomic factors underlying end user demand such as repair and remodeling activity, residential and non-residential construction, new and existing home sales, employment rates, interest rates and bank lending standards, and supply chain dynamics that can be influenced by geopolitics. The ongoing uncertainty and volatility in the global macroeconomic conditions have affected and could continue to affect our visibility toward future performance. While supply chain and logistics continue to normalize over 2024, customer demand continues to moderate as uncertainties remain including the potential for changes in inflation and interest rates, increased labor costs, reduced consumer spending due to softening labor markets, elevated mortgage rates, unfavorable foreign currency impacts from a stronger U.S. dollar, shift to cleaner energy, and potential market and other disruption from the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine as well as the Middle East crisis. 
 
 Current Period Highlights

Outlook 
 
 For the fourth quarter of 2024, we anticipate executing our business against a mixed global macro-economic environment. There are a number of positive indicators, such as an improving interest rate environment and an uptick in new home sales in the United States. There are, however, some negative indicators, such as continued softness in existing home sales in the United States and market weakness in EMEA.

 Nine months ended 
 
 Corporate costs for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 were 141 million and 101 million for the comparable period. The increase in Corporate costs was driven by 32 million of Snap One acquisition costs, 7 million of debt extinguishment costs, and a 5 million impairment of an equity security. These increases are partially offset by lower personnel expenses of 4 million. 

Capital Resources and Liquidity 
 
 As of September 28, 2024, total cash and cash equivalents were 531 million, of which 44 were held by foreign subsidiaries. Our liquidity is primarily dependent on our ability to continue to generate positive cash flows from operations, supplemented by external sources of capital, as needed. Additional liquidity may also be provided through access to the capital markets and our 500 million A R Revolving Credit Facility. 
 
 In June 2024, we completed the acquisition of Snap One. This was partially financed with 600 million in incremental term loans under our A R Term B Facility, with a maturity date of May 14, 2031. Additionally, we issued Preferred Stock on 
 34 

Table of Contents 

 June 14, 2024 for 500 million to partially finance the Snap One acquisition. The remainder of the cash purchase price was financed with our existing cash. 
 
 In July 2024, we issued 600 million in aggregate principal of 6.500 Notes due 2032. The Senior Notes due 2032 were used to repay 596 million principal amount outstanding indebtedness under the Company s A R Term B Facility. 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of sales growth, market acceptance of our products, the timing and extent of research and development projects, potential acquisitions of companies or technologies and the expansion of our sales and marketing activities. We may enter into acquisitions or strategic arrangements in the future, which also could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. While we may elect to seek additional funding at any time, we believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and availability under our credit facilities are sufficient to meet our capital requirements through at least the next 12 months and the longer term. 
 
 We may from time to time take steps to reduce our debt or otherwise improve our financial position. These actions could include prepayments, open market debt repurchases, negotiated repurchases, other redemptions or retirements of outstanding debt, opportunistic refinancing of debt, raising additional capital or divesting certain assets. The amount of prepayments or the amount of debt that may be refinanced, repurchased or otherwise retired, if any, will depend on market conditions, trading levels of our debt, our cash position, compliance with debt covenants and other considerations. 
 
 Credit Agreement 
 
 As of September 28, 2024, we had 1,989 million of net long-term debt outstanding under our A R Credit Agreement, Senior Notes due 2029, and Senior Notes due 2032, of which 6 million is due in the next 12 months. We have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert a portion of our variable-rate debt to fixed-rate debt. Additionally, as part of our acquisition of Snap One, we acquired an interest rate cap with a notional of 345 million and a strike rate of 4.79 , which effectively caps SOFR on the notional amount at that rate. 
 
 In June 2024, we obtained 600 million in incremental term loans under our A R Term B Facility to partially finance our acquisition of Snap One. We also extended the term of our A R Revolving Credit Facility for a new five-year term. 
 
 In July 2024, we issued 600 million in aggregate principal of 6.500 Senior Notes due 2032. The Senior Notes due 2032 were used to repay 596 million principal amount outstanding indebtedness under the Company s A R Term B Facility. 
 
 Refer to Note 12. Long-Term Debt and Note 13. Derivative Financial Instruments to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our debt obligations and the timing of future principal and interest payments, including impacts from our Swap Agreements. 
 
 Common Share Repurchase Program 
 
 On August 3, 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to 150 million of our common stock over an unlimited time period. During the three months ended September 28, 2024, we did not make any common share repurchases. As of September 28, 2024, we had 108 million of authorized repurchases remaining under the Share Repurchase Program.

 Cash Flow Summary for the Nine Months Ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 
 Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, as reflected in the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements, are summarized as follows: 
 
 Nine Months Ended (in millions) September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 change Cash provided by (used for): Operating activities 241 177 64 Investing activities (1,386) (90) (1,296) Financing activities 1,043 (47) 1,090 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (3) 1 (4) Net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (105) 41 (146) 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 was 241 million. Compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities increased 64 million. The increase was primarily driven by improved working capital dynamics and cash earnings. 
 
 Net cash used for investing activities for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 was 1,386 million. Compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used for investing activities increased 1,296 million, primarily due to an increase in cash used for acquisitions of 1,318 million mainly related to the Snap One acquisition offset by favorable changes in capital expenditures of 16 million and 6 million of favorable changes in other investing activities, including proceeds from sales of assets. 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 was 1,043 million. Compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used for financing activities increased 1,090 million, primarily due to an increase of 1,176 million incremental term loan borrowings under our A R Term B Facility, and the issuance of Preferred Stock in the amount of 482 million, each related to the Snap One acquisition. This increase was partially offset by an increase in debt repayments of 593 million as well as a decrease in common stock repurchases of 27 million. 
 
 Contractual Obligations and Probable Liability Payments 
 
 In addition to our long-term debt discussed above, our material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations. 
 
 Reimbursement Agreement Payments 
 
 In connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into the Reimbursement Agreement with Honeywell. As of September 28, 2024, a liability of 682 million was deemed probable and reasonably estimable; however, it is possible we could pay 140 million per year (exclusive of any late payment fees up to 5 per annum) until the earlier of: (1) December 31, 2043; or (2) December 31 of the third consecutive year during which the annual reimbursement obligation (including in respect of deferred payment amounts) has been less than 25 million. During the nine months ended September 28, 2024, we paid Honeywell 105 million under the Reimbursement Agreement. For further discussion on the Reimbursement Agreement, refer to Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Environmental Liability Payments 
 
 We make environmental liability payments for sites which we own and are directly responsible. As of September 28, 2024, a liability of 22 million was deemed probable and reasonably estimable.

 Operating Leases 
 
 We have operating lease arrangements for the majority of our manufacturing sites, offices, engineering and lab sites, stocking locations, warehouses, automobiles, and certain equipment. As of September 28, 2024, we had operating lease payment obligations of 238 million, with 50 million payable within 12 months.

 Refer to Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 We are exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, commodity price risk and interest rates, which could affect operating results, financial position and cash flows. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 As of September 28, 2024, the Swap Agreements, with a notional value of 560 million, effectively convert a portion of our 1,118 million long-term variable rate A R Term B Facility to fixed rate debt. The Swap Agreements effectively convert a portion of our variable interest rate obligations to a rate based on Term SOFR with a minimum rate of 0.39 per annum to a base fixed weighted average rate of 1.13 over the remaining terms. 
 
 As part of our acquisition of Snap One in the second quarter of 2024, we assumed an interest rate cap agreement with a notional of 345 million and a strike rate of 4.79 . 
 
 As of September 28, 2024, an increase in interest rates by 100 bps would have an approximately 2 million impact on our annual interest expense. 
 
 For more information on the Swap Agreements and acquired interest rate cap, refer to Note 13. Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 14. Fair Value to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 
 We are exposed to market risks from changes in currency exchange rates. While we primarily transact with customers and suppliers in the U.S. dollar, we also transact in foreign currencies, primarily including the British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Mexican Peso, Indian Rupee, Euro, and the Polish Zloty. These exposures may impact total assets, liabilities, future earnings and/or operating cash flows. Our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates results from transactions arising out of international trade, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, and international financing activities between subsidiaries. We rely primarily on natural offsets to address our exposures and may supplement this approach from time to time by entering into forward and option hedging contracts. As of September 28, 2024, we have no outstanding foreign currency hedging arrangements. 
 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 
 While we are exposed to commodity price risk, we attempt to pass through significant changes in component and raw material costs to our customers based on the contractual terms of our arrangements. In limited situations, we may not be fully compensated for such changes in costs.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures designed to give reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 
 Management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Because there are inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud have been or will be detected. 
 
 Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with the assistance of other members of our management, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based upon such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 On June 14, 2024 we acquired 100 of the issued and outstanding equity of Snap One. We are currently integrating Snap One into our internal controls over financial reporting. Except for the inclusion of Snap One, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 28, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. Other Information 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 
 Refer to Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report for a discussion on legal proceedings. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 We face a variety of risks that are inherent in our business and our industry, including operational, legal and regulatory risks. Such risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, expectations and historical trends. There have been no material changes to the risk factors described in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, except as reflected in the first three revised risk factors below and the three additional risk factors that follow. 
 
 Revised Risk Factors: 
 
 We may from time to time pursue acquisitions. Our business may be adversely affected if we cannot consummate acquisitions on satisfactory terms, or if we cannot effectively integrate acquired companies or assets. 
 
 We have in the past and may from time to time in the future continue to pursue and consummate acquisitions of companies or assets. Our ability to consummate any future acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates to purchase or may be unable to acquire on economically acceptable terms or to receive necessary regulatory approvals or support. 
 
 38 

Table of Contents 

 The consummation of any particular acquisition may depend, in part, on our ability to raise the capital necessary to fund such acquisition which may not be available to us at all or on economically advantageous terms. In addition, if we consummate an acquisition, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly. Future acquisitions could result in gross and/or operating income dilution, the incurring of additional debt or equity issuances and contingent liabilities and an increase in interest and amortization expenses or periodic impairment expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets and significant charges relating to integration costs. 
 
 For example, we acquired the Snap One business in June 2024 and we are in the early stages of integrating this business into our ADI Global Distribution segment. The acquisition is highly complementary to our prior ADI Global Distribution business and, therefore, is subject to many of the same risks that impact our ADI Global Distribution business, in addition to a few risks specific to Snap One. The Snap One business relies on independent integrators who are certified and trained in the Control4 proprietary smart living solutions to sell and install its solutions for end users and, therefore, is more reliant on these integrators to market, sell, install and support Snap One solutions. In addition, because many of the Snap One solutions are designed to interoperate with a wide range of third-party products that we do not own or control, it is important that we support the continued integration of these solutions with third-party products and applications. The Snap One business also relies heavily on suppliers and manufacturing facilities located in China, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia, increasing our exposure to potential political and trade instability and tension. The success of the acquisition will depend on our ability to integrate the business and also manage these additional risks. 
 
 We may not be successful in effectively identifying all risks of an acquired business, integrating the acquired business or technology into our existing business or realizing the benefits expected at acquisition. Our due diligence may fail to identify all of the liabilities or challenges of an acquired business, product, software, service or technology, including issues related to intellectual property, product quality or product or software architecture, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices or employee, customer or supplier issues. We may not be able to achieve the expected operational synergies or savings nor, or any growth targets identified in acquisition diligence. The successful integration of future acquisitions may also require substantial attention from our senior management and the management of the acquired business, which could decrease the time that they have to manage our existing portfolio, attract customers and develop new products and services or attend to other acquisition opportunities. 
 
 We rely on a dependable IT infrastructure and network operations that have adequate cybersecurity functionality. 
 
 The efficient operation of our business requires substantial investment in technology infrastructure systems, including enterprise resource planning systems, information systems, supply chain management systems, digital commerce systems and connected solutions platforms and network operations and systems. The failure to acquire, implement, maintain and upgrade as required these systems may impact our ability to respond effectively to changing customer expectations, manage our business, scale our solutions effectively or impact our customer service levels, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage and negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In connection with our recent acquisition of the Snap One business, we are in the process of consolidating and integrating our ADI and Snap One enterprise applications. We may not be able to successfully implement or consolidate all systems without delays related to resource constraints or challenges with the critical implementation process. Repeated or prolonged interruptions of service, due to cyber threats or problems with our systems or third-party technologies, whether or not in our control, could have a significant negative impact on our reputation and our ability to sell products and services. Furthermore, we may incur higher than anticipated costs in connection with our system implementation, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected if our information systems fail, become unavailable for prolonged periods of time, are corrupted or do not allow us to transmit accurate information. Failure to properly or adequately address these issues, including the failure to fund backups, upgrades and improvements to our systems, could impact our ability to perform necessary business operations, which could adversely affect our reputation, competitive position, business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our ability to keep our business operating is highly dependent on the proper and efficient operation of our data centers, networks, and data backup systems. In addition, a significant portion of our employees are engaged in remote or hybrid work from their homes, which further exposes our information technology IT systems to potential cyber interference and disruption of work activities based on availability and performance of internet access in the regions in which our employees reside.

 Risks Relating to Our Common Stock and the Securities Market 
 
 Our stock price has been volatile; stockholder s percentage ownership in our Company may be diluted in the future. 
 
 The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future. The market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by the following factors: actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results; changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our failure to perform in line with such estimates; announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, divestitures, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; the loss of, or decrease in sales to, one or more key customers; global macroeconomic conditions; and departures of key personnel. 
 
 A stockholder s percentage ownership in our Company may be diluted in the future because of common stock-based equity awards that we have granted and expect to grant in the future in accordance with our 2018 Stock Incentive Plan for the benefit of certain employees and other service providers, as well as our equity plan for our non-employee directors. In addition, we may issue additional equity as necessary to finance our ongoing operations and future acquisitions. 
 
 In addition, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation our Certificate authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock, which may have preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and distributions, as our Board may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. See The preferred stock issued in connection with the Snap One transaction has rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to, the rights of our common stock and has reduced the relative voting power of the holders of our common stock. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences that we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock. 
 
 New Risk Factors: 
 
 The preferred stock issued in connection with the Snap One transaction has rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to, the rights of our common stock and has reduced the relative voting power of the holders of our common stock. 
 
 In June 2024, we issued 500,000 shares of Series A Cumulative Convertible Participating Preferred Stock, par value 0.01 per share (the Preferred Stock ), to CD R Channel Holdings, L.P. (the CD R Stockholder ), an entity affiliated with the investment firm Clayton, Dubilier Rice LLC, pursuant to an Investment Agreement dated April 14, 2024 (the Investment Agreement ). The proceeds of the issuance were used to partially finance the Snap One transaction. The Preferred Stock is convertible perpetual participating preferred stock of Resideo, with an initial conversion price of 26.92 per share, and accrues dividends at a rate of 7.0 per annum (payable in cash or in-kind, at the option of Resideo), with the potential for the dividend rate to increase to 10 under specified circumstances. Moreover, if we declare or pay a cash dividend on our common stock, we will be required to declare and pay a dividend on the outstanding Preferred Stock on a pro rata basis with the common shares determined on an as-converted basis at the time the dividend is declared. 
 
 The Preferred Stock may initially be converted at any time at the option of the holder into 18,573,551 shares of our common stock. In addition, under the terms of the Preferred Stock, we may, at our option, force the conversion of all (but not less than all) of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock to common stock if at any time the market price of our common stock exceeds 200 of the then-effective conversion price per share for at least 20 days out of any trailing 30-trading day period. Any conversion of the Preferred Stock may significantly dilute the holders of our common stock. Unless we obtain shareholder approval, the maximum number of shares of common stock into which the Preferred Stock may be converted will be limited such that, upon any conversion of Preferred Stock, the number of shares of our common stock being issued upon conversion will not cause the holder thereof, when taken together with all other shares of our common stock beneficially owned by such holder at the time of conversion, to beneficially own shares of our common stock exceeding 19.9 of the total voting power of our common stock (on an as-converted basis), subject to the maximum number of shares of our common stock that may then be issued in such conversion being in accordance with the listing requirements of the NYSE absent the receipt of stockholder approval . 
 
 The conversion price of the Preferred Stock is subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, including in the event of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or similar event. In addition, holders of Preferred Stock have the right to receive a liquidation preference entitling them to be paid out of our assets available for distribution to shareholders, before any 
 40 

Table of Contents 

 payment may be made to the holders of shares of common stock, an amount equal to the greater of (a) 100 of the liquidation preference thereof plus all accrued and unpaid dividends or (b) the amount that such holder would have been entitled to receive upon our liquidation, dissolution and winding up if all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock had been converted into common stock immediately prior to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up, without regard to any of the limitations on conversion or convertibility. Furthermore, upon the consummation of a change of control transaction, Resideo has the right to redeem the shares of Preferred Stock at a redemption price equal to 150 of the original purchase price of the Preferred Stock plus all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon. 
 
 The CD R Stockholder holds a significant equity interest in our business and may exercise influence over us, including through their ability to designate up to two directors to our board of directors, and its interests as a preferred equity holder may diverge from, or even conflict with, the interests of our other holders of our common stock. 
 
 As of June 29, 2024, the CD R Stockholder beneficially owns shares of our common stock and Preferred Stock, which, taken together on an as-converted basis, represent approximately 11 of our total voting power. As a result, the CD R Stockholder may have the indirect ability to influence our policies and operations. In addition, under the Investment Agreement, the CD R Stockholder is entitled to appoint up to two directors to our board of directors, subject to specified minimum ownership requirements. Both Nathan K. Sleeper and John Stroup, partners at CD R, currently serve as directors. With such representation on our board of directors, the CD R Stockholder has influence over the appointment of management and any action requiring the vote of our board of directors, including significant corporate action such as mergers and sales of substantially all of our assets. Additionally, for so long as the CD R Stockholder owns Preferred Stock, certain matters will require the approval of the CD R Stockholder, including: (1) amendments to our certificate of incorporation, the certificate of designations for the Preferred Stock or our bylaws that would alter or change the terms or the powers, preferences, rights or privileges of the Preferred Stock as to affect them adversely; (2) authorizing, creating, increasing the authorized amount of, or issuing any class or series of equity securities that rank senior to or on party with the Preferred Stock; (3) increasing or decreasing the authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock; (4) amending certain debt financing documents to include limitations on our ability to accrue dividends on the Preferred Stock that are more restrictive in any material respect than those set forth in our existing debt financing documents; or (5) adopting any plan of liquidation or filing any voluntary petition for bankruptcy, receivership or any similar proceeding. The CD R Stockholder and its affiliates are in the business of making or advising on investments in companies, including businesses that may directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business. In addition, the CD R Stockholder may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their overall equity investment and have a negative impact to holders of our common stock as a whole. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 
 During the three months ended September 28, 2024, we did not make any common share repurchases. As of September 28, 2024, we had approximately 108 million of authorized repurchases remaining under the Share Repurchase Program. 

Item 5. Other Information. 
 
 During the three months ended September 28, 2024, no director or officer of the Company , modified or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
