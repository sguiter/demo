 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDIN G FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. You can identify these statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as may, will, should, expect, anticipate, project, target, estimate, intend, continue or believe or the negatives of, or other variations on, these terms or comparable terminology. You should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss our plans, strategies, prospects and expectations concerning our business, operating results, financial condition and other similar matters. We believe that it is important to communicate our future expectations to our investors. Our forward-looking statements include information in this report regarding general domestic and global economic conditions, our future financing plans, our ability to operate as a business development company BDC and the expected performance of, and the yield on, our portfolio companies. There may be events in the future, however, that we are not able to predict accurately or control. The factors listed under Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as well as any cautionary language in this report, provide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward-looking statements. The occurrence of the events described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this report could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this report speaks only as of the date of this report. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. You are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we have filed or in the future may file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), including annual reports on Form 10-K, registration statements on Form N-2, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The safe harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), which preclude civil liability for certain forward-looking statements, do not apply to the forward-looking statements in this quarterly report, because we are an investment company. The following factors are among those that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements: 
 our future operating results; 

disruptions in the capital markets, market conditions, and general economic uncertainty; 

changes in political, economic, social or industry conditions, the interest rate environment or conditions affecting the financial and capital markets, including the effect of any pandemic or epidemic; 

uncertainty surrounding the financial and political stability of the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and China, the war between Russia and Ukraine and the escalated conflict in the Middle East; 

our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies; 

the impact of investments that we expect to make; 

the impact of increased competition; 

our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 

the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its impact on the industries in which we invest; 

the ability of our current and prospective portfolio companies to achieve their objectives; 

the relative and absolute performance of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. (the "Investment Adviser"); 

the use of borrowed money to finance a portion of our investments; 

our ability to make distributions; 

the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital; 

changes in interest rates; 

the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio companies;

our ability to maintain our status as a BDC; 

our ability to maintain our status under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code as a regulated investment company RIC and our qualification for tax treatment as a RIC; 

actual and potential conflicts of interest with the Investment Adviser and its affiliates; 

the ability of the Investment Adviser to attract and retain highly talented professionals; 

the impact on our business from new or amended legislation or regulations; 

the availability of credit and/or our ability to access the equity and capital markets; 

currency fluctuations, particularly to the extent that we receive payments denominated in foreign currency rather than U.S. dollars; 

the impact of changing inflation and interest rates and the risk of recession on our portfolio companies; 

the impact of the 2024 U.S. presidential election; 

the effect of global climate change on our portfolio companies; 

the impact of interruptions in the supply chain on our portfolio companies;

For the avoidance of doubt, the Management Fee for the Company's first quarter (i.e., the period beginning on the Initial Drawdown Date and ending on the last day of the quarter in which the Initial Drawdown Date occurred) will be equal to (i.e., an annual rate of of the Company's average gross assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts) at the end of such quarter. The Management Fee for any partial quarter will be appropriately prorated. The Investment Adviser waives a portion of its management fee payable by the Company in an amount equal to the management fees it earns as an investment adviser for any affiliated money market funds in which the Company invests. Following the occurrence (if any) of a listing, the Management Fee will be equal to (i.e., an annual rate of of the average of the values of the Company's gross assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts) at the end of each of the two most recently completed calendar quarters (and, in the case of the Company's first quarter-end following any listing, the Company's gross assets as of such quarter-end).

Incentive Fee Pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement, the Company pays to the Investment Adviser an incentive fee (the Incentive Fee as follows: The Incentive Fee consists of components that are determined independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. A portion of the Incentive Fee is based on income and a portion is based on capital gains, each as described below.

 . For this purpose, the hurdle is computed by reference to the Company s NAV and does not take into account any changes in the market price of the Company s common stock. The Incentive Fee based on income will be determined and paid quarterly in arrears at the end of each calendar quarter by reference to the Company s aggregate net investment income, as adjusted as described below, from the calendar quarter then ending and the eleven preceding calendar quarters or if shorter, the number of quarters that have occurred since the Initial Drawdown Date (in either case, the Trailing Twelve Quarters ). However, following the occurrence (if any) of a listing, the Trailing Twelve Quarters will be reset so as to include, as of the end of any quarter, the calendar quarter then ending and the eleven preceding calendar quarters (or if shorter, the number of quarters that have occurred since the listing, rather than the number of quarters that have occurred since the Initial Drawdown Date). The hurdle amount for the Incentive Fee based on income is determined on a quarterly basis, and is equal to multiplied by the Company s NAV at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. The hurdle amount is calculated after making appropriate adjustments for subscriptions (which shall include all issuances by the Company of shares of its common stock) and distributions that occurred during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. The Incentive Fee for any partial period will be appropriately prorated. For the portion of the Incentive Fee based on income, the Company pays the Investment Adviser a quarterly Incentive Fee based on the amount by which (A) Ordinary Income in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters exceeds (B) the hurdle amount for such Trailing Twelve Quarters. The amount of the excess of (A) over (B) described in this paragraph for such Trailing Twelve Quarters is referred to as the Excess Income Amount. The Incentive Fee based on income for each quarter is determined as follows: Incentive Fee based on income is payable to the Investment Adviser for any calendar quarter for which there is no Excess Income Amount; 

 of the Ordinary Income (as defined below), if any, that exceeds the hurdle amount, but is less than or equal to an amount, which we refer to as the Catch-up Amount, determined as the sum of (or in the event of a listing) multiplied by the Company s NAV at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter included in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters is included in the calculation of the Incentive Fee based on income; and 

 (which will be increased to in the event of a listing, from the date of such listing) of the Ordinary Income that exceeds the Catch-up Amount is included in the calculation of the Incentive Fee based on income. 

 The amount of the Incentive Fee based on income that will be paid to the Investment Adviser for a particular quarter will equal the excess of the Incentive Fee so calculated minus the aggregate Incentive Fees based on income that were paid in respect of the first eleven calendar quarters (or the portion thereof) included in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters but will not exceed the Incentive Fee Cap (as described below, and subject to the limitations set forth in Section 205(b)(3) of the Advisers Act). The Incentive Fee based on income that is paid to the Investment Adviser for a particular quarter is subject to a cap (the Incentive Fee Cap ). The Incentive Fee Cap for any quarter is an amount equal to (a) (which will be increased to in the event of a listing, from the date of such listing) of the Cumulative Net Return (as defined below) during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters minus (b) the aggregate Incentive Fees based on income that were paid in respect of the first eleven calendar quarters (or the portion thereof) included in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. Ordinary Income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any accrued income that we have not yet received in cash and any other fees such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter minus our operating expenses accrued during the calendar quarter (including the Management Fee, administrative expenses and any interest expense and dividends paid on issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the Incentive Fee). Cumulative Net Return means (x) the Ordinary Income in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters minus (y) any Net Capital Loss (as defined below), if any, in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value, the Company will pay no Incentive Fee based on income to the Investment Adviser for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is a positive value but is less than the Incentive Fee based on income that is payable to the Investment Adviser for such quarter (before giving effect to the Incentive Fee Cap) calculated as described above, the Company will pay an Incentive Fee based on income to the Investment Adviser equal to the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is equal to or greater than the Incentive Fee based on income that is payable to the Investment Adviser for such quarter (before giving effect to the Incentive Fee Cap) calculated as described above, the Company will pay an Incentive Fee based on income to the Investment Adviser equal to the Incentive Fee calculated as described above for such quarter without regard to the Incentive Fee Cap. In certain limited circumstances, an Incentive Fee based on income will be payable to the Investment Adviser although the net income for such quarter did not exceed the hurdle rate or the Incentive Fee will be higher than it would have been if calculated based on the Company s performance for the applicable quarter without taking into account the Trailing Twelve Quarters. Net Capital Loss in respect of a particular period means the difference, if positive, between (i) aggregate capital losses, whether realized or unrealized, in such period and (ii) aggregate capital gains, whether realized or unrealized, in such period.

 and . As of September 30, 2024, remained payable. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, Incentive Fees based on income amounted to and . ii. Annual Incentive Fee Based on Capital Gains The portion of Incentive Fee based on capital gains is determined and paid annually in arrears at the end of each calendar year or, in the event of a listing, the date on which such event occurs. At the end of each calendar year (or the occurrence of a listing), the Company will pay the Investment Adviser an Incentive Fee equal to (A) (which will be increased to in the event of a listing, from the date of such listing) of the difference, if positive, of the sum of the Company s aggregate realized capital gains, if any, computed net of the Company s aggregate realized capital losses, if any, and the Company s aggregate unrealized capital depreciation, in each case from the Initial Drawdown Date (or, following the occurrence (if any) of a listing, from the date on which such event occurs) until the end of such calendar year or listing, as applicable, minus (B) the cumulative amount of Incentive Fees based on capital gains previously paid to the Investment Adviser from the Initial Drawdown Date (or, following the occurrence (if any) of a listing, from the date on which such event occurs) through the end of such calendar ye ar or listing, as applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, unrealized capital appreciation is excluded from the calculation in clause (A), above. The Company accrues, but does not pay, a portion of the Incentive Fee based on capital gains with respect to net unrealized appreciation. Under GAAP, the Company is required to accrue an Incentive Fee base d on capital gains that includes net realized capital gains and losses and net unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation on investments held at the end of each period. In calculating the accrual for the Incentive Fee based on capital gains, the Company considers the cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation in the calculation, since an Incentive Fee based on capital gains would be payable if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the Investment Management Agreement. This accrual is calculated using the aggregate cumulative realized capital gains and losses and aggregate cumulative unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. If such amount is positive at the end of a period, then the Company records a capital gains incentive fee equal to (which will be increased to in the event of a listing, from the date of such listing) of such amount, minus the aggregate amount of actual Incentive Fees based on capital gains paid in all prior periods (or, following the occurrence (if any) of a listing, in all prior periods beginning with the date on which such event occurs). If such amount is negative, then there is no accrual for such period. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company accrued Incentive Fees based on capital gains under GAAP of and , which were not realized.

The Company pays the Administrator fees for its services as it determines to be commercially reasonable in its sole discretion. The Company also reimburses the Administrator for all reasonable expenses. To the extent that the Administrator outsources any of its functions, the Administrator pays any compensation associated with such functions.

Due to Affiliates The Investment Adviser pays certain general and administrative expenses, including legal expenses, on behalf of the Company in the ordinary course of business. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were and , respectively, included within Accrued expenses and other liabilities that were paid by the Investment Adviser and its affiliates on behalf of the Company. Co-Investment Activity In certain circumstances, the Company can make negotiated co-investments pursuant to an exemptive order from the SEC permitting it to do so. On November 16, 2022, the SEC granted to the Investment Adviser, the BDCs advised by the Investment Adviser and certain other affiliated applicants exemptive relief on which the Company expects to rely to co-invest alongside certain other client accounts managed by the Investment Adviser (collectively with the Company, the Accounts ), which may include proprietary accounts of Goldman Sachs, in a manner consistent with the Company's investment objectives and strategies, certain Board-established criteria, the conditions of such exemptive relief and other pertinent factors (as amended, the Relief ). On June 25, 2024, the SEC granted an amendment to the Relief, which permits the Company to participate in follow-on investments in the Company s existing portfolio companies with certain affiliates covered by the Relief if such affiliates, that are not BDCs or registered investment companies, have an investment in such existing portfolio company. Additionally, if the Investment Adviser forms other funds in the future, the Company may co-invest alongside such other affiliates, subject to compliance with the Relief, applicable regulations and regulatory guidance, as well as applicable allocation procedures. As a result of the Relief, there could be significant overlap in the Company s investment portfolio and the investment portfolios of other Accounts, including, in some cases, proprietary accounts of Goldman Sachs. The Goldman Sachs Asset Management Private Credit Team is composed of investment professionals dedicated to the Company s investment strategy and to other funds that share a similar investment strategy with the Company. The Goldman Sachs Asset Management Private Credit Team is responsible for identifying investment opportunities, conducting research and due diligence on prospective investments, negotiating and structuring the Company s investments, and monitoring and servicing the Company s investments. The team works together with investment professionals who are primarily focused on investment strategies in syndicated, liquid credit. Under the terms of the Relief a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the Investment Company Act) of the Company s independent directors must make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the proposed transaction are reasonable and fair to the Company and the Company s stockholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of the Company or its stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of the Company s stockholders and is consistent with the then-current investment objectives and strategies of the Company.

Please see Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with this discussion and analysis. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward-looking information due to factors discussed under Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements appearing elsewhere in this report. 
 OVERVIEW 
 We are a specialty finance company focused on lending to middle-market companies. We are a closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment Company Act"). In addition, we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company RIC ), and we expect to qualify annually for tax treatment as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2021. From our commencement of investment operations on October 29, 2021 through September 30, 2024, we have originated approximately 1,207.13 million in aggregate principal amount of debt and equity investments prior to any subsequent exits and repayments. We seek to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation primarily through direct originations of secured debt, including first lien, unitranche debt, including last-out portions of such loans, and second lien debt, and unsecured debt, including mezzanine debt, as well as through select equity investments. 
 Unitranche loans are first lien loans that extend deeper in a borrower s capital structure than traditional first lien debt and may provide for a waterfall of cash flow priority between different lenders in such loan. In a number of instances, we may find another lender to provide the first-out portion of a unitranche loan while we retain the last-out portion of such loan, in which case, the first-out portion of the loan would generally receive priority with respect to the payment of principal, interest and any other amounts due thereunder as compared to the last-out portion that we would continue to hold. In exchange for taking greater risk of loss, the last-out portion generally earns a higher interest rate than the first-out portion of the loan. We use the term mezzanine to refer to debt that ranks senior in right of payment only to a borrower s equity securities and ranks junior in right of payment to all of such borrower s other indebtedness. We may make multiple investments in the same portfolio company. 
 We may also originate covenant-lite loans, which are loans with fewer financial maintenance covenants than other obligations, or no financial maintenance covenants. Such covenant-lite loans may not include terms that allow the lender to monitor the performance of the borrower or to declare a default if certain criteria are breached. These flexible covenants (or the absence of covenants) could permit borrowers to experience a significant downturn in their results of operations without triggering any default that would permit holders of their debt (such as us) to accelerate indebtedness or negotiate terms and pricing. In the event of default, covenant-lite loans may recover less value than traditional loans as the lender may not have an opportunity to negotiate with the borrower prior to such default. 
 We expect to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80 of our net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes), directly or indirectly in private middle-market credit obligations and related instruments. We define credit obligations and related instruments for this purpose as any fixed-income instrument, including loans to, and bonds and preferred stock of, portfolio companies and other instruments that provide exposure to such fixed-income instruments. Middle market is used to refer to companies with between 5 million and 200 million of annual earnings before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization EBITDA excluding certain one-time and non-recurring items that are outside the operations of these companies. While, as a result of fluctuations in the net-asset value of one asset relative to other assets, private middle-market credit obligations and related instruments may represent less than 80 of our net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) at any time, we may not invest, under normal circumstances, more than 20 of our net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in securities and other instruments that are not private middle-market credit obligations and related instruments. To the extent we determine to invest indirectly in private middle-market credit obligations and related instruments, we may invest through certain synthetic instruments, including derivatives that have similar economic characteristics to private middle-market credit obligations. For purposes of determining compliance with our 80 policy, each applicable derivative instrument will be valued based upon its market value. We will notify our stockholders at least 60 days prior to any change to the 80 investment policy described above. 
 We expect to directly or indirectly invest at least 70 of our total assets in middle-market companies domiciled in the United States. However, we may from time to time invest opportunistically in large U.S. companies, non-U.S. companies, stressed or distressed debt, structured products, private equity or other opportunities, subject to limits imposed by the Investment Company Act.

Table of Contents 

 While our investment program is expected to focus primarily on debt investments, our investments may include equity features, such as a direct investment in the equity or convertible securities of a portfolio company or warrants or options to buy a minority interest in a portfolio company. Any warrants we may receive with debt securities will generally require only a nominal cost to exercise, so as a portfolio company appreciates in value, we may achieve additional investment return from these equity investments. We may structure the warrants to provide provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest holder, as well as puts, or rights to sell such securities back to the portfolio company, upon the occurrence of specified events. In many cases, we may also obtain registration rights in connection with these equity investments, which may include demand and piggyback registration rights. 
 For a discussion of the competitive landscape we face, please see Item 1A. Risk Factors Competition We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities and Item 1. Business Competitive Advantages in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 KEY COMPONENTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Investments 
 Our level of investment activity can and will vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment, the amount of capital we have available to us and the competitive environment for the type of investments we make. 
 As a BDC, we may not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets specified in the Investment Company Act, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70 of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in eligible portfolio companies. Pursuant to rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), eligible portfolio companies include certain companies that do not have any securities listed on a national securities exchange and public companies whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange but whose market capitalization is less than 250 million. 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenues in the form of interest income on debt investments and, to a lesser extent, capital gains and distributions, if any, on equity securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Some of our investments may provide for deferred interest payments or payment-in-kind PIK income. The principal amount of the debt investments and any accrued but unpaid interest generally becomes due at the maturity date. 
 We generate revenues primarily through receipt of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, structuring, syndication, exit fees or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. Portfolio company fees (directors fees, consulting fees, administrative fees, tax advisory fees and other similar compensation) will be paid to us, unless, to the extent required by applicable law or exemptive relief, if any, therefrom, we receive our allocable portion of such fees when invested in the same portfolio company as other client accounts managed by our Investment Adviser (collectively with the Company, the "Accounts"), which other Accounts could receive their allocable portion of such fee. We do not expect to receive material fee income as it is not our principal investment strategy. We record contractual prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income. 
 Dividend income on preferred equity investments is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity investments is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies and on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Interest and dividend income are presented net of withholding tax, if any.

 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of the management fee (the Management Fee and the incentive fee (the Incentive Fee to our Investment Adviser, legal and professional fees, interest and other debt expenses and other operating and overhead related expenses. The Management Fee and Incentive Fee compensate our Investment Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing and monitoring our investments. We bear all other expenses of our operations and transactions in accordance with the investment management agreement (the Investment Management Agreement and administration agreement (the Administration Agreement ), including: 
 our operational, offering and organizational expenses; 

fees and expenses, including travel expenses, incurred by our Investment Adviser or payable to third parties related to our investments, including, among others, professional fees (including the fees of consultants and experts) and fees and expenses from evaluating, monitoring, researching and performing due diligence on investments and prospective investments; 

interest payable on debt, if any, incurred to finance our investments; 

fees and expenses incurred by us in connection with membership in investment company organizations; 

brokers commissions; 

fees and expenses associated with calculating our NAV (including expenses of any Independent Valuation Advisor); 

legal, auditing or accounting expenses; 

taxes or governmental fees; 

the fees and expenses of our Administrator, transfer agent and/or sub-transfer agent; 

the cost of preparing stock certificates or any other expenses, including clerical expenses of issue, redemption or repurchase of the shares;

In addition, we shall bear the fees and expenses related to the preparation and maintaining of any necessary registrations with regulators in order to market the common stock of the Company in certain jurisdictions and fees and expenses associated with preparation and maintenance of any key information document or similar document required by law or regulation. 
 Our Investment Adviser will not be required to pay expenses of activities, which are primarily intended to result in sales of common stock, including all costs and expenses associated with the preparation and distribution of the Subscription Agreements. 
 We expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or decline as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset growth and to increase during periods of asset declines. 
 Leverage 
 We expect from time to time to borrow funds for a variety of purposes, subject to the limitations of the Investment Company Act, including to bridge fundings for investments in advance of drawdowns, as part of our investment strategy, to meet other short-term liquidity needs, including to pay the Management Fee, and to facilitate our hedging activities. Sources of leverage include the issuance of senior securities (including preferred stock) and other credit facilities (secured by investments and/or pledges of Undrawn Commitments). 
 Our revolving credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the BoA Revolving Credit Facility ), and our revolving credit agreement with Truist Bank, as administrative agent (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the "Truist Revolving Credit Facility" and together with the BoA Revolving Credit Facility, the "Revolving Credit Facilities"), allow us to borrow money and lever our investment portfolio, subject to the limitations of the Investment Company Act, with the objective of increasing our yield. This is known as leverage and could increase or decrease returns to our stockholders. The use of leverage involves significant risks. We are permitted to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the Investment Company Act, is at least 150 after such borrowing (if certain requirements are met).

Table of Contents 

 Certain trading practices and investments, such as reverse repurchase agreements, may be considered borrowings or involve leverage and thus may be subject to Investment Company Act restrictions. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered borrowings for these purposes. Practices and investments that may involve leverage but are not considered borrowings are not subject to the Investment Company Act s asset coverage requirement. The amount of leverage that we employ will depend on the assessment by our Investment Adviser and our board of directors (the Board of Directors or the Board of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing.

 (3) For a particular portfolio company, we calculate the level of contractual indebtedness net of cash net debt owed by the portfolio company and compare that amount to measures of cash flow available to service the net debt. To calculate net debt, we include debt that is both senior and pari passu to the tranche of debt owned by us but exclude debt that is legally and contractually subordinated in ranking to the debt owned by us. We believe this calculation method assists in describing the risk of our portfolio investments, as it takes into consideration contractual rights of repayment of the tranche of debt owned by us relative to other senior and junior creditors of a portfolio company. We typically calculate cash flow available for debt service at a portfolio company by taking EBITDA for the trailing twelve-month period. Weighted average net debt to EBITDA is weighted based on the fair value of our debt investments, excluding investments where net debt to EBITDA may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk, such as cash collateralized loans and investments that are underwritten and covenanted based on recurring revenue. 

For a particular portfolio company, we also calculate the level of contractual interest expense owed by the portfolio company and compare that amount to EBITDA interest coverage ratio ). We believe this calculation method assists in describing the risk of our portfolio investments, as it takes into consideration contractual interest obligations of the portfolio company. Weighted average interest coverage is weighted based on the fair value of our performing debt investments, excluding investments where interest coverage may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk, such as cash collateralized loans and investments that are underwritten and covenanted based on recurring revenue. 
 
 Median EBITDA is based on our debt investments, excluding investments where net debt to EBITDA may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk, such as cash collateralized loans and investments that are underwritten and covenanted based on recurring revenue. 
 
 Portfolio company statistics are derived from the most recently available financial statements of each portfolio company as of the reported end date. Statistics of the portfolio companies have not been independently verified by us and may reflect a normalized or adjusted amount. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, investments where net debt to EBITDA may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk represented 22.7 and 35.1 of total debt investments at fair value. 
 Our Investment Adviser monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company on an ongoing basis to determine each is meeting its respective business plan and to assess the appropriate course of action for each portfolio company. Our Investment Adviser has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include: (i) assessment of success in adhering to the portfolio company s business plan and compliance with covenants; (ii) periodic or regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; (iii) comparisons to our other portfolio companies in the industry, if any; (iv) attendance at and participation in Board meetings or presentations by portfolio companies; and (v) review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections of portfolio companies. 
 As part of the monitoring process, our Investment Adviser also employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our Investment Adviser grades the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 4 no less frequently than quarterly. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also take into account under certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. The grading system for our investments is as follows: 
 	 Grade 1 investments involve the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis. The trends and risk factors for this investment since origination or acquisition are generally favorable, which may include the performance of the portfolio company or a potential exit; 
 	 Grade 2 investments involve a level of risk to our initial cost basis that is similar to the risk to our initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition. This portfolio company is generally performing as expected and the risk factors to our ability to ultimately recoup the cost of our investment are neutral to favorable. All investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially assessed a grade of 2; 
 	 Grade 3 investments indicate that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has increased materially since origination or acquisition, including as a result of factors such as declining performance and non-compliance with debt covenants; however, payments are generally not more than 120 days past due; and 
 	 Grade 4 investments indicate that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has substantially increased since origination or acquisition, and the portfolio company likely has materially declining performance. For debt investments with an investment grade of 4, in most cases, most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. For investments graded 4, it is anticipated that we will not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a substantial loss of our initial cost basis upon exit.

 Our Investment Adviser grades the investments in our portfolio at least quarterly and it is possible that the grade of a portfolio investment may be reduced or increased over time. For investments graded 3 or 4, the Investment Adviser enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company.

The increase in investments with a grade 1 investment performance rating was driven by an investment with an aggregate fair value of 2.30 million being upgraded from a grade 2 investment performance rating to a grade 1 investment performance rating due to a potential repayment. The decrease in investment with a grade 4 investment performance rating was primarily driven by an investment with fair market value of 0.48 million, as of September 30, 2024, being upgraded to grade 3 from grade 4 performance ratings due to restructuring.

Investments are placed on non-accrual status when it is probable that principal, interest or dividends will not be collected according to the contractual terms. Accrued interest or dividends generally are reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Interest or dividend payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment. Non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest or dividends are paid and, in management s judgment, principal and interest or dividend payments are likely to remain current. We may make exceptions to this treatment if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 The primary use of existing funds and any funds raised in the future is expected to be for our investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to, or stock repurchases from, our stockholders or for other general corporate purposes, including paying for operating expenses or debt service to the extent we borrow or issue senior securities. 
 
 We expect to generate cash primarily from the net proceeds of any future offerings of securities, drawdowns of capital commitments, future borrowings and cash flows from operations. To the extent we determine that additional capital would allow us to take advantage of additional investment opportunities, if the market for debt financing presents attractively priced debt financing opportunities, or if our Board of Directors otherwise determines that leveraging our portfolio would be in our best interest and the best interests of our stockholders, we may enter into credit facilities in addition to the Revolving Credit Facilities, or issue other senior securities. We would expect any such credit facilities may be secured by certain of our assets and may contain advance rates based upon pledged collateral. The pricing and other terms of any such facilities would depend upon market conditions when we enter into any such facilities as well as the performance of our business, among other factors. As a BDC, with certain limited exceptions, we are only permitted to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the Investment Company Act, is at least 150 after such borrowing (if certain requirements are met). See Key Components of Operations Leverage. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our asset coverage ratio based on the aggregate amount outstanding of our senior securities (which includes our Revolving Credit Facilities) was 217 and 219 . We may also refinance or repay any of our indebtedness at any time based on our financial condition and market conditions. 
 We may enter into investment commitments through signed commitment letters that may ultimately become investment transactions in the future. We regularly evaluate and carefully consider our unfunded commitments using GSAM s proprietary risk management framework for the purpose of planning our capital resources and ongoing liquidity, including our financial leverage. 
 An affiliate of the Investment Adviser made a capital commitment to us of 100 on October 29, 2021 (commencement of operations) and served as our initial member (the Initial Member ). We cancelled the Initial Member s interest in us on November 23, 2021, the first date on which investors (other than the Initial Member) made their initial capital contribution to purchase shares of our common stock (the Initial Drawdown Date ). We began accepting subscription agreements Subscription Agreements from investors acquiring common shares in our private offering. Under the terms of the Subscription Agreements, investors are required to make capital contributions up to the amount of their undrawn capital commitment to purchase shares each time we deliver a drawdown notice. 
 As of the dates indicated, we had aggregate capital commitments and undrawn capital commitments from investors as follows:

 Contractual Obligations 
 We have entered into certain contracts under which we have future commitments. Payments under the Investment Management Agreement, pursuant to which GSAM has agreed to serve as our Investment Adviser, are equal to (1) a percentage of value of our average gross assets and (2) a two-part Incentive Fee. Under the Administration Agreement, pursuant to which State Street Bank and Trust Company has agreed to furnish us with the administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations, we pay State Street Bank and Trust Company (the Administrator such fees as may be agreed between us and our Administrator that we determine are commercially reasonable in our sole discretion. Either party or the stockholders, by a vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, may terminate the Investment Management Agreement without penalty on at least 60 days written notice to the other party. Either party may terminate the Administration Agreement without penalty upon at least 30 days written notice to the other party.

(1) We may borrow amounts in USD or certain other permitted currencies. Debt outstanding denominated in currencies other than USD has been converted to USD using the applicable foreign currency exchange rate as of the applicable reporting date. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding borrowings denominated in U.S. Dollars (" " or "USD") of 341.00 million, in Great British Pounds ("GBP") of GBP 15.37 million, in Canadian Dollars ("CAD") of CAD 39.75 million, and in Euros ("EUR") of EUR 3.44 million. 

BoA Revolving Credit Facility 
 We entered into the BoA Revolving Credit Facility on November 26, 2021 with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (the Administrative Agent ), lead arranger, letter of credit issuer and a lender. We amended the BoA Revolving Credit Facility on July 26, 2022, November 14, 2022 and November 9, 2023. 
 Subject to availability under the Borrowing Base (as defined by the BoA Revolving Credit Facility), the maximum principal amount of the BoA Revolving Credit Facility was 95 million as of September 30, 2024. The Borrowing Base is calculated based on the unfunded capital commitments of the investors meeting various eligibility requirements (subject to investor concentration limits) multiplied by specified advance rates. The stated maturity date of the BoA Revolving Credit Facility is May 24, 2024, subject to one option to extend the stated maturity date to November 22, 2024, upon the satisfaction of certain customary conditions. On April 26, 2024, we exercised our option to extend the stated maturity date to November 22, 2024 and satisfied the applicable customary conditions. 
 Under the BoA Revolving Credit Facility, we have the ability to elect Daily Simple SOFR, Term SOFR, the applicable alternative currency rate, or the alternate base rate at the time of drawdown, and loans may be converted from one rate to another at any time, subject to certain conditions. The interest rate on obligations under the BoA Revolving Credit Facility is (A) the prevailing Daily Simple SOFR, Term SOFR for the applicable interest period or the applicable alternative currency rate, in each case, plus any applicable credit spread adjustment (which is zero for Daily Simple SOFR and 1-month Term SOFR), plus 2.95 per annum, or (B) an alternate base rate (the greatest of (i) the Prime Rate plus 1.95 per annum, (ii) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50 plus 1.95 per annum, and (iii) Term SOFR with a one-month tenor plus 1.00 ). We pay (x) a 0.35 annualized fee if the facility utilization is equal to or greater than 50 of the maximum commitment and (y) a 0.45 annualized fee if the facility utilization is less than 50 of the maximum commitment, in each case, on a quarterly basis on committed but undrawn amounts under the BoA Revolving Credit Facility. 
 For further details, see Note 6 Debt BoA Revolving Credit Facility to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.

 Truist Revolving Credit Facility 
 We entered into the Truist Revolving Credit Facility on February 28, 2023 with, among others, Truist Bank, as administrative agent, lead arranger, letter of credit issuer and lender, which has been amended and supplemented from time to time. 
 The Truist Revolving Credit Facility is a multicurrency facility, and as of September 30, 2024, total outstanding revolving commitments under the Truist Revolving Credit Facility were 530 million and term loans under the Truist Revolving Credit Facility were 25 million for an aggregate amount of 555 million. The Truist Revolving Credit Facility also has an accordion feature, subject to the satisfaction of various conditions, which could bring total commitments under the Truist Revolving Credit Facility to 750 million. Commitments under the Truist Revolving Credit Facility may be repaid and reborrowed until the end of the revolving availability period, which ends on May 30, 2028. Any amounts borrowed under the Truist Revolving Credit Facility will mature, and all accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable, on May 30, 2029. 
 Borrowings denominated in USD, including amounts drawn in respect of letters of credit, bear interest (at our election) of either (i) Term SOFR plus a margin of either 2.00 or 1.75 (subject to certain gross borrowing base conditions), plus an additional 0.10 credit adjustment spread, or (ii) an alternate base rate, which is the highest of (x) Prime Rate in effect on such day, (y) Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day plus 1/2 of 1.00 and (z) Term SOFR for an interest period of one (1) month plus 1.00 , plus a margin of either 1.00 or 0.75 (subject to certain gross borrowing base conditions). Borrowings denominated in non-USD bear interest of the applicable term benchmark rate or daily simple RFR plus a margin of either 2.00 or 1.75 (subject to certain gross borrowing base conditions), plus, in the case of borrowings denominated in Pound Sterling (GBP) only, an additional 0.0326 credit adjustment spread or 0.1193 credit adjustment spread, for 1-month tenor and 3-months tenor borrowings, respectively. With respect to borrowings denominated in USD, we may elect either Term SOFR, or an alternative base rate at the time of borrowing, and such borrowings may be converted from one benchmark to another at any time, subject to certain conditions. 
 For further details, see Note 6 Debt Truist Revolving Credit Facility to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We may become a party to investment commitments and to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of our business to fund investments and to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2024, we believed that we had adequate financial resources to satisfy our unfunded commitments. Our unfunded commitments to provide funds to portfolio companies were as follows:

HEDGING 
 Subject to applicable provisions of the Investment Company Act and applicable Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC") regulations, we may enter into hedging transactions in a manner consistent with SEC guidance. To the extent that any of our loans are denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, we may enter into currency hedging contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We may also enter into interest rate hedging agreements. Such hedging activities, which will be subject to compliance with applicable legal requirements, may include the use of futures, options, swaps and forward contracts. Costs incurred in entering into such contracts or in settling them, if any, will be borne by us. Our Investment Adviser has claimed no-action relief from CFTC registration and regulation as a commodity pool operator pursuant to a CFTC Rule 4.5 with respect to our operations, with the result that we will be limited in our ability to use futures contracts or options on futures contracts or engage in swap transactions. Specifically, CFTC Rule 4.5 imposes strict limitations on using such derivatives other than for hedging purposes, whereby the use of derivatives not used solely for hedging purposes is generally limited to situations where (i) the aggregate initial margin and premiums required to establish such positions does not exceed five percent of the liquidation value of our portfolio, after taking into account unrealized profits and unrealized losses on any such contracts it has entered into; or (ii) the aggregate net notional value of such derivatives does not exceed 100 of the liquidation value of our portfolio. Moreover, we anticipate entering into transactions involving such derivatives to a very limited extent solely for hedging purposes or otherwise within the limitations of CFTC Rule 4.5. 
 50 

Table of Contents 

 Rule 18f-4 under the Investment Company Act includes limitations on the ability of a BDC (or a RIC) to use derivatives and other transactions that create future payment or delivery obligations (including reverse repurchase agreements and similar financing transactions). Under the rule, BDCs that make significant use of derivatives are subject to a value-at-risk leverage limit, a derivatives risk management program, testing requirements and requirements related to board reporting. These new requirements apply unless the BDC qualifies as a limited derivatives user, as defined in Rule 18f-4. Under the rule, a BDC may enter into an unfunded commitment agreement that is not a derivatives transaction, such as an agreement to provide financing to a portfolio company, if the BDC has, among other things, a reasonable belief, at the time it enters into such an agreement, that it will have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet its obligations with respect to all of its unfunded commitment agreements, in each case as it becomes due. Under Rule 18f-4, when we trade reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions, including certain tender option bonds, we need to aggregate the amount of any other senior securities representing indebtedness (e.g., bank borrowings, if applicable) when calculating our asset coverage ratio. We currently operate as a limited derivatives user and these requirements may limit our ability to use derivatives and/or enter into certain other financial contracts. 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ materially. 
 For a description of our critical accounting policies, see Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. We consider the most significant accounting policies to be those related to our Investments, Revenue Recognition, Non-Accrual Investments, Distributions, and Income Taxes. We consider the most significant critical estimate to be the fair value measurement of investments. The critical accounting policies and estimate should be read in connection with our risk factors listed under Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Fair Value Measurement of Investments 
 Consistent with GAAP and the Investment Company Act, we conduct a valuation of our investments, pursuant to which our NAV is determined. Our investments are valued on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if required under the Investment Company Act. The determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. The majority of investments are not quoted or traded in an active market and as such their fair values are determined using valuation techniques, primarily discounted cash flows, market multiples, and recent comparable transactions. The most significant inputs in applying the discounted cash flow approach and the market multiples approach are the selected discount rates and multiples, respectively. The selection of these inputs is based on a combination of factors that are specific to the underlying portfolio companies such as financial performance and certain factors that are observable in the market such as current interest rates and comparable public company trading multiples. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of these valuations and any change in these valuations on the consolidated financial statements. For further details of our investments and fair value measurement accounting policy, see Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies Investments and Note 5 Fair Value Measurement. 
 
 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
 On October 11, 2024, we exercised our right pursuant to the Truist Credit Facility to request a commitment increase, with the aggregate amount of revolving commitments under the Truist Revolving Credit Facility increasing from 530,000 to 555,000. 
 On November 7, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a distribution equal to an amount up to our taxable earnings per share, including net investment income (if positive) for the period October 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024, payable on or about January 28, 2025 to shareholders of record as of December 31, 2024. 
 ITEM 3.	 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are subject to financial market risks, most significantly changes in interest rates. Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in our earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we expect to fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is expected to be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, we can offer no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, on a fair value basis, 100 of our performing debt investments bore interest at a floating rate. Our borrowings under the BoA Revolving Credit Facility and the Truist Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a floating rate. 
 We regularly measure our exposure to interest rate risk. We assess interest rate risk and manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities.

We may, in the future, hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act, applicable CFTC regulations and in a manner consistent with SEC guidance. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments with fixed interest rates. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . As of the end of the period covered by this report, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time, we may be a party to certain legal proceedings, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under loans to or other contracts with our portfolio companies. We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against us.

The Administrative Agent shall determine the Exchange Rate for any Foreign Currency as of each Revaluation Date to be used for calculating the Dollar Equivalent amounts of Loans, Letters of Credit and Revolving Credit Exposure denominated in such Foreign Currency. Such Exchange Rate shall become effective as of such Revaluation Date and shall be the Exchange Rate employed in converting any amounts between the applicable currencies until the next Revaluation Date to occur. Except for purposes of financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 5.01 or except as otherwise provided herein, the applicable amount of any currency (other than Dollars) for purposes of the Loan Documents shall be such Dollar Equivalent amount as so determined by the Administrative Agent.

If the basis of accrual of interest or fees expressed in this Agreement with respect to an Agreed Foreign Currency of any country that becomes a Participating Member State after the date on which such currency becomes an Agreed Foreign Currency shall be inconsistent with any convention or practice in the interbank market for the basis of accrual of interest or fees in respect of the Euro, such convention or practice shall replace such expressed basis effective as of and from the date on which such state becomes a Participating Member State; provided that, with respect to any Borrowing denominated in such currency that is outstanding immediately prior to such date, such replacement shall take effect at the end of the Interest Period therefor. 
 Without prejudice to the respective liabilities of the Borrower to the Lenders and the Lenders to the Borrower under or pursuant to this Agreement, each provision of this Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as the Administrative Agent may from time to time, in consultation with the Borrower, reasonably specify to be necessary or appropriate to reflect the introduction or changeover to the Euro in any country that becomes a Participating Member State after the Effective Date; provided that the Administrative Agent shall provide the Borrower and the Lenders with prior notice of the proposed change with an explanation of such change in sufficient time to permit the Borrower and the Lenders an opportunity to respond to such proposed change.

 SECTION 1.09.	 Letter of Credit Amounts . Unless otherwise specified herein, the amount of a Letter of Credit at any time shall be the amount of such Letter of Credit available to be drawn at such time; provided that with respect to any Letter of Credit that, by its terms, provides for one or more automatic (subject only to the passage of time) increases in the available amount thereof prior to the earlier of the then-applicable expiration date of such Letter of Credit (without giving effect to any renewal or extension) and twelve (12) months after the later of the (i) initial date of issuance of such Letter of Credit and (ii) most recent date of renewal or extension of such Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be the maximum amount of such Letter of Credit after giving effect to all such increases, whether or not such maximum amount is available to be drawn at such time.

Such notice to the Administrative Agent shall specify the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans in which the applicable Lenders will participate. Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent will give notice thereof to each Dollar Lender or Multicurrency Lender, as applicable, specifying in such notice such Lender s Applicable Dollar Percentage or Applicable Multicurrency Percentage, as applicable, of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above in this paragraph, to pay to the Administrative Agent, for account of any applicable Swingline Lender, such Lender s Applicable Dollar Percentage or Applicable Multicurrency Percentage, as applicable, of the applicable Swingline Loan or Loans made under such Lender s Class of Commitments.

The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the Borrower of any default in the payment thereof. 
 (d)	 Replacement of Any Swingline Lender . Any Swingline Lender may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Swingline Lender and the successor Swingline Lender.

After the replacement or resignation of a Swingline Lender hereunder, the replaced or resigning Swingline Lender shall have no obligation to make additional Swingline Loans. 
 (e)	 Designation of Additional Swingline Lenders .

 (e)	 Participations . By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) by an Issuing Bank, and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Banks or the Lenders, (i) in the case of a Multicurrency Issuing Bank, such Multicurrency Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Multicurrency Lender, and each Multicurrency Lender hereby acquires from such Multicurrency Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender s Applicable Multicurrency Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit and (ii) in the case of a Dollar Issuing Bank, such Dollar Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Dollar Lender, and each Dollar Lender hereby acquires from such Dollar Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender s Applicable Dollar Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit.

 In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, (x) each Multicurrency Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Multicurrency Issuing Bank, such Lender s Applicable Multicurrency Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by each such Multicurrency Issuing Bank and (y) each Dollar Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Dollar Issuing Bank, such Lender s Applicable Dollar Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by each such Dollar Issuing Bank, in each case, in respect of Letters of Credit promptly upon the request of each such Issuing Bank (which such request shall be made by such Issuing Bank in accordance with the notice requirements applicable to the Borrower with respect to a request for Loans in Section 2.03) at any time from the time of such LC Disbursement until such LC Disbursement is reimbursed by the Borrower or at any time after any reimbursement payment is required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. Such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each such payment shall be made in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis , to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to such Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.05(f), the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the applicable Issuing Bank or, to the extent that the Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and such Issuing Banks as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement. 

751446606 754747243 
 66 

(f)	 Reimbursement . If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such Issuing Bank in respect of such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on (i) the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice of such LC Disbursement, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time, provided that, if such LC Disbursement is not less than 250,000 (or such smaller amount as may be agreed to by the Administrative Agent) and is denominated in Dollars, the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.04 that such payment be financed with an ABR Borrowing or a Swingline Loan of the respective Class in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrower s obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Borrowing or Swingline Loan. 
 If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each affected Revolving Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Revolving Lender s Applicable Multicurrency Percentage or Applicable Dollar Percentage, as applicable, thereof. 
 (g)	 Obligations Absolute . The Borrower s obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (f) of this Section 2.05 shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by an Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply strictly with the terms of such Letter of Credit, and (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section 2.05, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of the Borrower s obligations hereunder. 
 None of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Issuing Banks, or any of their respective Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit by the Issuing Banks or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Banks; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse any Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by any Issuing Bank s fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof as determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. The parties hereto expressly agree that: 

751446606 754747243 
 67 

(i)	the Issuing Banks may accept documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and may make payment upon presentation of documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit; 
 (ii)	the Issuing Banks shall have the right, in their sole discretion, to decline to accept such documents and to make such payment if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit; and 
 (iii)	this sentence shall establish the standard of care to be exercised by the Issuing Banks when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof (and the parties hereto hereby waive, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any standard of care inconsistent with the foregoing). 
 (h)	 Disbursement Procedures . Each Issuing Bank shall, within a reasonable time following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. Each Issuing Bank shall promptly after such examination notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy or electronic communication) of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank and the applicable Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement. 
 (i)	 Interim Interest . If any Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Loans; provided that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement within two (2) Business Days following the date when due pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Section 2.05, then the provisions of Section 2.12(d) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Section 2.05 to reimburse an Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment. 
 (j)	 Resignation or Replacement of an Issuing Bank . Any Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. In addition, any Issuing Bank may resign as an Issuing Bank hereunder upon not less than three (3) Business Days prior written notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower; provided further that if any Issuing Bank, in its capacity as a Lender, assigns all of its Loans and Commitments in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have automatically resigned as an Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement or resignation of an Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement or resignation shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced or resigning Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.11(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) 

751446606 754747243 
 68 

the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the replaced Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term Issuing Bank and/or Issuing Banks shall be deemed to refer to such successor or successors (and the other current Issuing Banks, if applicable) or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor or successors (and all other current Issuing Banks) and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement or resignation of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced or resigning Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement or resignation, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit. 
 (k)	 Designation of Additional Issuing Banks . The Borrower may, at any time and from time to time, with the consent of the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), designate as additional Issuing Banks one (1) or more Lenders that agree to serve in such capacity as provided below. The acceptance by a Lender of an appointment as an Issuing Bank hereunder shall be evidenced by an agreement, which shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and such designated Lender and, from and after the effective date of such agreement, (i) such Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and (ii) references herein or therein to the term Issuing Bank shall be deemed to include such Lender in its capacity as an issuer of Letters of Credit hereunder. 
 (l)	 Cash Collateralization . If the Borrower shall be required to provide cover for LC Exposure of a Class pursuant to Section 2.09(a), Section 2.10(c), Section 2.10(d), Section 2.18(c)(ii) or the last paragraph of Section 7.01, the Borrower shall immediately (or in accordance with the time periods specified in the applicable section) deposit into a segregated collateral account or accounts (herein, collectively, the Letter of Credit Collateral Account in the name and under the dominion and control of the Administrative Agent, Cash denominated in the Currency of the Letter of Credit under which such LC Exposure arises in an amount equal to the amount required under Section 2.09(a), Section 2.10(c), Section 2.10(d), Section 2.18(c)(ii) or the last paragraph of Section 7.01, as applicable. Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral in the first instance for the LC Exposure under this Agreement and thereafter for the payment of the Secured Obligations, and for these purposes the Borrower hereby grants a security interest to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account and in any financial assets (as defined in the Uniform Commercial Code) or other property held therein. If the Borrower is required to provide cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such cash collateral (to the extent not applied as set forth in this Section 2.05(l)) shall be returned to the Borrower within three (3) Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived. If the Borrower is required to provide cash collateral hereunder pursuant to Section 2.10(b)(ii), such cash collateral (to the extent not applied as set forth in this Section 2.05(l)) shall be returned to the Borrower as and to the extent that, after giving effect to such return, the aggregate Credit Exposures would not exceed the aggregate Commitments and no Specified Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

SECTION 2.06.	 Funding of Borrowings . 
 (a)	 Funding by Lenders . Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by (i) in the case of any Loan (other than an ABR Borrowing), 11:00 a.m. New York City time, and (ii) in the case of any Loan that is an ABR Borrowing, 1:00 p.m., New York City time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose, in each case, by notice to the Lenders; provided that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.04. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the Borrower designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request; provided that Borrowings made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(f) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank. 
 (b)	 Presumption by the Administrative Agent . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section 2.06 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in the corresponding Currency with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to ABR Loans in the case of a Dollar Borrowing or the interest rate applicable to such Borrowing in the case of a Multicurrency Borrowing. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in such Borrowing. Nothing in this paragraph shall relieve any Lender of its obligation to fulfill its commitments hereunder, and shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. 
 SECTION 2.07.	 Interest Elections .

Subject to Section 2.03(d), the Loans constituting each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Term Benchmark Borrowing, shall have the Interest Period specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a Borrowing of a different Type or to continue such Borrowing as a Borrowing of the same Type and, in the case of a Term Benchmark Borrowing, may elect the Interest Period therefor, all as provided in this Section 2.07; provided , however , that (i) a Borrowing of a Class may only be continued or converted into a Borrowing of the same Class, (ii) a Borrowing denominated in one Currency may not be continued as, or converted to, a Borrowing in a different Currency, (iii) no Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency or RFR Borrowing may be continued if, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate Revolving Multicurrency Credit Exposures would exceed the aggregate Multicurrency Commitments, and (iv) a Term Benchmark Borrowing 

751446606 754747243 
 70 

denominated in a Foreign Currency or RFR Borrowing may not be converted to a Borrowing of a different Type. The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders of the respective Class holding the Loans constituting such Borrowing, and the Loans constituting each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 2.07(a) shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued except in accordance with Section 2.04(c). 
 (b)	 Notice of Elections . To make an election pursuant to this Section 2.07, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone (confirmed by telecopy or electronic communication) by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly (but no later than the close of business on the date of such request) by hand delivery, telecopy or electronic communication to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request signed by the Borrower. 
 (c)	 Content of Interest Election Requests . Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02: 
 (i)	the Borrowing (including the Class) to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) of this paragraph shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing); 
 (ii)	the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day; 
 (iii)	whether, in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars, the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Term Benchmark Borrowing; and 
 (iv)	if the resulting Borrowing is a Term Benchmark Borrowing or RFR Borrowing, the Interest Period therefor after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term Interest Period and permitted under Section 2.02(d). 
 (d)	 Notice by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders . Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each applicable Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender s portion of each resulting Borrowing. 
 (e)	 Failure to Elect; Events of Default . If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely and complete Interest Election Request with respect to a Term Benchmark Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period therefor, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, (i) if such Borrowing is denominated in Dollars, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to a Term Benchmark Borrowing of the same Class having an Interest Period of one (1) month s duration, and (ii) if such Borrowing is denominated in a Foreign Currency, the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one (1) month s duration. Notwithstanding 

751446606 754747243 
 71 

any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing no outstanding Term Benchmark Borrowing or RFR Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency may have an Interest Period of more than one (1) month s duration. 
 SECTION 2.08.	 Termination, Reduction or Increase of the Commitments . 
 (a)	 Scheduled Termination . Unless previously terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Revolving Commitments of each Class shall terminate on the Commitment Termination Date. 
 (b)	 Voluntary Termination or Reduction . The Borrower may at any time without premium or penalty terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments ratably among (and within) each Class; provided that (i) each reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that is 5,000,000 (or, if less, the entire remaining amount of the Commitments of any Class) or a larger multiple of 1,000,000 in excess thereof (or the entire amount of the Commitments of such Class) and (ii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Revolving Commitments if, immediately after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans of any Class in accordance with Section 2.10, the total Revolving Credit Exposures of such Class would exceed the total Commitments of such Class. Any such reduction of the Commitments below the aggregate principal amount of the Swingline Loans permitted under Section 2.04(a)(i) and the aggregate amount of Letters of Credit permitted under Section 2.05(c)(i) shall result in a dollar-for-dollar reduction of such amounts as applicable. 
 (c)	 Notice of Voluntary Termination or Reduction . The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section 2.08 at least three (3) Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the applicable Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.08(c) shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination or reduction of the Commitments of a Class delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other events, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. 
 (d)	 Effect of Termination or Reduction . Any termination or reduction of the Commitments of a Class pursuant to clause (b) shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments pursuant to clause (b) shall be made ratably between the Multicurrency Commitments and the Dollar Commitments and ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments of each Class. 
 (e)	 Increase of the Commitments . 
 (i)	 Requests for Increase by Borrower . The Borrower shall have the right, at any time on or after the Effective Date but prior to the Commitment Termination Date, to propose that the Commitments of a Class hereunder be increased (each such proposed

Subject to Section 2.10(d), prior to any repayment or prepayment of any Borrowings hereunder, the Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings to be paid and shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone (confirmed by telecopy or electronic communication) of such selection not later than the time set forth in Section 2.10(e) prior to the scheduled date of such repayment; provided that, each repayment of Borrowings to any Lenders of a Class shall be applied to repay or prepay any outstanding ABR Borrowings of such Class before any other Borrowings of such Class. If the Borrower fails to make a timely selection of the Borrowing or Borrowings to be repaid or prepaid, such payment shall be applied, first, solely in the case of any payment of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars, to pay any outstanding ABR Borrowings pro rata between any outstanding Dollar ABR Borrowings and outstanding Multicurrency ABR Borrowings, second, if no Class is specified and such payment relates to a Borrowing denominated in Dollars, to any Pro-Rata Borrowings in the order of the remaining duration of their respective Interest Periods (the Pro-Rata Borrowing with the shortest remaining Interest Period to be repaid or prepaid first) and, third, within each Class, to any 

751446606 754747243

remaining Borrowings in the order of the remaining duration of their respective Interest Periods (the Borrowing with the shortest remaining Interest Period to be repaid or prepaid first).

If the repayment or prepayment is denominated in an Agreed Foreign Currency (including as a result of the Borrower s receipt of proceeds from a prepayment event in such Agreed Foreign Currency), the Borrower may, at its option, repay or prepay any outstanding Borrowings in such Currency ratably among just the Multicurrency Lenders in the order of the remaining duration of their respective Interest Periods, commencing with such Borrowings with the shortest remaining Interest Period, and, if after such payment, the balance of the Borrowings denominated in such Currency is zero (0), then if there are any remaining proceeds, the Borrower shall repay or prepay the Loans (or provide cover for outstanding Letters of Credit as contemplated by Section 2.05(l)) on a pro-rata basis between each outstanding Class of Revolving Credit Exposure in the order of the remaining duration of their respective Interest Periods, commencing with such Borrowings with the shortest remaining Interest Period. 
 (c)	 Maintenance of Records by Lenders . Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice records evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts and Currency of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.

The Administrative Agent shall maintain records in which it shall record (i) the amount and Currency of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof and each Interest Period therefor, (ii) the amount and Currency of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender of such Class hereunder and (iii) the amount and Currency of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender s share thereof. 
 (e)	 Effect of Entries . The entries made in the records maintained pursuant to paragraph (c) or (d) of this Section 2.09 shall be prima facie evidence, absent manifest error, of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such records or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. In the event of any conflict between the Register and any other accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent, the Register shall control in the absence of manifest error.

In addition, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, each Lender and each Issuing Bank shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender or Issuing Bank is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two (2) sentences, the completion, execution and delivery of such documentation (other than completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or documentation required under Section 2.16(h)) shall not be required if in the Lender or Issuing Bank s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or delivery would subject such Lender or Issuing Bank to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender or Issuing Bank. 
 (h)	 FATCA . If a payment made to a Lender or Issuing Bank under any Loan Document would be subject to United States federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender or Issuing Bank were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender or Issuing Bank shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender or Issuing Bank has complied with such Lender or Issuing Bank s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.

 (i)	 Treatment of Certain Refunds . If the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund (or credit in lieu of such refund) of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.16, it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund or credit (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 2.16 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund or credit), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund or credit), provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank, agrees to repay the

amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank in the event the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank is required to repay such refund or credit to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (i), in no event will the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank be required to pay any amount to the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph (i) the payment of which would place the Administrative Agent or such Lender in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank to make available its tax returns or its books or records (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. 
 (j)	Each party s obligations, agreements and waivers under this Section 2.16 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any transfer of rights or obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender or Issuing Bank, the termination of the Commitments and/or the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.

Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.

The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.

is a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor, on the last day of such Interest Period) in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent thereof on the date of such redenomination and such principal shall be payable on demand; and if the Borrower shall fail to pay any interest on any Loan that is not denominated in Dollars, such interest shall automatically be redenominated in Dollars on the due date therefor (or, if such due date is a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor, on the last day of such Interest Period) in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent thereof on the date of such redenomination and such interest shall be payable on demand. 
 (b)	 Application of Insufficient Payments . If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees of a Class then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees of such Class then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees of such Class then due to such parties, and (ii) second, to pay principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements of such Class then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements of such Class then due to such parties. 
 (c)	 Pro Rata Treatment . Except to the extent otherwise provided herein: (i) each Borrowing of a Class shall be made from the Lenders of such Class, and each termination or reduction of the amount of the Commitments of a Class under Section 2.08 shall be applied to the respective Commitments of the Lenders of such Class, pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments of such Class; (ii) each Borrowing of a Class shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders of such Class according to the amounts of their respective Commitments of such Class (in the case of the making of Loans) or their respective Loans of such Class that are to be included in such Borrowing (in the case of conversions and continuations of Loans); (iii) each payment of commitment fees under Section 2.11 shall be made for the account of the Lenders pro rata according to the average daily unused amounts of their respective Commitments; (iv) each payment or prepayment of principal of Loans of a Class by the Borrower shall be made for the account of the Lenders of such Class pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Loans of such Class held by them; and (v) each payment of interest on Loans of a Class of Commitments or Maturity Date by the Borrower shall be made for the account of the Lenders of such Class pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest on such Loans then due and payable to such Lenders. 
 (d)	 Sharing of Payments by Lenders . If any Lender of a Class shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans, or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans, of such Class resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans, and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, and accrued interest thereon of such Class then due than the proportion received by any other Lender of such Class, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans, and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, of other Lenders of such Class to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders of such Class ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans, and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of such Class; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all 

751446606 754747243 
 95 

or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. For the avoidance of doubt, the Borrower may make a Borrowing under the Dollar Commitments or Multicurrency Commitments (if otherwise permitted hereunder) and may use the proceeds of such Borrowing (x) with Dollar Commitments to prepay the Multicurrency Loans (without making a ratable prepayment of the Dollar Loans) or (y) with Multicurrency Commitments to prepay the Dollar Loans (without making a ratable payment to the Multicurrency Loans). 
 (e)	 Presumptions of Payment . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Banks, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or each of the Issuing Banks, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or such Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate. 
 (f)	 Certain Deductions by the Administrative Agent . If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(e), 2.06(a), 2.17(d) or 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid. 
 SECTION 2.18.	 Defaulting Lenders . 
 Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender: 
 (a)	commitment fees pursuant to Section 2.11(a) shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Revolving Commitment of such Defaulting Lender; 

751446606 754747243 
 96 

(b)	the Commitment and Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether two-thirds (2/3rds) of the Lenders, two-thirds (2/3rds) of the Lenders of a Class, the Required Lenders or the Required Lenders of a Class have taken or may take any action hereunder or any other Loan Documents (including any consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to Section 9.02), provided that any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders (or all Lenders of a Class) or each affected Lender (if applicable to such Defaulting Lender), including as set forth in Section 9.02(b)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v), shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender; 
 (c)	if any Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure exists at the time a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then: 
 (i)	all or any part of such Swingline Exposure (other than the portion of such Swingline Exposure consisting of Swingline Loans made by such Defaulting Lender) and LC Exposure shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders holding Commitments of the same Class as such Defaulting Lender in accordance with their respective Applicable Multicurrency Percentages or Applicable Dollar Percentages, as applicable, but only to the extent (x) in the case of a Defaulting Lender that holds Commitments of a particular Class, the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders Revolving Credit Exposures of such Class plus such Defaulting Lender s Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of such Class does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders Commitments of such Class, and (y) no non-Defaulting Lender s Revolving Credit Exposure of the applicable Class will exceed such Lender s Commitment of such Class; 
 (ii)	if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under law, within three (3) Business Days following notice by the Administrative Agent (x) first, prepay such Defaulting Lender s Swingline Exposure and (y) second, cash collateralize such Defaulting Lender s LC Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.05(l) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding; 
 (iii)	if the Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender s LC Exposure pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender s LC Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lender s LC Exposure is cash collateralized; 
 (iv)	if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders of the same Class as such Defaulting Lender is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.11(a) and Section 2.11(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders Applicable Multicurrency Percentages or Applicable Dollar Percentages, as applicable, in effect immediately after giving effect to such reallocation; and 

751446606 754747243 
 97 

(v)	if any Defaulting Lender s LC Exposure is neither cash collateralized nor reallocated pursuant to this Section 2.18(c), then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any Issuing Bank or any Lender hereunder, all commitment fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender (solely with respect to the portion of such Defaulting Lender s Commitment that was utilized by such LC Exposure) and letter of credit fees payable under Section 2.11(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender s LC Exposure shall be payable to the applicable Issuing Bank until such LC Exposure is cash collateralized and/or reallocated; and 
 (d)	so long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no Swingline Lenders of the same Class of such Defaulting Lender shall be required to fund any Swingline Loan of such Class and no Issuing Bank of the same Class or such Defaulting Lender shall be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit of such Class, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure will be 100 covered by the Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders of the applicable Class and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.18(c), and Swingline Exposure related to any newly made Swingline Loan and participating interests in any such newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders of such Class in a manner consistent with Section 2.18(c)(i) (and Defaulting Lenders shall not participate therein). 
 In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrower, the Swingline Lenders and the Issuing Banks (with respect to the Swingline Lenders and the Issuing Banks, only to the extent that such Swingline Lender or Issuing Bank acts in such capacity under the same Class of Commitments held by a Defaulting Lender) each agrees in writing that such Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then on the date of such agreement, such Lender shall no longer be deemed a Defaulting Lender, the Borrower shall no longer be required to cash collateralize any portion of such Lender s LC Exposure cash collateralized pursuant to Section 2.18(c)(ii) above and the Swingline Exposure and the LC Exposure of the Lenders of the affected Class shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender s Commitment of such Class and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders of such Class (other than Swingline Loans) as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Multicurrency Percentage or Applicable Dollar Percentage, as applicable, in effect immediately after giving effect to such agreement. 
 No reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such non-Defaulting Lender s increased exposure following such reallocation. 
 SECTION 2.19.	 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders . 
 (a)	 Designation of a Different Lending Office . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, 

751446606 754747243 
 98 

branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any cost or expense not required to be reimbursed by the Borrower and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. 
 (b)	 Replacement of Lenders . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, or if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender or is a non-consenting Lender (as provided in Section 9.02(d)), then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and, if a Revolving Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Banks and the Swingline Lender), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts then due and payable), and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. 
 (c)	 Defaulting Lender . If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(e), 2.06(a), 2.17(d) or 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender for the benefit of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Banks to satisfy such Lender s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under such Sections; in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion. 
 SECTION 2.20.	 Illegality . If any Change in Law shall make it unlawful or impossible for any Lender to perform any of its obligations hereunder, to make, maintain or fund any RFR Loan or Term Benchmark Loan or to determine or charge interest rates based upon any applicable Daily Simple RFR or Relevant Rate and such Lender shall so notify the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall give written notice thereof (or telephonic notice, promptly confirmed in writing) to the Borrower and the other Lenders as promptly as practicable thereafter, whereupon until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) the Alternate Base Rate shall, if 

751446606 754747243 
 99 

necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to clause (iii) thereof, (ii) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or the continuation of any Borrowing as, a Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in the affected Currency shall be ineffective and, if the affected Currency is Dollars, such Borrowing (unless prepaid) shall be continued as, or converted to, an ABR Borrowing either (A) at the end of the applicable Interest Period if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Loan to such date or (B) immediately if such Lender shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain such Term Benchmark Loan to such date, (iii) if the affected Currency is Dollars and any Borrowing Request requests a Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in Dollars, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing, (iv) if the affected Currency is a Foreign Currency other than CAD, (A) any Borrowing Request that requests a Term Benchmark Borrowing or RFR Borrowing denominated in the affected Currency shall be made as a Term Benchmark Borrowing with a Relevant Rate equal to the Central Bank Rate for the applicable Agreed Foreign Currency; provided , that if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Central Bank Rate for the applicable Agreed Foreign Currency cannot be determined, such Borrowing Request shall be ineffective, and (B) any outstanding Term Benchmark Borrowing or RFR Borrowing in the affected Currency, at the Borrower s election shall either (1) be converted to a Term Benchmark Borrowing with a Relevant Rate equal to the Central Bank Rate for the applicable Agreed Foreign Currency; provided that, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Central Bank Rate for the applicable Agreed Foreign Currency cannot be determined, such Borrowing shall be converted into an ABR Borrowing denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such affected Currency) immediately in the case of an RFR Borrowing or, in the case of a Term Benchmark Borrowing, either (x) at the end of the applicable Interest Period if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Loan to such date or (y) immediately if such Lender shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain such Term Benchmark Loan to such date, (2) be converted into an ABR Borrowing denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such affected Currency) immediately in the case of an RFR Borrowing or, in the case of a Term Benchmark Borrowing, either (x) at the end of the applicable Interest Period if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Loan to such date or (y) immediately if such Lender shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain such Term Benchmark Loan to such date, or (3) be prepaid in full immediately in the case of an RFR Borrowing or, in the case of a Term Benchmark Borrowing, either (x) at the end of the applicable Interest Period if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Loan to such date or (y) immediately if such Lender shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain such Term Benchmark Loan to such date, and (v) if the affected Currency is CAD, (A) any Borrowing Request that requests a Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in CAD shall be made as a Term Benchmark Borrowing with a Relevant Rate equal to the Canadian Prime Rate; provided , that if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Canadian Prime Rate cannot be determined, such Borrowing Request shall be ineffective, and (B) any outstanding Term Benchmark Borrowing in CAD, at the Borrower s election, shall either (1) be converted to a Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in CAD with a Relevant Rate equal to the Canadian Prime Rate at the end of applicable Interest Period; provided that, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Canadian Prime Rate cannot be determined, such Borrowing shall be 

751446606 754747243 
 100 

converted into an ABR Borrowing denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such affected Currency) either (x) at the end of the applicable Interest Period if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Loan to such date or (y) immediately if such Lender shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain such Term Benchmark Loan to such date, (2) be converted into an ABR Borrowing denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such affected Currency) either (x) at the end of the applicable Interest Period if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Loan to such date or (y) immediately if such Lender shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain such Term Benchmark Loan to such date, or (3) be prepaid in full at the end of the applicable Interest Period; provided that if no election is made by the Borrower by the date that is three Business Days after receipt by the Borrower of such notice or, in the case of a Term Benchmark Borrowing, the last day of the current Interest Period for the applicable Term Benchmark Loan, if earlier, the Borrower shall be deemed to have elected clause (iv)(B)(1) or (v)(B)(1) above, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the affected Lender shall, prior to giving such notice to the Administrative Agent, use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office if such designation would avoid the need for giving such notice and if such designation would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender in the good faith exercise of its discretion. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 2.14 .

For purposes of this Agreement, the Borrower, in its reasonable determination, shall assign each Portfolio Investment included in the Borrowing Base to an Industry Classification Group. To the extent that the Borrower reasonably determines that any Portfolio Investment included in the Borrowing Base is not adequately correlated with the risks of other Portfolio Investments in an Industry Classification Group, such Portfolio Investment may be assigned by the Borrower to an Industry Classification Group that is more closely correlated to such Portfolio Investment. In the absence of adequate correlation, the Borrower shall be permitted, upon notice to the Administrative Agent for distribution to each Lender, to create up to three (3) additional industry classification groups for purposes of this Agreement. 
 (b)	 Portfolio Valuation Etc . 
 (i)	 Settlement Date Basis . For purposes of this Agreement, all determinations of whether an investment is to be included as a Portfolio Investment shall be determined on a settlement-date basis (meaning that any investment that has been purchased will not be treated as a Portfolio Investment until such purchase has settled, and any Portfolio Investment which has been sold will not be excluded as a Portfolio Investment until such sale has settled), provided that no such investment shall be included as a Portfolio Investment to the extent it has not been paid for in full. 
 (ii)	 Determination of Values . The Borrower will conduct reviews of the value to be assigned to each of its Portfolio Investments included in the Borrowing Base as follows: 
 (A)	 Quoted Investments External Review . With respect to Portfolio Investments (including Cash Equivalents) for which market quotations are readily available and that are traded in an active and orderly market as determined by the Borrower Quoted Investments ), the Borrower shall value such Quoted Investments in accordance with its Valuation Policy and, solely with respect to Portfolio Investments included in the Borrowing Base, not less frequently than once each calendar week, determine the market value of such Quoted Investments which shall, in each case, be determined in accordance with one (1) of the following methodologies (as selected by the Borrower):

 116 

(y)	in the case of any Quoted Investment traded on an exchange, the closing price for such Portfolio Investment most recently posted on such exchange, and 
 (z)	in the case of any other Quoted Investment, the fair market value thereof as determined by an Approved Pricing Service selected by the Borrower; and 
 (B)	 Unquoted Investments External Review . With respect to each Portfolio Investment included in the Borrowing Base for which market quotations are not readily available (each, an Unquoted Investment ), as determined by the Borrower, the Borrower shall, commencing with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2023, value such Unquoted Investments quarterly in a manner consistent with its Valuation Policy and, solely with respect to Portfolio Investments in the Borrowing Base (other than any Portfolio Investments that the Administrative Agent has most recently notified the Borrower that it intends to have an Approved Third-Party Appraiser selected by the Administrative Agent value), request an Approved Third-Party Appraiser to assist the Advisor (so long as it has the necessary delegated authority) or the board of directors of the Borrower (or the appropriate committee thereof with the necessary delegated authority) in determining the fair market value of such Unquoted Investments (1) with respect to Unquoted Investments held for a full calendar year, as at the last day of two non-consecutive fiscal quarters each calendar year (or, with respect to the calendar year in which the Effective Date occurs, as at the last day of at least one fiscal quarter in such calendar year) and (2) with respect to Unquoted Investments held for less than one full calendar year but more than one full calendar quarter, as at the last day of at least one fiscal quarter in such calendar year, in each case, and with respect to each calendar year, as selected by the Borrower in its sole discretion (each, a Testing Quarter ); provided that: 
 (x)	 the Value of any such Unquoted Investment acquired during a Testing Quarter shall be deemed to be equal to the cost of such Unquoted Investment until such time as the fair market value of such Unquoted Investment is determined in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this sub-clause (B) as at the last day of such Testing Quarter; 
 (y)	notwithstanding the foregoing clause (B), the Advisor (so long as it has the necessary delegated authority) or the board of directors of the Borrower (or the appropriate committee thereof with the necessary delegated authority) may, without the assistance of an Approved Third-Party Appraiser, determine the Value of an Unquoted Investment so long as the aggregate Value thereof of all such Unquoted Investments so determined in reliance on this clause (y) does not at any time exceed 10 of the aggregate Borrowing Base for any Testing Quarter, except that the Value of any Unquoted Investment that has been determined without the assistance of an Approved Third-Party Appraiser in reliance on this clause (y) as at the last day of any Testing Quarter with respect to such Unquoted Investment shall be deemed to be zero as at the last day of the immediately succeeding Testing Quarter with respect to such Unquoted Investment (but effective upon the date upon which the Borrowing Base Certificate for such last day is required to be delivered 

751446606 754747243 
 117 

hereunder) if an Approved Third-Party Appraiser has not assisted the Advisor (so long as it has the necessary delegated authority) or the board of directors of the Borrower (or the appropriate committee thereof with the necessary delegated authority), as applicable, in determining the fair market value of such Unquoted Investments, as at such date; and 
 (z)	the Value, at the end of any fiscal quarter, of any such Unquoted Investment that was acquired within thirty (30) days of the end of such fiscal quarter (collectively, the Market Value Investments shall be deemed to be equal to the cost of such Portfolio Investment. 
 (C)	 Internal Review . The Borrower shall conduct internal reviews of all Portfolio Investments included in the Borrowing Base at least once each calendar week which shall take into account any events of which any responsible officer of the Borrower has knowledge that materially and adversely affect the aggregate value of the Portfolio Investments included in the Borrowing Base (including the existence of any buyout right for any Portfolio Investment at a purchase price that is less than the value of any Portfolio Investment established under Sections 5.12(b)(ii)(A) or (B) above). If the value of any Portfolio Investment as most recently determined by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 5.12(b)(ii)(C) is lower than the value of such Portfolio Investment as most recently determined pursuant to Sections 5.12(b)(ii)(A) and (B), such lower value shall be deemed to be the Value of such Portfolio Investment for purposes hereof. 
 (D)	 Failure to Determine Values . If the Borrower shall fail to determine the value of any Portfolio Investment as at any date pursuant to the requirements (but subject to the exclusions) of the foregoing subclauses (A) through (C), the Value of such Portfolio Investment as at such date shall be deemed to be zero (0) for purposes of the Borrowing Base until such time as the Value of such Portfolio Investment is otherwise determined or reviewed, as applicable, in accordance with this Agreement. 
 (E)	 Scheduled Testing of Values . 
 (1)	For the second calendar month immediately following the end of each fiscal quarter (the last such period ended is referred to herein as, the Testing Period ), commencing with the period ending on May 31, 2023, the Administrative Agent shall have the right to cause an Approved Third-Party Appraiser selected by the Administrative Agent to value such number of Unquoted Investments ((x) included in the Borrowing Base as of the end of such Testing Period or at any time between the end of such Testing Period and the end of the immediately preceding Testing Period, in each case, unless such Portfolio Investment is no longer in the Collateral Pool pursuant to a transaction permitted hereunder and (y) selected by the Administrative Agent) that collectively have an aggregate Value approximately equal to the Calculation Amount. The Administrative Agent agrees to notify the Borrower of the Unquoted Investments selected by the Administrative Agent to be tested in each Testing Period. If there is a difference between the Borrower s valuation and the Approved Third-Party Appraiser s valuation of any Unquoted Investment, the Value of such Unquoted 

751446606 754747243 
 118 

Investment for Borrowing Base purposes shall be established as set forth in sub-clause (F) below. 
 (2)	For the avoidance of doubt, the valuation of any Approved Third-Party Appraiser selected by the Administrative Agent would not be as of, or delivered at, the end of any fiscal quarter. Any such valuation would be as of the end of the second month immediately following any fiscal quarter and would be reflected in the Borrowing Base Certificate for such month provided that such Approved Third-Party Appraiser delivers such valuation at least seven Business Days before the 20 th day after the end of the applicable monthly accounting period and, if such valuation is delivered after such time, it shall be included in the Borrowing Base Certificate for the following monthly period and applied to the then applicable balance of the related Portfolio Investment). For illustrative purposes, if the given fiscal quarter is the fourth quarter ending on December 31, 2021, then (A) the Administrative Agent would initiate the testing of Values (using the December 31, 2021 Values for purposes of determining the scope of the testing under clause (E)(x) during the month of February with the anticipation of receiving the valuations from the applicable Approved Third-Party Appraiser(s) on or after February 28, 2022 and (B) (x) if such valuations were received before the seventh Business Day before March 20, 2022, such valuations would be included in the March 20, 2022 Borrowing Base Certificate covering the month of February, or (y) if such valuations were received after such time, they would be included in the April 20, 2022 Borrowing Base Certificate for the month of March. 
 For the avoidance of doubt, all calculations of value pursuant to this Section 5.12(b)(ii)(E) shall be determined without application of the Advance Rates. 
 (F)	 Supplemental Testing of Values . Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall at any time have the right to request, in its reasonable discretion, any Unquoted Investment included in the Borrowing Base with a value determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) (other than, so long as no Event of Default exists, any Portfolio Investment included in the Borrowing Base tested pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii)(E) as of the most recent Testing Period) to be independently valued by an Approved Third-Party Appraiser selected by the Administrative Agent. There shall be no limit on the number of such appraisals requested by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion; provided that, (i) any appraisal shall be conducted in a manner that is not disruptive to the Borrower s business and (ii) the values determined by any appraisal shall be treated as confidential information by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and shall be deemed to be Information hereunder and subject to Section 9.13 hereof. The reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs of any such valuation shall be at the expense of the Borrower; provided that, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower s obligations to reimburse valuation costs incurred by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 5.12(b)(ii)(F) (excluding any valuation costs and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent as a result of a regulatory directive) shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to 450,000 (the IVP Supplemental Cap in any twelve month period. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of its receipt of results from an Approved Third-Party Appraiser of any appraisal and provide a 

751446606 754747243 
 119 

copy of the results and any related reports to the Borrower. If the difference between the Borrower s valuation pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii)(B) and the valuation of any Approved Third-Party Appraiser selected by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii)(E) or (F) is (1) less than 5 of the Borrower s value thereof, then the Borrower s valuation shall be used, (2) between 5 and 20 of the Borrower s value thereof, then the valuation of such Portfolio Investment shall be the average of the value determined by the Borrower and the value determined by the Approved Third-Party Appraiser retained by the Administrative Agent and (3) greater than 20 of the Borrower s value thereof, then the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall select an additional Approved Third-Party Appraiser and the valuation of such Portfolio Investment shall be the average of the three valuations (with the average of the Administrative Agent s Approved Third-Party Appraiser s valuation and the Borrower s valuation to be used until the third valuation is obtained). For the avoidance of doubt, Portfolio Investments that are part of the Collateral but not included in the Borrowing Base as of the most recent Testing Period shall not be subject to testing under this Section 5.12(b)(ii)(F) ; provided that this sentence shall not limit the rights of the Administrative Agent set forth in Section 9.03(a)(iii) to be reimbursed for costs and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default. 
 (iii)	 Generally Applicable Valuation Provisions . 
 (A)	Each Approved Third-Party Appraiser (whether selected by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) shall apply a recognized valuation methodology that is commonly accepted in the Borrower s industry for valuing Portfolio Investments of the type being valued and held by the Obligors. Other procedures relating to the valuation will be reasonably agreed upon by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower. 
 (B)	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, from the Effective Date until the date when the first valuation report with respect to the applicable Portfolio Investment is required to be delivered under Section 5.12(b)(ii)(B) or (E) , as applicable, the Value of any Portfolio Investment included in the Borrowing Base shall be the Value as delivered to the Collateral Agent on or prior to the Effective Date. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to Section 5.12(b)(ii)(B) the value of any Portfolio Investments determined in accordance with any provision of this Section 5.12 shall be the Value of such Portfolio Investment for purposes of this Agreement until a new Value for such Portfolio Investment is subsequently required to be determined in good faith in accordance with this Section 5.12 . 
 (C)	The Administrative Agent and each Lender acknowledges that it may be required to enter into a non-reliance letter, confidentiality agreement or similar agreement requested or required by a proposed appraiser to allow the Administrative Agent or such Lender to review any written valuation report. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, there shall be no requirement to disclose any portion of any report submitted by an Approved Third-Party Appraiser without such a non-reliance letter if such non-reliance letter is required by such Approved Third-Party Appraiser as a condition to such disclosure. 

751446606 754747243 
 120 

(iv)	For the avoidance of doubt, any Values determined by the Independent Valuation Provider pursuant to Sections 5.12(b)(ii)(E) and (F) shall only be required to be used for purposes of calculating the Borrowing Base and shall not be required to be utilized for any other purpose, including, without limitation, the delivery of financial statements or valuations required under ASC 820 or the Investment Company Act.

The Borrower will at all times, subject to applicable grace or cure periods set forth in the Code, comply with the portfolio diversification and similar requirements set forth in the Code applicable to RICs, where applicable. 
 (d)	 Participation Interests .

 SECTION 5.13.	 Calculation of Borrowing Base .

The Administrative Agent shall not be liable to any Lender or Issuing Bank for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents) or in the absence of its own fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein or therein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.

751446606 754747243 
 151 

in a final and non-appealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents. 
 The Administrative Agent may resign by providing not less than thirty (30) days advance written notice to the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Borrower. Upon any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrower not to be unreasonably withheld (or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing in consultation with the Borrower), to appoint a successor, which is not a natural person, a Defaulting Lender or a Disqualified Lender. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent s resignation shall nonetheless become effective at the end of such thirty (30) days period (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (1) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and (2) the Required Lenders shall perform the duties of the Administrative Agent (and all payments and communications provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly) until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above in this paragraph.

The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the Administrative Agent s resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent. Any resignation by Truist Bank as Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section shall also constitute its resignation as an Issuing Bank and a Swingline Lender. Upon the acceptance of a successor s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, (a) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender, (b) the retiring Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender shall be discharged from all of their respective duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, and (c) the successor Issuing Bank shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to the retiring Issuing Bank to effectively assume the obligations of the retiring Issuing Bank with respect to such Letters of Credit.

Unless otherwise notified by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower, the Borrower may satisfy its obligation to deliver documents or notices to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders under Sections 5.01 and 5.12(a) by delivering an electronic copy to: hays.wood@truist.com with a copy to agency.services@truist.com (or such other e mail address as provided to the Borrower in a notice from the Administrative Agent) (and the Administrative Agent shall promptly provide notice thereof to the Lenders).

 In no event shall the Administrative Agent or any Lender have any liability to the Borrower or any other Person for damages of any kind (whether in tort contract or otherwise) arising out of any transmission of communications through the internet, except in the case of direct damages, to the extent such damages are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the bad faith, fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence of such relevant Person.

 SECTION 9.02.	 Waivers; Amendments . 
 (a)	 No Deemed Waivers; Remedies Cumulative . No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section 9.02, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. 
 (b)	 Amendments to this Agreement . Except as provided in Section 2.13(b) and the definition of Modification Offer , neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that no such agreement shall: 
 (i)	increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, 
 (ii)	reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon (other than the application of any interest accrued pursuant to Section 2.12(d) or as specifically contemplated herein), or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby, 
 (iii)	postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby, 
 (iv)	change Section 2.17(b), (c) or (d) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby without the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby, or 

751446606 754747243 
 159 

(v)	change any of the provisions of this Section 9.02 or the definition of the term Required Lenders or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby; 
 provided further that (x) no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, (y) the consent of each Multicurrency Lender will be required for any change to the definition of Agreed Foreign Currency and (z) the consent of Lenders holding not less than two-thirds (2/3rds) of the Credit Exposure and unused Commitments will be required for (A) any adverse changes (from the Lenders perspective) affecting the provisions of this Agreement solely relating to the calculation of the Borrowing Base (excluding changes to the provisions of Section 5.12(b)(iii) or (iv), but including changes to the provisions of Section 5.12(c) and the definitions set forth in Section 5.13) unless otherwise expressly provided herein and (B) any release of material portions of the Collateral other than for fair value or as otherwise not prohibited hereunder or under the other Loan Documents. 
 For purposes of this Section 9.02, the scheduled date of payment of any amount shall refer to the date of payment of such amount specified in this Agreement, and shall not refer to a date or other event specified for the mandatory or optional prepayment of such amount. In addition, whenever a waiver, amendment or modification requires the consent of a Lender affected thereby, such waiver, amendment or modification shall, upon consent of such Lender, become effective as to such Lender whether or not it becomes effective as to any other Lender, so long as the Required Lenders consent to such waiver, amendment or modification as provided above. 
 Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding (x) no waiver or modification of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Lenders of any Class in a manner that does not affect all Classes equally shall be effective against the Lenders of such Class unless the Required Lenders of such Class shall have concurred with such waiver, amendment or modification as provided above; provided , however , for the avoidance of doubt, in no other circumstances shall the concurrence of the Required Lenders of a particular Class be required for any waiver, amendment or modification of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document; and (y) the Required Lenders may waive any condition precedent to an extension of credit under the Revolving Commitments (other than as required by Section 4.02) (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not constitute a waiver of any ongoing or resulting Default or Event of Default). 
 (c)	 Amendments to Security Documents . Except to the extent otherwise expressly set forth in the Guarantee and Security Agreement or the other Loan Documents, no Security Document nor any provision thereof may be waived, amended or modified, nor may the Liens granted under the Guarantee and Security Agreement be spread to secure any additional obligations (excluding (x) any increase in the Loans and Letters of Credit hereunder pursuant to a Commitment Increase under Section 2.08(e), (y) any increase in any Other Secured Indebtedness or Shorter Term Secured Indebtedness permitted hereunder and (z) the spreading of such Liens to 

751446606 754747243 
 160 

any Designated Indebtedness or Hedging Agreement Obligations (as defined in the Guarantee and Security Agreement) as provided for in the Guarantee and Security Agreement), except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower, and by the Collateral Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that, (i) except as otherwise expressly permitted by the Loan Documents, without the written consent of each Lender and each Issuing Bank, no such agreement shall release all or substantially all of the Obligors from their respective obligations under the Security Documents and (ii) except as otherwise expressly permitted by the Loan Documents, without the written consent of each Lender and each Issuing Bank, no such agreement shall release all or substantially all of the collateral security or otherwise terminate all or substantially all of the Liens under the Security Documents, alter the relative priorities of the obligations entitled to the Liens created under the Security Documents (except in connection with securing additional obligations equally and ratably with the Loans and other obligations hereunder) with respect to all or substantially all of the collateral security provided thereby, except that no such consent shall be required, and the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized (and so agrees with the Borrower) to direct the Collateral Agent under the Guarantee and Security Agreement to, and in addition to the rights of such parties under the Guarantee and Security Agreement, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent under the Guarantee and Security Agreement may, (1) release any Lien covering property (and to release any such guarantor) that is the subject of either a disposition of property not prohibited hereunder (including, without limitation, any property subject to a participation or repurchase transaction) or a disposition to which the Required Lenders or the required number or percentage of Lenders have consented (and such Lien shall be released automatically (A) to the extent provided in Section 10.03 of the Guarantee and Security Agreement and (B) to the extent permitted hereunder in connection with any property becoming subject to a participation or repurchase transaction), and (2) release from the Guarantee and Security Agreement any Subsidiary Guarantor (and any property of such Subsidiary Guarantor) that is designated as a Designated Subsidiary , becomes an Excluded Asset or an Immaterial Subsidiary or is otherwise no longer required to be a Subsidiary Guarantor (including, without limitation, because it ceases to be consolidated on the Borrower s financial statements). 
 (d)	 Replacement of Non-Consenting Lender . If, in connection with any proposed change, waiver, amendment, consent, discharge or termination to any of the provisions of this Agreement as contemplated by this Section 9.02, the consent of one (1) or more Lenders whose consent is required for such proposed change, waiver, amendment, consent, discharge or termination is not obtained, then (so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing) the Borrower shall have the right, at its sole cost and expense, to replace each such non-consenting Lender or Lenders with one (1) or more replacement Lenders pursuant to Section 2.19(b) so long as at the time of such replacement, each such replacement Lender consents to the proposed change, waiver, discharge, termination or addition. 
 (e)	If the Administrative Agent and the Borrower acting together identify any ambiguity, omission, mistake, typographical error or other defect in any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, then the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall be permitted to amend, modify or supplement such provision to cure such ambiguity, omission, mistake, typographical error or other defect, and such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement.

To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.16(e) as though it were a Lender hereunder. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant s interest in the Commitments or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register ); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant s interest in any commitments, loans or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. 
 (f)	 Limitations on Rights of Participants . A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.16 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 2.16 as though it were a Lender and the applicable Lender shall provide the Borrower with satisfactory evidence that the participation is in registered form and shall permit the Borrower to review such register as reasonably needed for the Borrower to comply with its obligations under applicable laws and regulations.

 (h)	 No Assignments to Natural Persons, the Borrower or Affiliates .
