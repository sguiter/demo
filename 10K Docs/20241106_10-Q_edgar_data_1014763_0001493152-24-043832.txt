on December 14, 2023 after receiving required approvals. 

The

and options to purchase common stock and per share amounts contained in the financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to
give effect to the reverse stock splits for all periods presented. 

. The Company plans to finance its operations and development
needs with its existing cash and cash equivalents, additional equity and/or debt financing arrangements, to support the Company s
clinical trial activities, largely in connection with Ainos Flora and human related VELDONA therapeutics. There can be no assurance that
the Company will be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to the Company, on a timely basis, or at all. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company generated a net loss of .
The Company expects to continue incurring development expenses for the next twelve months as the Company advances Ainos Flora and VELDONA

by removing major separation models required under current GAAP. ASU 2020-06 as issued by FASB in August 2020 removes certain settlement
conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, and it also simplifies the diluted earnings
per share calculation in certain areas. ASU 2020-06 is effective for SRC s fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including
interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company s early adoption of this new guidance did
not have a material impact on its financial statements and related disclosures.

should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the related Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, both of which are contained in our Form 10-K for the period
ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Annual Report ). In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains
forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including
those set forth under Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report, Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors 
in this Quarterly Report, and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical
results or anticipated results. 

When
used in this Quarterly Report, all references to Ainos, the Company, we, our 
and us refer to Ainos, Inc. 

Overview 

Ainos,
Inc. (the Company ), incorporated in the State of Texas in 1984, is a diversified healthcare company focused on the development
of novel point-of-care testing (the POCT ), therapeutics based on very low-dose interferon alpha (the VELDONA ),
and synthetic RNA-driven preventative medicine. Our product pipeline includes commercial-stage VELDONA Pet cytoprotein supplements, clinical-stage
VELDONA human and animal therapeutics and telehealth-friendly POCTs powered by the AI Nose technology platform. 

We
have historically involved in the research and development of therapeutics based on VELDONA. Building on our research and development
on VELDONA since inception, we are focused on commercializing a suite of VELDONA-based product candidates. Currently our priority VELDONA
pipeline includes drug candidates for treating oral
warts for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositive patients, Sj gren s syndrome, and
feline chronic gingivostomatitis (FCGS), a cat oral infection. 

In
2021 and 2022, we acquired certain types of intellectual property from controlling shareholder, Ainos Inc., a Cayman Island corporation Ainos KY ), to expand product portfolio into POCTs aimed to provide connected, rapid, and convenient testing for a broad
range of health conditions. Pivoting from the sales of COVID-19 POCT, we aim to commercialize POCTs that detect volatile organic compounds
(the VOC emitted by the body, powered by our AI Nose technology platform. Our AI Nose technology platform implements digital
nose sensors and our proprietary algorithm to analyze and digitally profile VOCs emitted by the body. Our lead VOC POCT candidate, Ainos
Flora, aims to test female vaginal health and certain common sexually transmitted infections (the STIs quickly and easily. 

 We
believe AI Nose has additional opportunities in telehealth, automotive, industrial, and environmental safety applications. To address
these additional opportunities, we are codeveloping a VOC POCT solution for the elderly care market. We are also codeveloping a VOC sensing
solution to address the industrial market, as our first move to expand the application of AI Nose beyond healthcare. Our vision is to
leverage digital nose sensors and our proprietary VOC sensing AI algorithm, to digitize smell and ultimately become AI s nose. 

 Our
Pipeline 

An
integral part of our operating strategy is to create multiple revenue streams through sales of commercially ready products, out-licensing
or forming strategic relationships to develop and commercialize our products. As of September 30, 2024, we have commercialized the following
products: 

COVID-19
 Antigen Rapid Test Kit . As the first commercialized products we sell, we have marketed COVID-19 antigen rapid test kits in Taiwan
 under emergency use authorization EUA issued by the Taiwan Federal and Drug Administration TFDA to
 TCNT, the product manufacturer. We have pivoted away from this business and have ceased selling the product since the first quarter
 of 2024. 

VELDONA
 Pet. VELDONA Pet is cytoprotein supplement formulated to address a variety of health issues in dogs and cats, including skin,
 gum, emotion, discomfort caused by allergies, eye, and weight-related issues. We currently market VELDONA Pet in Taiwan. 

From
time to time, we assess our development plan based on available resources and market dynamics. As of September 30, 2024, our current
pipeline of the products, which are under development, includes the following: 

VELDONA
 human and animal drugs. Our human drug pipeline include oral warts for HIV seropositive patients, Sj gren s syndrome
 common cold, and influenza We have conducted Phase 2 studies for these programs. Within the human drug pipeline, we are prioritizing
 HIV oral warts and Sj gren s syndrome. As of the third quarter of 2024, we are in the process of initiating clinical studies
 for HIV oral warts and Sj gren s syndrome in Taiwan. The United States Food and Drug Administration (the U.S. FDA have granted orphan drug designation for our VELDONA formulation as a potential treatment for oral warts in HIV-seropositive patients.
 In the second quarter of 2024 we announced a plan to initiate a clinical study for feline chronic gingivostomatitis (FCGS), a cat
 oral disease, as an effort to explore VELDONA s opportunity as an animal drug. We enrolled our first subject for FCGS during
 the third quarter of 2024. 

21 

VOC
 POCT Ainos Flora . Ainos Flora, powered by AI Nose, is intended to perform a non-invasive test for female vaginal health
 and certain common STIs within a few minutes. A companion app is also being developed that aims to enable users to conveniently manage
 test results. We believe Ainos Flora can provide connected, convenient, discreet, rapid testing in a point-of-care setting. We are
 conducting clinical study in Taiwan and exploring strategic opportunities to commercialize the product. To further optimize the product
 for at-home testing, we are developing a next generation Ainos Flora device that implements compute unified device architecture (CUDA),
 a parallel computing platform for accelerated computing on graphical processing units. 

VOC
 platform NISD co-development. We are co-developing a VOC sensing platform with Nisshinbo Micro Devices Inc. NISD and Taiwan Inabata Sangyo Co. Taiwan Inabata ). The platform under development is intended to be used in applications
 including telehealth, automotive, industrial, and environmental safety. We are developing a VOC POCT solution for the elderly market
 and a solution for sensing VOCs in the industrial market. 

VOC
 POCT Ainos Pen. The device is intended to be a cloud-connected, multi-purpose, portable breath analyzer that is intended
 to monitor health conditions within minutes, powered by AI Nose. We expect consumers to be empowered to share test results with their
 physicians through in-person and telehealth medical consultations. 

VOC
 POCT CHS430. The CHS430 device, powered by AI Nose, is intended to provide non-invasive testing for ventilator-associated
 pneumonia within few minutes, as compared to current standard of care invasive culture tests that typically take more than two days
 to provide results. 

Synthetic
 RNA SRNA ). We plan develop a SRNA technology platform in Taiwan with a long-term goal of developing next-generating
 precision treatments and rapid tests. 

An
integral part of our operating strategy is to create multiple revenue streams through commercializing our product portfolio and leveraging
our intellectual property patents. Our near-term development plans encompass advancing our flagship VOC POCT candidate, Ainos Flora,
and our co-development programs. At the same time, we will advance clinical studies and actively pursue the out-licensing of VELDONA
human drug candidates. 

We
continue to strengthen our intellectual properties. During the third quarter of 2024, we have licensed additional patents from Taiwan
Carbon Nano Technology Corporation (TCNT), our shareholder and product developer, as an effort to bolster our AI Nose and POCT technologies.
For VELDONA, we secured a Taiwan invention patent titled METHOD AND COMPOSITION OF TREATMENT OR PREVENTION OF CORONAVIRUS INFECTION 
and we have filed for global patent protection under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) for this patent. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had available cash and cash equivalents of 5,156,606. We anticipate business revenues and further potential
financial support from external sources to fund our operations over the next twelve months. We have based this estimate on assumptions
that may prove to be incorrect, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect. See Liquidity and
Capital Resources for additional information. To finance our continuing operations, we will need to raise additional capital,
which cannot be assured. 

Our
operating revenue previously came from the sale of COVID-19 test kits in Taiwan under emergency use authorization, since the expiration
of EUA to TCNT, the company ceased the sale of the Ainos COVID-19 antigen rapid test kits in first quarter of 2024. The company began
to generate sales revenue from VELDONA Pet in the third quarter of 2023. In Taiwan, we are primarily marketing VELDONA Pet on certain
e-commerce platforms. 

We
believe that post COVID-19, consumers have become increasingly familiar with at-home tests. Moving forward, people may seek additional
at-home tests to manage other infections as quickly as possible. Home self-testing has become increasingly available for other infections
such as vaginal infections or STIs. We believe this new user behavior, supported by a variety of telehealth platforms, will facilitate
consumer adoption of our other POCT product candidates.

When excluding these non-cash cost, cost of revenue was 547 in Q3 2024 compared to 66,158 in Q3 2023. 

Gross
loss from product sales in Q3 2024 was 547 as compared to 63,384 gross loss from product sales in Q3 2023. The decrease in gross loss
was due to low sales volume for newly launched products, and a reduced cost of revenue. 

When
excluding these non-cash costs, gross loss decreased to 547 in Q3 2024 compared to 41,669 gross loss in Q3 2023. 

Research
and Development (R D) Expenses 

R D
expenses in Q3 2024 and Q3 2023 were 2,022,244 and 1,710,265, respectively. The increase of 311,979 (18 was due to increased expenses
associated with co-research for technology and product, as well as staffing expenditures (including share-based compensation), which
were offset by a decrease in professional expense. We expect that our R D expenses related to clinical trials will continue to grow
as we further develop VOC POCT and VELDONA drug candidates and increase the pace of clinical trials previously delayed during the COVID-19
pandemic. 

23 

The
share-based compensation expense and the depreciation and amortization expense in Q3 2024 and Q3 2023 were 1,305,461 and 1,263,665,

Revenues,
Cost and Gross Loss 

The
Company reported 20,729 and 102,208 in revenue in first nine months 2024 and first nine months 2023, respectively, from product sales
of VELDONA pet cytoprotein supplements and Ainos COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test Kits in Taiwan respectively. The Company launched its VELDONA
pet cytoprotein supplement products in the third quarter of 2023; due to the expiration of EUA, the company ceased the sale of the Ainos
COVID-19 antigen rapid test kits in the first quarter of 2024. 

The
cost of revenue related to product sales in first nine months 2024 was 52,674 compared to 244,538 in first nine months 2023. The
decrease in cost of revenue was due to the decrease in sales volume . 

The
share-based compensation expense and the depreciation expense for manufacturing in first nine months 2024 and first nine months 2023
were 9,032 and 70,069, respectively. When excluding these non-cash cost, cost of revenue decreased to 43,642 in first nine months
2024 compared to 174,469 in first nine months 2023. 

Gross
loss from product sales in first nine months 2024 was 31,945 as compared to 142,330 gross loss from product sales in first nine months
2023. The decrease in gross loss was due to low sales volume for newly launched products, and a lower cost of revenue. 

When
excluding these non-cash costs, gross loss decreased to 22,913 in first nine months 2024 compared to 72,261 gross loss in first nine
months 2023. 

Research
and Development (R D) Expenses 

R D
expenses in first nine months 2024 and first nine months 2023 were 6,085,648 and 5,080,335, respectively. The increase of 1,005,313
(20 was due to increased expenses associated with co-research for technology and product and staffing expenditures (including share-based
compensation), which were offset by a decrease in professional expense. We expect that our R D expenses related to clinical trials
will continue to grow as we further develop VOC POCT and VELDONA drug candidates and increase the pace of clinical trials previously
delayed during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The
share-based compensation expense and the depreciation and amortization expense in first nine months 2024 and first nine months 2023 were
 3,866,581 and 3,669,081, respectively. When excluding these non-cash expenses, R D expenses increased to 2,219,067 in first nine
months 2024 from 1,411,254 in first nine months 2023. 

Selling,
General and Administrative (SG A) Expenses 

SG A
expenses were 3,090,056 and 2,282,631 in first nine months 2024 and first nine months 2023, respectively, reflecting an increase of
 807,425 (35 due to a significant increase in staffing expenditures (including share-based compensation) and professional expenses,
which were offset by a decrease in public relations and investor relations fees and D O insurance expenses. RSUs granted to officers
and employees of the Company require a service period of 3 years and therefore, the total amount of the compensation expense was amortized
over the service period. 

The
share-based compensation expense and the depreciation and amortization expense in first nine months 2024 and first nine months 2023 were
 1,053,642 and 597,429, respectively. When excluding these non-cash expenses, SG A expenses increased to 2,036,414 in first nine
months 2024 compared to 1,685,202 in first nine months 2023.

Operating
Loss 

The
Company s operating loss was 9,207,649 and 7,505,296 in first nine months 2024 and first nine months 2023, respectively, reflecting
a 1,702,353 (23 increase in operating loss between the reporting periods. We incurred a gross loss in product sales. We continued
to invest resources to execute our growth strategy and product roadmap to improve our profitability. 

Interest
Expense and Issuance Cost of Convertible Note 

In
first nine months 2024, interest expense was 432,097 compared to 93,852 in first nine months 2023. The increase in interest expense
was due to accrued interest for convertible notes issued in May 2024 . 

On
January 23, 2024, the Company received an Increased Funding Amount and incurred an issuance cost including investor and placement agent
fees, as well as legal fees. 308,336 of the issuance cost was recognized for the amendment of funding received and closed by the Company. 

Net
Loss 

Net
loss was 10,209,149 in first nine months 2024 compared to 7,846,048 in first nine months 2023, resulting in a 2,363,101 (30 increase
in net loss attributable to our shareholders of common stock. The net loss was due to an expanding operating expense. We continued to
invest resources to execute our growth strategy and product roadmap to improve our profitability. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had available cash of 5,156,606 and 1,885,628, respectively. 

The
following table summarizes our cash flow during the nine months period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Operating
activities: 

Cash
used in operating activities increased by 1,622,282 during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first, nine months of 2023.
Our net loss for the first nine months of 2024 increased by 2,363,101 primarily due to increase of operating expenses. The operating
cash outflow as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities was mainly attributable to: 

Non-cash
 expenses including share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, loss on inventory write-downs, issuance cost of secured
 convertible note, and change in fair value of senior secured convertible note increased approximately by 794,700; 

Working
 capital injected into accounts receivable, inventories and other current assets decreased by approximately 112,500; and 

Working
 capital injected into accrued expenses, operating lease liabilities, contract liabilities and other current and long-term liabilities
 increased by approximately 58,500. 

26 

Investing
activities 

Cash
used for investing activities were 138,577 and 117,528 during the first nine months of 2024 and the first nine months of 2023, respectively.
The increase was due to increase in refundable deposits and other noncurrent assets offset by decrease in purchase of property and equipment. 

Financing
activities 

Cash
provided by financing activities were 8,295,746 and 4,023,974 during the first nine months of 2024 and the first nine months of 2023,
respectively. The 4,271,772 increase was primarily reflected by the following: 

Repayment
 of convertible notes and other notes payable increased by 795,728; 

Proceeds
 from convertible notes and other notes payable financing increased by 4,875,000; and 

Payments
 of issuance cost of senior secured convertible note measured at fair value decreased by 192,500. 

As
disclosed in Note 5 (Convertible Notes Payable and Other Notes Payable), to our accompanying condensed financial statements we received
 875,000 in proceeds from the Lind Note transaction in January 2024. 

As
disclosed in Note 5 (Convertible Notes Payable and Other Notes Payable), to our accompanying condensed financial statements we received
 9,000,000 in proceeds from the ASE Note transaction in May 2024. 

As
disclosed in Note 5 (Convertible Notes Payable and Other Notes Payable), to our accompanying condensed financial statements we repaid
 1,439,754 in cash to retired senior secured convertible notes from the LIND Note transaction in August 2024. 

As
disclosed in Note 5 (Convertible Notes Payable and Other Notes Payable), to our accompanying condensed financial statements we repaid
 42,000 to retire the i2China Note transaction in August 2024. 

In
the near-term, we expect an increase in the pace of clinical trial spending to advance our VOC POCT and VELDONA drug candidates and expect
to invest more in R D activities. We may also increase our sales and marketing efforts. 

The
Company anticipates that cash reserves, business revenues, and potential debt financing through convertible and non-convertible notes
will fund the Company s operations over the next twelve months. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts
to make the Company profitable. If those efforts are not successful, the Company may raise additional capital through the issuance of
equity securities, debt financings or other sources to further implement its business plan. However, if such financing is not available
when needed and at adequate levels, the Company will need to reevaluate its operating plan. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Significant Management Estimates 

Our
management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our unaudited condensed
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States,
or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. 

We
evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to inventory valuation, useful lives of property and equipment, valuation
of stock option, warrants and convertible note, and impairment testing of intangible assets, on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates
on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual
results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

There
have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates
disclosed in Management s Discussion and Analysis - Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Management Estimates 
of our 2023 Annual Report, except for those accounting subjects discussed in the Notes, if any, to the unaudited condensed financial
statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
