 OVERVIEW 
 GameStop Corp. GameStop, we, us, our, or the Company ), a Delaware corporation established in 1996, is a leading specialty retailer offering games and entertainment products through its thousands of stores and ecommerce platforms. 
 We operate our business in four geographic segments: United States, Canada, Australia and Europe. Our fiscal year is composed of the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to the last day of January. Fiscal 2024 consists of 52 weeks ending February 1, 2025 ("fiscal 2024"). Fiscal 2023 consisted of 53 weeks ended on February 3, 2024. All six month periods presented herein contain 26 weeks. All references to years, quarters and months relate to fiscal periods rather than calendar periods. The discussion and analysis of our results of operations refers to continuing operations unless otherwise noted. Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with the major portion of the net sales realized during the fourth quarter, which includes the holiday selling season. 
 
 BUSINESS PRIORITIES 
 GameStop is following a strategic plan to fully leverage its unique position and brand recognition in gaming through a new phase of transformation. Our strategic plan is designed to optimize our core business and achieve profitability. 
 GameStop is actively focused on the below objectives: 
 Establish Omnichannel Retail Excellence. We aim to be the leading destination for games and entertainment products through our stores and ecommerce platforms. To accomplish this, we are taking steps to ensure we are a fast and convenient solution for our customers. This includes increased product availability across all channels, faster fulfillment through ship from store offerings, and a further improved customer service experience. 
 Achieve Profitability. During fiscal 2023, we continued to optimize our cost structure to align with our current and anticipated future needs. We will continue to focus on cost containment, including closing underperforming stores, as we look to operate with increased efficiency. 
 Leverage Brand Equity to Support Growth. GameStop has many strengths and assets, including strong household brand recognition and a significant store network. 
 We believe these efforts are important aspects of our continued business to enable long-term value creation for our shareholders. 
 As part of our efforts to achieve sustained profitability, we continue to evaluate our international assets and operations, to determine their strategic and financial fit and to eliminate redundancies and underperforming assets. During fiscal 2023, we exited our operations in Ireland, Switzerland, and Austria. 
 We have also initiated a comprehensive store portfolio optimization review which involves identifying stores for closure based on many factors, including an evaluation of current market conditions and individual store performance. While this review is ongoing and a specific set of stores has not been identified for closure, we anticipate that it may result in the closure of a larger number of stores than we have closed in the past few years. 
 While we expect our cost containment efforts to yield reductions in selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses in the long term, we have incurred and may continue to incur non-recurring costs related to these efforts in the short term.

The Board anticipates that such investments will align the interests of the Company with the interests of related parties because it places the personal resources of such directors at risk in substantially the same manner as resources of the Company in connection with investment decisions made by the Investment Committee on behalf of the Company.

 Interest Income, net 
 During the three and six months ended August 3, 2024, we recognized net interest income of 39.5 million and 54.4 million, respectively, compared to net interest income of 11.6 million and 21.3 million for the three and six months ended July 29, 2023. 
 The impact is primarily attributable to interest income increasing as a result of higher returns on invested cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as return on cash received from the issuance and sale of shares of our common stock from the ATM Offering. 
 Income Tax 
 We recognized income tax expense of 2.7 million for the three months ended August 3, 2024 compared to an income tax benefit of 0.2 million for the three months ended July 29, 2023. Our effective income tax rate was 15.4 for the three months ended August 3, 2024 compared to 6.7 for the three months ended July 29, 2023. 
 Our effective income tax rate for the three months ended August 3, 2024, as well as the three months ended July 29, 2023, are primarily due to the recognition of tax benefits on certain current period losses, partially offset by forecasted income taxes due in certain jurisdictions in which we operate. 
 We recognized income tax benefit of 0.7 million for the six months ended August 3, 2024 compared to an income tax benefit of 0.3 million for the six months ended July 29, 2023. Our effective income tax rate was 3.8 for the six months ended August 3, 2024 compared to 0.6 for the six months ended July 29, 2023.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities 
 August 3, 2024 July 29, 2023 February 3, 2024 Cash and cash equivalents 4,193.1 894.7 921.7 Marketable securities 11.1 300.0 277.6 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities 4,204.2 1,194.7 1,199.3 
 Sources of Liquidity; Uses of Capital 
 Our principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations, cash on hand, and borrowings from the capital markets, which include our revolving credit facilities. As of August 3, 2024, we had total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents on hand of 4,193.1 million, marketable securities of 11.1 million, and an additional 244.1 million of effective available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities. 
 Our cash and cash equivalents are carried at fair value and consist primarily of cash, money market funds, cash deposits with commercial banks, U.S. government bonds and notes, and highly rated direct short-term instruments that mature in 90 days or less. 
 Our marketable securities are carried at fair value and include investments in certain highly-rated short-term government notes, government bills, and time deposits. Such investments with an original maturity in excess of 90 days and less than one year are classified as marketable securities. 
 As of August 3, 2024, the investment portfolios' aggregate balance was 11.1 million, all of which are recognized in marketable securities . See Item 1, Part I, "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements", Note 4 , "Fair Value Measurements," for additional information. 
 On an ongoing basis, we evaluate and consider certain strategic operating alternatives, including divestitures, restructuring or dissolution of unprofitable business segments, uses for our excess cash, as well as equity and debt financing alternatives that we believe may enhance stockholder value. The nature, amount and timing of any strategic operational change, or financing transactions that we might pursue will depend on a variety of factors, including, as of the applicable time, our available cash and liquidity and operating performance; our commitments and obligations; our capital requirements; limitations imposed under our credit arrangements; and overall market conditions.

 On December 5, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a new Investment Policy. Subsequently, on March 21, 2024, the 
 Board of Directors amended the new Investment Policy. See "Part I, Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Investments for more information.

 Some of our vendors have requested and may continue to request credit support collateral for our inventory purchase obligations and the levels of such collateral will depend on a variety of factors including our inventory purchase levels, available payment terms for inventories, availability of borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, favorable credit terms and costs of providing collateral.

After giving effect to the termination, our principal sources of liquidity will be cash from operations and cash on hand. 
 Separate from the 2026 Revolver, we maintain uncommitted facilities with certain lenders that provide for the issuance of letters of credit and bank guarantees, at times supported by cash collateral. As of August 3, 2024, we had letters of credit and other bank guarantees outstanding in the amount of 9.7 million outside of the 2026 Revolver.
