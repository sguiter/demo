 Promotional (Billback) Allowances 
 The Company s promotional allowance programs with its distributors or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business (variable consideration). These agreements provide for one or more of the arrangements described below and are of varying duration. The Company s billbacks are calculated based on various programs with distributors and retail customers, and accruals are established for the Company s anticipated liabilities. These accruals are based on agreed upon terms as well as the Company s historical experience with similar programs and require management s judgment with respect to estimating consumer participation and distributor and retail customer performance levels. Differences between estimated and actual promotional and other allowances are recognized in the period such differences are determined. 
 Promotional allowances are recorded as reductions to revenue and primarily include consideration given to the Company s distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to the following: 
 discounts from list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by retailers; 
 reimbursements given to distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products; 
 the Company s agreed share of fees given to distributors and/or directly to retailers for certain advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities; 
 the Company s agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers, club stores and/or wholesalers; 
 incentives provided to distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined volume goals or other incentive targets; 
 discounted products; 
 contractual fees paid to distributors related to sales made directly by the Company to certain customers that fall within the distributors sales territories; and 
 contractual fees given to distributors for items sold below defined pricing targets.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, promotional allowance included as a reduction of revenue was million a nd million, respectively.

 million in multiple tranches to facilitate the Company s transition of certain distribution rights to Pepsi. The Company received million from Pepsi that were contractually restricted to be used only to pay termination fees due to other distributors; any excess cash received over amounts due to other distributors was required to be refunded to Pepsi. During 2023, million of such funds were refunded to Pepsi. As of and after December 31, 2023, there was no refund liability owed to Pepsi. 
 On March 23, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Distribution Agreement with Pepsi, pursuant to which the Company will provide Pepsi with an incentive program designed to incentivize and compensate Pepsi for its continued focus on and actions to support the Company. These incentives are accounted for as promotional allowances and recorded as a reduction to revenue. 
 License Agreement 
 In January 2019, the Company entered into a license and repayment of investment agreement with Qifeng. Under the agreement, Qifeng was granted the exclusive license rights to manufacture, market and commercialize Celsius branded products in China. The term of the agreement is years, with annual royalty fees due from Qifeng after the end of each calendar year. The royalty fees are based on a percentage of Qifeng s sales of Celsius branded products; however, the fees are fixed for the first of the agreement, totaling approximately million combined, and then are subject to annual guaranteed minimums over the remaining term of the agreement. 
 Under the agreement, the Company granted Qifeng exclusive license rights and provides ongoing support in product development, brand promotion and technical expertise. The ongoing support is integral to the exclusive licensing rights; therefore, the license and the support represent a combined, single performance obligation. The transaction price consists of the guaranteed minimums and the variable royalty fees, all of which are allocated to the single performance obligation. 
 The Company uses the passage of time to measure progress towards satisfying its performance obligation because of its ongoing efforts in providing the exclusive license rights, including providing continuous access, updates and support, to product development, brand promotion and technical expertise.

 ) ) Note receivable-current-net 
 Effective January 1, 2019, the Company entered into two separate economic agreements relating to the commercialization of Celsius products in China (i.e., the Qifeng exclusive license rights agreement and the Qifeng repayment of investment agreement). See Note 4. Revenue for information regarding the license agreement with Qifeng. 
 In addition to the license agreement, Qifeng agreed to repay, over a period, the marketing investments made by Celsius into the China market through 2018. The Note required annual principal and interest payments on March 31 of each year, with the final payment scheduled for 2024. In February 2024, the Company amended the Note and extended the final maturity date to December 31, 2024. The Note is recorded at amortized cost less an allowance for expected credit losses. Interest income generated from the Note is included in the financial statement line item Interest income on note receivable in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. 
 The Company assesses the Note by considering the probability that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled principal and interest payments based on historical experience of Qifeng s ability to pay, the current economic environment, forward-looking information and other factors. As evidence of solvency for the Note, a stock certificate in Celsius Holdings, Inc. representing shares owned by an affiliate under common control of Qifeng is held at a brokerage account. A letter of guarantee was executed with several restrictions regarding their shares. In particular, it was agreed that the stock would not be sold or transferred without the prior written consent from Celsius. Additional restrictions and agreements include that a statement of account will be provided to Celsius on a quarterly basis to confirm and validate the existence of the remaining shares.

 million shares of non-voting Series A Preferred Stock to Pepsi. The shares accounted for approximately of the Company s outstanding common stock on the date of issuance, on an if-converted method. The purchase agreement (the "Purchase Agreement"), pursuant to which Pepsi acquired the Series A Preferred Stock, grants Pepsi the right to designate a nominee for election to the Company s Board of Directors (the "Board"), provided that Pepsi meets certain ownership requirements. 
 Pepsi provided the Company million in cash under the Transition Agreement in 2022. This amount was used to settle termination fees with former distributors, and any excess cash was contractually restricted and due back to Pepsi. During 2023, million of such funds were refunded to Pepsi. Amounts received pursuant to the Transition Agreement relating to the costs associated with terminating the Company s prior distributors were accounted for as deferred revenue and are being recognized ratably over the year term of the Distribution Agreement. Unamortized deferred revenues (current and non-current) are included as separate line items on the consolidated balance sheets. 
 On August 1, 2022, the Company issued Series A Preferred Stock with a fair value of million for an issuance price of million and recorded the million excess as deferred costs on the consolidated balance sheets (see Note 13. Mezzanine Equity ). Costs are being amortized over the year term of the Distribution Agreement and are recorded as an offset to revenue. Unamortized deferred other costs (current and non-current) are included as separate line items on the consolidated balance sheets.

On August 1, 2022, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company issued all of the authorized Series A Preferred Stock to Pepsi for stated cash consideration aggregating million, excluding

 million, or per share. Accordingly, the Series A Preferred Stock was recorded at that amount, net of issuance costs of million, in the Company s consolidated balance sheets, and consolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity and mezzanine equity. 
 The Company engaged a third-party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair value of the approximately million shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued on August 1, 2022. The valuation of the Series A Preferred Stock represents a non-recurring fair value measurement. The Company used a Monte Carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of the Series A Preferred Stock on August 1, 2022. The Monte Carlo simulation utilized multiple level 2 input variables to determine the value of the Series A Preferred Stock including a volatility rate of , risk free interest rate of , dividend rate, the closing price of the Company s common stock on the issuance date of (pre-split), a debt discount rate of and a discount for lack of marketability attributed to the registration period of the underlying stock. The selected historical volatility was based on Celsius and a certain peer group. The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. STRIPS Rate with a corresponding term as of issuance date. The dividend rate is consistent with the provisions of the Series A Preferred Stock and with the Company s past payments of dividends made in cash. The debt discount rate was based on estimated credit analysis and corresponding market yields as of the issuance date. The Company applied a nominal discount for lack of marketability with respect to the assumed registration period of the underlying shares. 
 Mezzanine Classification 
 The Series A Preferred Stock is redeemable in the event of a change in control as defined in the Series A Certificate. ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ("ASC 480"), specifically ASC 480-10-S99-3A, requires preferred securities that are redeemable for cash or other assets to be classified outside of permanent equity if they are redeemable (i) at a fixed or determinable price on a fixed or determinable date, (ii) at the option of the holder, or (iii) upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the issuer. Preferred securities that are mandatorily redeemable are required to be classified by the issuer as liabilities whereas under ASC 480 an issuer should classify a preferred security whose redemption is contingent on an event not entirely in control of the issuer as mezzanine equity. The Series A is not considered mandatorily redeemable other than in the event of a change of control, and a change in control is not solely in control of the Company. Accordingly, the Company determined that mezzanine treatment is appropriate for the Series A and has presented it as such in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity and mezzanine equity, as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Pepsi, together with its affiliates, has certain rights and is also subject to various restrictions with respect to its ownership of the Company s outstanding common shares on an as-converted basis, through purchases of the Company s common stock in the open market and the accumulation of PIK dividends. Additionally, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Pepsi has the right to designate one nominee for election to the Board so long as Pepsi (together with its affiliates) beneficially owns at least approximately million shares of the Company s outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis. Notwithstanding that the Series A is not currently convertible into common stock, the Purchase Agreement provides that Pepsi is deemed to beneficially own the underlying shares of common stock for purposes of its rights under the Purchase Agreement. In August 2022, the Company expanded the number of Board seats in connection with the election of a Pepsi representative to the Board. 
 Liquidation Preference 
 The Series A ranks, with respect to distribution rights and rights on liquidation, winding-up and dissolution, (i) senior and in priority of payment to the Company s common stock, (ii) senior to any class or series of capital stock of the Company expressly designated as ranking junior to the Series A, (iii) on parity with any class or series of capital stock of the Company expressly designated as ranking on parity with the Series A, and (iv) junior to any class or series of capital stock of the Company expressly designated as ranking senior to the Series A. The aggregate liquidation preference of the Series A was million as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Voting 
 The Series A confers no voting rights, except as otherwise required by applicable law, and with respect to matters that adversely change the powers, preferences, privileges, rights or restrictions given to the Series A or provided for its benefit, or would result in securities that would be senior to or pari passu with the Series A. As described above, Pepsi has a contractual right to representation on the Board, subject to maintaining certain ownership thresholds.

Regular Dividends accrue on each share of Series A at the rate of per annum, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Series A Certificate. In addition to such quarterly Regular Dividends, shares of Series A also entitle the holder to participate in any dividends paid on the Company s common stock on an as-converted basis. There were no cumulative undeclared dividends on the Series A at September 30, 2024. There were no dividends issued to common stockholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. 
 Redemption 
 Subject to certain conditions set forth in the Series A Certificate, Series A may be redeemed at a price per share of Series A equal to the sum of (i) the stated value of such share of Series A as of the applicable redemption date, plus (ii) without duplication, all accrued and unpaid dividends previously added to the stated value of such share of Series A, and all accrued and unpaid dividends per share of Series A through such redemption date (the Redemption Price ). 
 Company s Optional Redemption 
 At any time from and after the earlier of (i) August 1, 2029, if the ten-day volume weighted average price of the Company s common stock (the Ten-Day VWAP does not exceed the conversion price on the date immediately prior to the date the Company delivers a redemption notice to the holders, and (ii) the cancellation of the Distribution Agreement by the Company, the Company has the right to redeem all (and not less than all) of the then-outstanding shares of Series A at the Redemption Price. In the event of the Company's optional redemption, the Company shall affect such redemption by paying the entire Redemption Price on or before the date that is thirty days after the delivery of the Company s redemption notice and by redeeming all the shares of Series A on such date. 
 Change in Control Redemption 
 In the event of a change in control, as defined by the following scenarios, the Company (or its successor) shall redeem all (and not less than all) of the then-issued and outstanding shares of Series A: (i) a sale or transfer, directly or indirectly, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company in any transaction or series of related transactions (other than sales in the ordinary course of business); (ii) any merger, consolidation or reorganization of the Company with or into any other entity or entities as a result of which the holders of the Company s outstanding capital stock (on a fully-diluted basis) immediately prior to the merger, consolidation or reorganization no longer represent at least a majority of the voting power of the surviving or resulting Company or other entity; or (iii) any sale or series of sales, directly or indirectly, beneficially or of record, of shares of the Company s capital stock by the holders thereof which results in any person or group of affiliated persons owning capital stock holding more than of the Company's voting power. 
 Upon a change in control and redemption, each Series A holder will receive, an amount equal to the greater of (A) the Redemption Price in cash, or (B) the cash and/or other assets (including securities) such holder would have received if each share of Series A were converted into a number of shares of common stock equal to the then-applicable conversion ratio and participated in such transaction resulting in such change of control as of the close of business on the business day immediately prior to the effective date of such transaction. 
 If the Company or its successor shall not have sufficient funds legally available under the Nevada law governing distributions to stockholders to redeem all outstanding shares of Series A, then the Company shall (A) redeem, pro rata among the holders, a number of shares of Series A equal to the number of shares of Series A that can be redeemed with the maximum amount legally available for the redemption, and (B) redeem all remaining shares of Series A not redeemed because of the foregoing limitations at the applicable change of control Redemption Price as soon as practicable after the Company (or its successor) is able to make such redemption out of assets legally available for the purchase of such shares of Series A. The inability of the Company (or its successor) to make a redemption payment for any reason shall not relieve the Company (or its successor) from its obligation to affect any required redemption when, as and if permitted by applicable law.

 per annum. From such fifteenth-month anniversary to the thirtieth-month anniversary of such redemption date, the dividend rate with respect to such unredeemed share will automatically increase to per annum. After such thirtieth-month anniversary of such redemption date, the dividend rate with respect to any such unredeemed share will automatically increase to per annum, in each case until such share is duly redeemed or converted. 
 Conversion 
 The shares of Series A may be converted into shares of the Company s common stock pursuant to the Series A Certificate either at the option of the Company or subject to an automatic conversion as discussed below. The Series A was issued with a conversion price of which is potentially subject to adjustment pursuant to the Series A Certificate. The conversion ratio is calculated as the quotient of (a) the sum of (x) the stated value of such share of Series A as of the applicable conversion date, plus (y) all accrued and unpaid dividends previously added to the stated value of such share of Series A, and without duplication, all accrued and unpaid dividends per share of Series A through the applicable conversion date; divided by (b) the conversion price as of the conversion date. As of September 30, 2024, the conversion ratio of the Series A into common was one-for-fifteen. At September 30, 2024, approximately million shares of the Company s common stock were issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Series A was not probable of becoming redeemable, as the most likely method of settlement is through conversion which is likely to occur before the holder's right to request redemption becomes exercisable. 
 Company Optional Conversion 
 At any time from and after August 1, 2029, provided the Ten-Day VWAP immediately prior to the date the Company delivers a conversion notice to the holders of Series A exceeds the conversion price, the Company may elect to convert all, but not less than all, of the outstanding shares of Series A into shares of the Company s common stock.

 The total fair value of shares vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately million and million, respectively. Unre cognized compensation expense related to outstanding restricted stock units to employees and directors as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 was million and million, respectively, and is expected to be expensed over the next years. 
 Performance-based Stock Awards 
 
 PSUs are awards that give the holder the right to receive one share of common stock for each PSU upon meeting performance or market-based vesting conditions. These conditions typically include the attainment of specific metrics over a defined period. The fair value of the PSUs is determined based on either the grant date fair value for performance metrics or using a Monte Carlo simulation for market based awards. The Company recognizes expense if the metrics are probable of being achieved and expensed using either a straight line or an accelerated attribution model. Additionally, the Company recognizes compensation expense for non-employees in the same manner and periods as though cash had been paid for services received. 
 
 The Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved certain PSUs under the 2015 Plan, with each PSU initially equivalent in value to share of Celsius' common stock. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2022, PSUs with an aggregate grant date fair value of million, were issued to certain employees. These awards included an immediate vesting of of the shares as well as specific performance-based metrics to be met in year one and year two of the issuance. These awards were fully vested, using the accelerated attribution method according to ASC 718, during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Approximately one-third of the PSUs were valued at per PSU based on the Company's common stock price on the grant date, and the financial targets for vesting are based on the Company's achievement of certain revenue metrics. The Company recognizes the grant-date fair value of these PSUs as stock-based compensation expense ratably over the vesting period based on the number of awards expected to vest at each reporting date. The remaining PSUs were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model. This model incorporates assumptions such as the risk-free interest rate based on zero-coupon yields implied by U.S. Treasury

 million in compensatory damages. On April 27, 2023, the court denied the Company s post-trial motions which sought (i) dismissal of the case notwithstanding the verdict based on the plain language of the contracts at issue; (ii) in the alternative, granting a new trial; or (iii) in the alternative, reducing the award of damages to million, which reflects the Company s stock price on the date that the jury found the relevant revenue and sales benchmarks at issue were met. The judgment will accrue post-judgement interest at per year as of February 13, 2023. 
 The Company believes that the jury verdict is not supported by the facts of the case or applicable law, is the result of significant trial error, and there are strong grounds for appeal. The Company filed a notice of appeal to the Fourth District Court of Appeal for the State of Florida on February 21, 2023, which is currently proceeding. The Company intends to vigorously challenge the judgment through the appeal processes, and filed its initial brief on October 6, 2023. 
 The Company believes that the likelihood that the full amount of the judgment will be affirmed is not probable. The Company currently estimates a range of possible outcomes between million and million plus interest and has accrued a liability as of September 30, 2024, reflected in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets, at the low end of that range. The ultimate amount of the original judgement that the Company may be required to pay could be materially different than the amount the Company has accrued. The Company cannot predict or estimate the duration or ultimate outcome of this matter. 
 Commitments 
 The Company has entered into distribution agreements that provide for the payment of liquidated damages in the event that the Company terminates the distribution agreements without cause. Cause has been defined in various ways. If management makes the decision to terminate an agreement without cause, an estimate of expected damages is accrued, and an expense is recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses for the period in which termination was initiated. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had purchase commitments to third parties of million and million, respectively. The Company's purchase obligations are primarily related to third party suppliers and have arisen through the normal course of business. These obligations vary in terms and none are individually significant. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had long term contractual obligations aggregating to approximately million and million, respectively, which related primarily to suppliers, sponsorships, and other marketing activities.

 Business Overview 
 Celsius is a growing company in the functional energy drink category in the United States (U.S.) and internationally. We engage in the development, processing, marketing, sale, and distribution of functional energy drinks to a broad range of consumers. We provide differentiated products that offer clinically proven and innovative formulas meant to positively impact the lives of our consumers. Our brand has also proven to be attractive to a broad range of customers, including fitness enthusiasts. 
 Our flagship asset, CELSIUS , is marketed as a premium lifestyle and energy drink formulated to power active lifestyles. This product line comes in two versions, a 12-ounce ready-to-drink form and an on-the-go powder form. During 2023, we introduced a new CELSIUS Essentials line, available in 16-ounce cans. Our products are currently offered in major retail channels across the U.S., including conventional grocery, natural, convenience, fitness, mass market, vitamin specialty and e-commerce. Additionally, our products are currently offered in certain Canadian, European, Middle Eastern, and Asia-Pacific markets. 
 An integral part of our value proposition is our focus on the functional energy drink and liquid supplement category, ensuring our products have clear and proven benefits. This is why we invest in research and development from the start and utilize our proprietary MetaPlus formulation in our portfolio, a blend of ginger root, guarana seed extract, chromium, vitamins, and green tea extract. 
 During 2024, we have continued to develop our U.S. Pepsi relationship as well as expanding our international presence through the following arrangements: 
 In January 2024, we announced Pepsi as our exclusive distributor in Canada, as well as a new relationship with Lucozade Ribena Suntory Limited ("Suntory") to serve as our exclusive sales and distribution partner in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. 
 In March 2024, we entered into a definitive manufacturing, sales, and distribution agreement with Frucor Suntory Australia Pty Limited and Frucor Suntory New Zealand Limited (both part of the Suntory Group) to expand into the Australia and New Zealand markets. Sales under this arrangement are expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 In March 2024, we entered into an incentive program with Pepsi which is intended to better align our businesses as we look to grow and expand our product portfolio across the U.S. The ultimate impact of the incentive program on the Company's revenue and margin will be dependent upon achieving the intended outcomes of the program. 
 In April 2024, we entered into a definitive sales and distribution agreement with Orangina Schweppes France (part of the Suntory Group) to expand into France. Sales under this arrangement are expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 In August 2024, we entered into a definitive sales and distribution agreement with Schweppes Suntory Benelux SA (part of the Suntory Group) to expand into Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg. Sales under this arrangement are expected to begin in the first quarter of 2025. 
 We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 26, 2005. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, and on November 13, 2023, a three-for-one forward stock split of our common stock was made effective for stockholders of record at the close of business on such date. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenue 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenue was approximately 265.7 million, compared to 384.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue from our largest distributor declined 123.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period last year, which was primarily driven by inventory optimization. Concurrently, related retailer promotional allowances created revenue headwinds that would have otherwise been offset by proportional distributor sell-in during the quarter. 
 31 

European revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 16.2 million, compared to 11.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The revenue increase in Europe was predominantly driven by successful innovation launches. Asia-Pacific revenues contributed an additional 0.6 million. Other international markets generated approximately 1.8 million in revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The following table sets forth revenues by geographical location:

 Gross Profit 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit decreased by 71.9 million, or 37 , to 122.2 million, from 194.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit margin was 46 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease from 50 for the same period in 2023. The decrease in gross profit was due to promotional allowances, incentives, and other billbacks as a percentage of gross revenue. These programs are driven by consumer purchases and sales from our distributors into retail, neither of which correlated with the sales that we made to our distributors this quarter due to supply chain optimization conducted by our largest distributor. Although gross profit as a percentage of revenue was lower year over year, we did receive the benefit of lower outbound freight and materials as a percentage of gross revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period last year. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses totaled approximately 125.4 million, up 30 or 29.0 million from 96.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. 
 The increase in SG A expenses primarily consisted of: 
 a 17.5 million increase in marketing investments; 
 a 9.3 million increase in employee costs, reflecting our ongoing investments to support growth; and 
 a 2.2 million increase in other SG A expenses. 
 Other Income 
 Other income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 11.4 million, which reflects an increase of 4.4 million versus 7.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to greater interest income earned on cash held in our money market accounts. 
 Net (loss) Income Attributable to Common Stockholders 
 Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.6 million, resulting in basic loss per share of (0.00), based on a basic weighted average of 233.7 million shares outstanding. In comparison, for the three months ended September 30, 2023, net income attributable to common stockholders was 70.4 million, representing basic earnings per share of 0.30 based on a basic weighted average of 231.0 million shares outstanding. Diluted (loss) earnings per share was (0.00) and 0.30 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenue 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue was approximately 1,023.4 million compared to 970.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This growth was primarily driven by increased revenues in North America, which experienced continued gains in distribution points, shelf space, and SKUs per location, offset in part by inventory optimization from our largest distributor, increased macroeconomic headwinds, and a decline in growth in the total energy drink category. 
 European revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 47.1 million, which increased by 15.5 million or 49 from the same period in 2023. The revenue increase in Europe was predominantly driven by successful innovation launches. Asia-Pacific revenues contributed an additional 2.1 million. Other international markets generated approximately 5.2 million in revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The following table sets forth revenues by geographical location:

 Gross Profit 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit increased by 46.6 million, or 10 , to 513.5 million, from 466.9 million for the same period in 2023. Gross profit margins reflected an increase to 50 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 48 for the same period in 2023. Gross profit margin improvements resulted from decreases in raw and package material unit cost and reduced outbound freight cost as a percentage of revenue partially offset by increased promotional allowances as a percentage of revenue from the reduction in disproportionate distributor sell-in. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, SG A expenses totaled 339.3 million, up 31 or approximately 79.8 million from 259.5 million in the same quarter of 2023. 
 The increase in SG A expenses primarily consisted of: 
 a 56.0 million increase in marketing investments; 
 a 26.6 million increase in employee costs, reflecting our ongoing investments to support growth; and 
 a 2.8 million decrease in all other SG A expenses. 
 Other Income 
 Other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 31.0 million, which reflects an increase of 14.5 million versus 16.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to interest income earned on cash held in our money market accounts, partially offset by foreign exchange rate transaction loss. 
 33 

Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders 
 Net income attributable to common stockholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 131.0 million, representing basic earnings per share of 0.56 based on a basic weighted average of 233.2 million shares outstanding. In comparison, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net income attributable to common stockholders was 142.6 million, representing basic earnings per share of 0.62 based on a basic weighted average of 230.5 million shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share was 0.55 and 0.60 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 903.7 million and 756.0 million, respectively, and working capital of approximately 1,074.0 million and 928.3 million, respectively. 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and our existing cash balances. Please refer to Part 1, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of our 2023 Annual Report and Part II, Item 1A " Risk Factors " of this Report for specific risk factors that could have a material impact on our operations. We believe that our current cash resources are sufficient to fund our cash outflows for both our short and long-term cash needs. 
 Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, equipment purchases (including coolers), advances to certain of our co-packers, payments of accounts payable, and income taxes are expected to remain our principal recurring uses of cash and material cash requirements. 
 Cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 Cash flows provided by operating activities 
 Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled approximately 187.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which compares to 136.0 million of cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The approximately 51.2 million increase in operating cash generated is primarily driven by an increase in working capital, partially offset by a decrease in net income and higher tax payments. 
 Cash flows used in investing activities 
 Cash flows used in investing activities totaled approximately 21.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which compares to cash used in investing activities of 9.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to increased purchases of property and equipment, with purchases of approximately 18.0 million in the current year period versus 12.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and our purchase of a non-marketable equity security during the third quarter of 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, property and equipment purchases were partially offset by collections from our note receivable received from our China licensee of approximately 3.2 million. 
 Cash flows used in financing activities 
 Cash flows used in financing activities totaled 18.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which compares to cash used in financing activities of 18.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The main driver for cash used in financing activities for both periods was cash dividends paid on our outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, all of which is held by Pepsi. 
 
 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no off balance sheet arrangements. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting estimates are those that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Judgments and uncertainties may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies or estimates from those described in Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in our 2023 Annual report. 
 34 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 In the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. The principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which we are exposed are fluctuations in commodity and other input prices affecting the costs of our raw materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the costs of the price of aluminum cans, sucralose and other sweeteners, as well as other raw materials contained within our products). We generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. We are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities and other inputs because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. 
 We do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest rates and generally do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices. 
 There have been no material changes to the information regarding market risk provided in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk contained in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial and accounting officer) conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms adopted by the SEC, including to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date because of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below. 
 Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. Although our disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer evaluated whether our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at doing so, a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented if an individual desires to do so. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing conclusion, and notwithstanding the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below, management believes that the consolidated financial statements and related financial information included in this Report fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates presented, and for the periods ended on such dates, in conformity with U.S. GAAP and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. 
 We identified a material weakness as of December 31, 2023 in our internal control over financial reporting, which was not fully remediated as of September 30, 2024. A material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. We concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2023 and was not fully remediated as of September 30, 2024 with respect to the following processes as the result of the ineffective design and operation of business process level controls: (i) accounting for revenue recognition, (ii) accounting for promotional allowances, and (iii) accounting for inventories. 
 Management has reassessed the design of controls and modified its processes to remediate the control deficiencies that led to the material weakness, including but not limited to placing increased emphasis on appropriately designing and implementing effective business process level controls. This material weakness cannot be considered remediated until the applicable controls are designed and operating effectively for a sufficient period of time, as supported by management s testing results. 
 35 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have been implementing and will aggressively continue to implement changes to improve the control environment with respect to the business process level controls that led to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 discussed above. We anticipate the actions to be taken, and resulting process improvements, to generally strengthen our internal control over financial reporting and remediate the material weakness noted above. These remedial measures were considered changes to our internal control environment that had a material effect on our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 The information required by this Item is incorporated herein by reference to Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies in the consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1, of this Report. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 We face a variety of risks that are inherent in our business and our industry, including operational, legal, regulatory and product risks. Such risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, expectations and historical trends. Other than as set forth below, during the reporting period covered by this Report, there have been no material changes to our risk factors as set forth in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 Failure to successfully complete or manage strategic transactions can adversely affect our business. If we do not successfully integrate and manage our acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations, or if we are unable to realize a significant portion of the anticipated benefits of our joint ventures or strategic relationships, our financial results could suffer. 
 We regularly review and evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures, distribution agreements, divestitures, and other strategic transactions. The success of these transactions, is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to realize the full extent of the expected returns, benefits, cost savings or synergies as a result of a transaction, within the anticipated time frame, or at all; and receipt of necessary consents, clearances and approvals. 
 On November 1, 2024, we acquired substantially all of the equity interests of Big Beverages, a canned beverage manufacturer and co-packing partner of the Company. Acquisitions of businesses, brands or bottling operations may involve significant challenges and risks, and the expected benefits may take longer to realize than expected or may not be realized at all. Our business may also be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations, or if we are unable to consolidate operations. To the extent we integrate acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations, it is possible that we will not realize the expected benefits from any completed acquisition over the timeframe we expect, or at all, or that our existing operations will be adversely affected as a result of such acquisitions. Integrating the operations of acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations can be a difficult, costly and time-consuming process that involves a number of risks including, but not limited to, the integration of company cultures and management teams, retaining key employees and customers, increased exposure to certain governmental regulations and compliance requirements, increased costs, and use of resources. We may face difficulties in operating through new business models and/or supply chain models, or in new categories or territories, and challenges in extending Company controls (including internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, data protection and cybersecurity), policies and governance structures (including with respect to food safety and quality, occupational safety, and sustainability) to newly acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations, which may result in increased costs and negative publicity. The costs of achieving benefits from acquisitions could be higher than we expected. Therefore, the acquisition and integration of acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations may not contribute to our earnings as expected, we may not achieve profit margin targets when expected, or at all, and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic financial benefits of such transactions. 
 Other risks associated with acquisitions and any other strategic transactions that we may enter into include integrating manufacturing, distribution, sales, accounting, financial reporting and administrative support activities and information technology systems with our company or difficulties separating such personnel, activities and systems in connection with divestitures; operating through new business models or in new categories or territories; motivating, recruiting and retaining executives and key employees; conforming controls (including internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures) and policies (including with respect to environmental compliance, health and safety compliance and compliance with anti-bribery laws); retaining existing customers and consumers and attracting new customers and consumers; managing tax costs or inefficiencies; maintaining good relations with divested or refranchised businesses in our supply or sales chain; inability to offset loss of revenue associated with divested brands or businesses; managing the impact of business decisions or other actions or omissions of our joint venture partners that may have different interests than we do; operating through new business models or in new categories or territories; and other unanticipated problems or liabilities, such as contingent liabilities and litigation. Strategic transactions that are not successfully completed or managed effectively, or our failure to effectively manage the risks associated with such transactions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 
 36 

We rely on third-party co-packers to manufacture our products. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our co-packers or their ability to manufacture our products becomes constrained or unavailable to us, our business could suffer. 
 
 Until the recent acquisition of Big Beverages, we did not directly manufacture our products, but instead outsourced such manufacturing to third-party co-packers. We continue to outsource manufacturing of our products to third-party co-packers, and we have created a network model within North America that encompasses the utilization of co-packers and warehousing across each geographical area, as well as alternative warehousing and co-packing capacity, in order to reduce our exposure within each geographical area. These third-party co-packers may not be able to fulfill our demand as it arises or fail to meet our product specifications, could begin to charge rates that make using their services cost inefficient or may simply not be able to or willing to provide their services to us on a timely basis or at all. There could also be food safety concerns or other regulatory compliance issues with our third-party co-packers, which could require them to (temporarily or permanently) cease manufacturing product and/or necessitate destruction of product that they have already manufactured. In the event of any disruption or delay in production of product by our co-packers, whether caused by a rift in our relationship or the inability of our co-packers to manufacture our products as required, we would need to secure the services of alternative co-packers. We may be unable to procure alternative packing facilities at commercially reasonable rates or within a reasonably short time period, and any such transition could be costly. In such case, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected.

 Rule 10b5-1 Trading Arrangements 
 
 From time to time, certain of our executive officers and directors have, and we expect they will in the future, enter into, amend and terminate written trading arrangements pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act or otherwise.
