See Note 3 for further discussion of our letters of credit and associated security requirements. Short-term Investments We consider investments with original maturities of more than three months but less than twelve months to be short-term investments. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our short-term investments included U.S. Treasuries with original maturities of approximately four to six months. We intend to hold these investments until maturity and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investments prior to their maturity. The investments are stated at amortized costs, which approximates fair value due to their near-term maturities. All short-term investments are traded on active markets with quoted prices and represent Level 1 fair value measurements.

 federal income tax expense was recorded for our income as it was fully offset by the reversal of valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, as federal income tax benefit was recorded for our losses as a full valuation allowance was recorded against our net deferred tax assets generated during the periods. Income taxes recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, relate to state income taxes. Reserves for uncertain tax positions are recognized when we consider it more likely than not that additional tax will be due in excess of amounts reflected in our income tax returns, irrespective of whether or not we have received tax assessments. Interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions are recorded within income tax expense.

The new standard will be effective for us in the fourth quarter 2024. Early adoption of the new standard is permitted; however, we have not elected to early adopt the standard. The new standard is required to be applied using the retrospective transition method. We are assessing the effect that the new standard will have on our financial statement disclosures; however, adoption will not impact our Balance Sheet, Statement of Operations or Statement of Cash Flows. Income Taxes In the fourth quarter 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 Income Taxes - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , which requires enhanced disclosures related to rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information.

The new standard may be applied using either the prospective or retrospective transition method. We are assessing the effect of the new standard on our financial statement disclosures; however, adoption will not impact our Balance Sheet, Statement of Operations or Statement of Cash Flows.

 (2) We expect all of our performance obligations at September 30, 2024, to be recognized as revenue during 2024. Certain factors and circumstances could result in changes in the timing of recognition of our performance obligations as revenue and the amounts ultimately recognized. 

Contracts Assets and Liabilities The timing of customer invoicing and recognition of revenue using the POC method may occur at different times. Customer invoicing is generally dependent upon contractual billing terms, which could provide for customer payments in advance of performing the work, milestone billings based on the completion of certain phases of the work, or billings when services are provided. Revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed is reflected as contract assets on our Balance Sheet, or to the extent we have an unconditional right to the consideration, is reflected as contract receivables on our Balance Sheet. Amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized, and accrued contract losses, are reflected as contract liabilities on our Balance Sheet.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Credit Losses Our provision for bad debts and credit losses is included in other (income) expense, net on our Statement of Operations, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , was not significant. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized income of million and million, respectively, associated with revisions to our allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses. Our allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , was million and million, respectively. We had no significant write-offs or recoveries of previously recorded bad debts during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. See New Accounting Standards in Note 1 for discussion of our adoption of ASU 2016-13.

million. Changes in Project Estimates We determine the impact of changes in estimated margins on projects for a given period by calculating the amount of revenue recognized in the period that would have been recognized in a prior period had such estimated margins been forecasted in the prior period. The total impact of changes in estimated margins for a project as disclosed on a quarterly basis may be different from the applicable year-to-date impact due to the application of the POC method and the changing progress of the project at each period end. Such impacts may also be different when a project is commenced and completed within the applicable year-to-date period but spans multiple quarters. Changes in Estimates for 2024 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, individual projects with significant changes in estimated margins did not have a material net impact on our operating results. The status of projects in backlog at September 30, 2024, which have previously experienced material changes in estimates, is as follows: Seventy-Vehicle Ferry Project As discussed in our 2023 Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2023, we had completed, delivered and received final customer acceptance of our seventy-vehicle ferry. The warranty period for the vessel ended in the third quarter 2024. 

 Forty-Vehicle Ferry Projects As discussed in our 2023 Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2023, we had completed, delivered and received final customer acceptance of the first of two forty-vehicle ferries, and had substantially completed and delivered our second forty-vehicle ferry. During the first quarter 2024, we received final customer acceptance of the second ferry. The warranty period for the first vessel ended in the second quarter 2024 and the warranty period for the second vessel ends in the first quarter 2025. The second project would experience further losses if we incur unanticipated warranty costs on the second vessel. 

 As discussed in our 2023 Financial Statements, as a result of design deficiencies, we experienced rework, construction and commissioning challenges on the two ferries, resulting in previous cost increases and liquidated damages, and the previous need to fabricate a new hull for one of the vessels. Accordingly, during 2021, we submitted claims to our customer to recover the cost impacts of the design deficiencies. In accordance with contract requirements and North Carolina state law, in July 2024, we submitted our finalized claim to the customer for these cost and schedule impacts. In October 2024, the customer denied our claim, which cleared the way for us to litigate our claim. Accordingly, we have filed a lawsuit in North Carolina state court to have the claim decided before a judge. Our forecasts at September 30, 2024 do not reflect potential future benefits, if any, from the favorable resolution of the claim and we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in recovering previously incurred costs.

million during each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. See Note 4 for further discussion of the resolution of our MPSV Litigation. In addition, for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, significant changes in estimated margins on projects positively impacted operating results for our Fabrication Division by million, and negatively impacted operating results for our Shipyard Division by million and million, respectively. The changes in estimates were associated with the following: Fabrication Division Various Projects For each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, our operating results were positively impacted by million on projects, resulting primarily from increases in contract price due to favorable resolution of customer change orders. 

 Shipyard Division Seventy-Vehicle Ferry Project For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, our operating results were negatively impacted by million and million, respectively, from changes in estimates on our seventy-vehicle ferry project, associated primarily with increased materials and subcontracted services costs, duration related costs due to extensions of schedule and net reductions to contract price. The cost impacts were primarily due to delays in the receipt of certain equipment that required replacement and subcontractor delays. The contract price impacts were primarily due to a price reduction resulting from the required replacement of the vessel s propeller blades (discussed further below), offset partially by price increases due to favorable resolution of customer change orders and the customer s agreement to forego a portion of previously forecasted liquidated damages. 

 In connection with the delivery and commissioning of the vessel in the second quarter 2023, corrosion on the propeller blades was identified and the customer determined that replacement of the propeller blades will be required. The customer agreed to directly procure the new propeller blades and take responsibility for future installation of the blades once received. Further, the customer agreed to bear a portion of the cost of the new propeller blades, with the remainder borne by us through the aforementioned contract price reduction. Forty-Vehicle Ferry Projects For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, our operating results were negatively impacted by million and million, respectively, from changes in estimates on one of our forty-vehicle ferry projects, associated primarily with increased subcontracted services and duration related costs due to extensions of schedule, including forecast liquidated damages. The impacts were primarily due to delays in the receipt of certain equipment that required replacement and subcontractor delays. 

 Other Operating and Project Matters Fabrication Division Impacts As of December 31, 2023, we had finalized all claims associated with our property and equipment insurance coverages, and at December 31, 2023, we had total insurance receivables on our Balance Sheet of million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we received insurance payments of million and million, respectively, from our insurance carriers associated with interruptions to our operations and damage to buildings and equipment . The classification of insurance proceeds within our Statement of Cash Flows is based on our use or intended use of the proceeds. Proceeds used or intended to be used for repairs that are not deemed to be capital in nature, and proceeds associated with interruptions to our operations, are reflected within operating activities. Proceeds used or intended to be used for repairs that are deemed capital in nature, or proceeds in excess of repair costs, are reflected within investing activities. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded gains of million (all related to our business interruption coverage) and million (including million related to our business interruption coverage), respectively, related to the net impact of insurance recoveries and costs associated with damage previously caused by Hurricane Ida. The gains are included in other (income) expense, net on our Statement of Operations and are reflected within our Fabrication Division. Shipyard Division Impacts In addition to damage to our Houma Facilities, the storm resulted in damage to one of our forty-vehicle ferry projects , the multi-purpose supply vessels MPSV(s) and associated equipment that were previously in our possession and subject to our previous MPSV Litigation, and certain bulkheads where the vessels were moored. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded charges of million and million, respectively, related to costs associated with damage previously caused by Hurricane Ida. The charges are included in other (income) expense, net on our Statement of Operations and are reflected within our Shipyard Division. See Note 4 for further discussion of the resolution of our MPSV Litigation.

. The LC Facility provides for up to million of letters of credit, subject to our cash securitization of the letters of credit, and at September 30, 2024, we had million of outstanding letters of credit under the LC Facility. Commitment fees on the unused portion of the LC Facility are per annum and interest on outstanding letters of credit is per annum. See Note 4 for further discussion of our letters of credit and associated security requirements. Surety Bonds We issue surety bonds in the ordinary course of business to support our projects and certain of our insurance coverages. At September 30, 2024, we h ad million of outstanding surety bonds, of which million relates to our second forty-vehicle ferry project for our Shipyard Division (which will terminate in the first quarter 2025 upon expiration of the warranty period for the vessel) and million relates to our Fabrication Division contracts and certain of our insurance coverages. See Note 2 for further discussion of the warranty period for our second forty-vehicle ferry project and Note 4 for further discussion of our surety bonds and related indemnificatio n obligations. Note Agreement In connection with the resolution of our MPSV Litigation and the Settlement Agreement, on November 6, 2023, we entered into a promissory note Note Agreement with one of our Sureties (Fidelity Deposit Company of Maryland and Zurich American Insurance Company (collectively, Zurich )), pursuant to which we will pay Zurich million. The Note Agreement bears interest at a fixed rate of per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with equal annual installments of approximately million, beginning on and ending on .

Total maturities (1), (2) 

(1) At September 30, 2024, the estimated present value of the Note Agreement amount was million based on an estimated market rate of interest. 

 (2) Due to the forbearance of interest until January 1, 2024, the effective rate on the Note Agreement is per annum. 

See Note 4 for further discussion of the resolution of our MPSV Litigation and the Settlement Agreement. Mortgage Agreement We have a multiple indebtedness mortgage arrangement Mortgage Agreement with Zurich to secure our obligations and liabilities under the Note Agreement and our general indemnity agreement with Zurich associated with an outstanding surety bond for our forty-vehicle ferry projects. The Mortgage Agreement, as amended, encumbers all real estate associated with the Houma Facilities, includes certain covenants and events of default, and requires that percent of the net proceeds (as defined by the Mortgage Agreement) received by us in excess of million from the sale of any real estate of our Houma Facilities be used to make early payments on the principal balance under the Note Agreement . The Mortgage Agreement will terminate when the obligations and liabilities of Zurich associated with the outstanding surety bond for the forty-vehicle ferry projects are discharged and the Note Agreement is repaid. See Note Agreement above for further discussion of the Note Agreement and Note 2 for further discussion of our forty-vehicle ferry projects.

million, , with interest at a fixed rate of per annum. The general liability arrangement totaled million, , with interest at a fixed rate of per annum. We considered the transactions to be non-cash financing activities, with the initial financed amount reflected within accrued expenses and other liabilities, and a corresponding asset reflected within prepaid expenses and other assets, on our Balance Sheet. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we made principal payments of million , which have been reflected as a financing activity on our Statement of Cash Flows. 

 MPSVs. GIS disputed the purported terminations and disagreed with Hornbeck s reasons for such terminations. In connection with such purported terminations, Hornbeck also made claims against the performance bonds issued by Zurich in connection with the construction of the MPSVs, for which the face amount of the bonds totaled million Performance Bonds ). On October 2, 2018, GIS filed a lawsuit against Hornbeck to enforce its rights and remedies under the applicable construction contracts for the two MPSVs. The lawsuit was filed in the Twenty-Second Judicial District Court for the Parish of St. Tammany, State of Louisiana and was styled Gulf Island Shipyards, LLC v. Hornbeck Offshore Services, LLC, bearing docket number 2018-14861 MPSV Litigation ). Hornbeck subsequently asserted counterclaims against GIS and Zurich seeking damages. On October 4, 2023, the MPSV Litigation was dismissed in full with prejudice at the request of the parties after the parties reached an agreement in principle. In addition, on November 6, 2023, GIS and the Company entered into an agreement Settlement Agreement with Zurich pursuant to which Zurich released GIS and the Company from all of their obligations under the Performance Bonds and the associated general indemnity agreements relating to the Performance Bonds, and we agreed to release possession of the MPSVs to Zurich, which occurred in the fourth quarter 2023. Further, we entered into the Note Agreement. See Note 3 for further discussion of the Note Agreement. As a result of the resolution of the MPSV Litigation, during the third quarter 2023, we recorded a charge of million, consisting of (i) a million non-cash charge associated with the write-off of a noncurrent net contract asset related to the MPSV construction contracts, and (ii) a million charge associated with recording a liability resulting from the Settlement Agreement and Note Agreement. The charge was reflected as a reduction to previously recognized revenue on the MPSV construction contracts, resulting in a negative revenue amount for the Shipyard Division for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, and is included in the changes in noncurrent assets and liabilities, net on our Statement of Cash Flows. The liability was replaced with the Note Agreement in the fourth quarter 2023 and is reflected as current and long-term debt on our Balance Sheet at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Insurance We maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations. However, we may be exposed to future losses due to coverage limitations and our use of deductibles and self-insured retentions for our exposures related to property and equipment damage, builder s risk, third-party liability and workers compensation and USL H claims. During the second quarter 2024 and 2023, we reviewed our insurance coverage options for our property and equipment and determined that the benefits of such coverage were limited due to high premium costs and deductibles and increased coverage limitations. Accordingly, we are generally self-insured for exposures resulting from any future damage to our property and equipment.

Overview 
 We are a leading fabricator of complex steel structures and modules and provider of specialty services, including project management, hookup, commissioning, repair, maintenance, scaffolding, coatings, welding enclosures, civil construction and cleaning and environmental services to the industrial and energy sectors. Our customers include U.S. and, to a lesser extent, international energy producers; refining, petrochemical, LNG, industrial and power operators; and EPC companies. We currently operate and manage our business through three operating divisions Services , Fabrication and Shipyard and one non-operating division Corporate ), which represent our reportable segments. Our corporate headquarters is located in The Woodlands, Texas and our primary operating facilities are located in Houma, Louisiana Houma Facilities ). See Note 6 for further discussion of our reportable segments. 
 During 2021, we sold our Shipyard Division operating assets and certain construction contracts Shipyard Transaction ). The Shipyard Transaction excluded the contracts and related obligations for our seventy-vehicle ferry and two forty-vehicle ferry projects (collectively, Ferry Projects that were under construction as of the transaction date, and excluded the contracts and related obligations for the projects that were subject to our previous MPSV Litigation, which was resolved on October 4, 2023. The wind down of our remaining Shipyard Division operations was substantially completed in the fourth quarter 2023. Final completion of the wind down will occur upon completion of the warranty periods for the Ferry Projects, the last of which ends in the first quarter 2025. See Note 2 for further discussion of our Ferry Projects, Note 4 for further discussion of the resolution of our MPSV Litigation and Note 6 for further discussion of the wind down of our Shipyard Division operations. 
 Impacts of Oil and Gas Price Volatility and Macroeconomic Conditions on Operations 
 For over a decade, prices of oil and gas have experienced significant volatility, including depressed prices over extended periods, which negatively impacted our end markets and operating results. The global coronavirus pandemic COVID-19 added another layer of pressure and uncertainty on oil and gas prices (with oil prices reaching a twenty-year low and gas prices reaching a four-year low in 2020), which further negatively impacted certain of our end markets through the first quarter 2022. This volatility in oil and gas prices was compounded by Russia s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 (and the related European energy crisis), and the U.S. and other countries actions in response, as well as continued inflationary pressures, resulting in elevated energy prices (with oil prices reaching an eight-year high and gas prices reaching a fourteen-year high in 2022), which positively impacted certain of our end markets. While oil prices have somewhat stabilized, the duration of such stability is uncertain and difficult to predict, particularly in light of geopolitical turmoil and uncertainty. 
 In addition, global economic factors that are beyond our control, have and could continue to impact our operations, including, but are not limited to, labor constraints, supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, economic slowdowns and recessions, natural disasters, public health crises and geopolitical conflicts. 
 The ultimate business and financial impacts of oil and gas price volatility and macroeconomic conditions on our business and results of operations continues to be uncertain, but the impacts have included, or may continue to include, among other things, reduced bidding activity; suspension or termination of backlog; deterioration of customer financial condition; and unanticipated project costs and schedule delays due to supply chain disruptions, labor and material price increases, lower labor productivity, increased employee and contractor absenteeism and turnover, craft labor hiring challenges, increased safety incidents, lack of performance by subcontractors and suppliers, and contract disputes. We continue to monitor the impacts of oil and gas price volatility and macroeconomic conditions on our operations, and our estimates in future periods will be revised for any events and changes in circumstances arising after the date of this Report. See Note 1 for further discussion of the impacts of oil and gas price volatility and macroeconomic conditions and Note 2 for further discussion of the impacts of the aforementioned on our projects.

Other Impacts to Operations 
 Hurricanes Francine and Helene In mid-September 2024, Hurricane Francine made landfall near our Houma Facilities as a Category 2 hurricane, and in late-September 2024, Hurricane Helene made landfall along the coast of Florida as a Category 4 hurricane. While we did not experience any significant damage to our Houma Facilities or equipment as a result of Hurricane Francine, our Fabrication Division operations were temporarily suspended due to pre-storm preparation activities and post-storm power outages. Further, our Services Division operations were impacted due to the temporary removal of our personnel from customer offshore platforms while both storms approached and passed through the Gulf of Mexico GOM ). As a result of the aforementioned, our operating results for the third quarter 2024 were negatively impacted due to reduced utilization of our facilities and resources. 
 Houma AHFS During the first quarter 2024, we sold certain excess real property (consisting of land and buildings) that was part of our Houma Facilities, resulting in a gain for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 for our Fabrication Division. The property sold was classified as an asset held for sale Houma AHFS on our Balance Sheet at December 31, 2023. See Note 1 for further discussion of the sale of our Houma AHFS. 
 MPSV Litigation During the fourth quarter 2023, we resolved our MPSV Litigation and entered into the Settlement Agreement and Note Agreement, resulting in a charge during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 for our Shipyard Division. See Note 3 for further discussion of the Note Agreement and Note 4 for further discussion of the resolution of our MPSV Litigation and the Settlement Agreement. 
 Ferry Projects During 2023 and 2022, we experienced construction challenges and cost increases on our Ferry Projects for our Shipyard Division. See Note 2 for further discussion of our Ferry Projects. 
 Offshore Jackets Project During 2022, we were awarded a large contract for the fabrication of offshore jackets for our Fabrication Division. In February 2023, we received direction from our customer to suspend all activities on the project, and in July 2023, the customer canceled the contract. 
 Hurricane Ida During 2021, our operations were impacted by Hurricane Ida. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we received insurance payments associated with our insurance coverages, and during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded gains for our Fabrication Division related to the net impact of insurance recoveries and costs associated with such damage. See Note 2 for further discussion of the impacts of Hurricane Ida. 
 Initiatives to Improve Operating Results and Generate Stable, Profitable Growth 
 During 2020, we outlined a strategy to address our operational, market and economic challenges and position the Company to generate stable, profitable growth. Underpinning the first phase of our strategic transformation was a focus on the following initiatives: 
 Mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on our operations and workforce; 

Reduce our risk profile; 

Preserve and improve our liquidity; 

Improve our resource utilization and centralize key project resources; 

Improve our competitiveness and project execution; and 

Reduce our reliance on the offshore oil and gas construction sector and pursue new growth end markets. 

- 22 - 

With the significant progress achieved on these objectives, during 2021, we shifted our focus to the current phase of our strategic transformation, which is focused on generating stable, profitable growth. Underpinning this strategy is a focus on the following initiatives, which encompass any ongoing initiatives associated with the first phase of our strategic transformation: 
 Expand our skilled workforce; 

Further improve our resource utilization; 

Further strengthen project execution and maintain bidding discipline; 

Diversify our offshore services customer base, increase our offshore services offerings and expand our services business to include onshore facilities along the Gulf Coast; 

Continue to pursue opportunities in our traditional offshore fabrication markets; and 

Reduce our reliance on the offshore oil and gas construction sector, pursue additional growth end markets and increase our T M versus fixed price revenue mix, including: 

Fabricating modules, piping systems and other structures for onshore refining, petrochemical, LNG and industrial facilities in our core Gulf Coast region, 

Fabricating structures in support of our customers as they transition away from fossil fuels to green energy end markets, 

Fabricating structures that support public and private construction activities outside of energy end markets, and 

Fabricating foundations, secondary steel components and support structures for offshore wind developments. 

Progress on the Current Phase of our Strategic Transformation 
 Efforts to expand our skilled workforce We are focused on ways to improve retention and enhance and add to our skilled, craft personnel, as we believe a strong workforce will be a key differentiator in pursuing new project awards given the scarcity of available skilled labor. Our acquisition of a services and industrial staffing business during 2021 nearly doubled our skilled workforce and expanded our geographic footprint. We have successfully maintained our overall headcount levels and have opportunistically looked to shift our workforce to higher margin opportunities given the industry-wide labor constraints. We continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our skilled labor headcount given the favorable demand trends, including strategic acquisitions to increase our craft labor headcount. 
 Efforts to further improve our resource utilization We continue to take actions to improve our resource utilization through the rationalization and integration of our facilities and operations. 
 Completion of the wind down of our Shipyard Division operations During 2021, we completed the Shipyard Transaction and the wind down of our remaining Shipyard Division operations was substantially completed in the fourth quarter 2023. The wind down of our Shipyard Division operations is expected to reduce overhead costs, improve utilization and enable senior management to focus on existing and new higher-margin markets associated with our other operating divisions. See Note 1 for further discussion of the Shipyard Transaction and Note 6 for further discussion of the status of the wind down of our Shipyard Division operations. 

Consolidation of our fabrication activities During 2022, we realigned our operating divisions, which included combining all of our fabrication activities within our Fabrication Division to improve utilization and operational efficiency. 

Sale of assets During 2022, we sold a purchase option that was entered into in connection with a previous acquisition that provided us with a right to buy a leased fabrication and operating facility for a nominal amount. Further, the fabrication activities previously performed at the facility were moved to our Houma Facilities to improve utilization and operational efficiency. In addition, we entered into a separate lease arrangement for a smaller and more cost-effective office and warehouse facility to accommodate our services activities performed at the previous facility. 

Sublease of our corporate office During 2022, we entered into a sublease arrangement with a third-party for the remainder of our corporate office, which will partially recover our lease costs for the office for the duration of our lease. In addition, we entered into a separate lease arrangement for a smaller and more cost-effective office to accommodate our corporate activities. 

Sale of excess property During 2023, we commenced an effort to further consolidate our fabrication operations within our Houma Facilities to reduce overhead costs, improve utilization and make our Houma AHFS available for sale. As a result of these efforts, during the first quarter 2024, we sold our Houma AHFS. See Other Impacts to Operations above and Note 1 for further discussion of the sale of our Houma AHFS.

Efforts to further strengthen project execution and maintain bidding discipline We have taken, and continue to take, actions to improve our project execution by enhancing our proposal, estimating and operations resources, processes and procedures. Our actions include strategic changes in management and key personnel, the addition of functional expertise, project management training, development of a formal lessons learned program, and other measures designed to strengthen our personnel, processes and procedures. Further, we are taking a disciplined approach to pursuing and bidding project opportunities, putting more rigor around our bid estimates to provide greater confidence that our estimates are achievable, increasing accountability and providing incentives for the execution of projects in line with our original estimates and subsequent forecasts, and incorporating previous experience into the bidding and execution of future projects. Additionally, we are focused on managing the risks associated with long-term fixed price contracts given the unpredictability of labor availability and labor and material costs, with a priority on increasing the mix of T M contracts in our backlog. 
 Efforts to diversify our offshore services customer base, increase our offshore services offerings and expand our services business to include onshore facilities along the Gulf Coast We believe diversifying and expanding our services business will deliver a more stable revenue stream while providing underpinning work to recruit, develop and retain our craft professionals. Our acquisition of a services and industrial staffing business during 2021 accelerated our progress in this initiative and provided a stronger platform to continue such progress. Further, during 2022, we expanded our offshore services offering to include welding enclosures, which provide a safe environment for welding, cutting and burning without the need to shut down operations. Additionally, during the second quarter 2024, we expanded our offshore services offering to include cleaning and environmental services, which provides decontamination, flushing and removal of hydrocarbon residue from process equipment and piping on offshore facilities prior to the performance of maintenance, repair or decommissioning. We are also pursuing opportunities to partner with original equipment manufacturers to provide critical services to our customers along the Gulf Coast and strategic partnership opportunities with engineering companies to provide turnkey solutions. 
 Efforts to continue to pursue opportunities in our traditional offshore fabrication markets We continue to fabricate structures associated with our traditional offshore markets, including subsea and associated structures. During 2022, we were awarded a large contract for the fabrication of offshore jackets; however, the project was suspended in February 2023 and canceled in July 2023. Since early 2023, we have been awarded multiple contracts for the fabrication of subsea structures, resulting from our previous strategic decision to focus our resources on the subsea fabrication market. We expect subsea fabrication activity to remain strong for the remainder of 2024 and well into 2025, associated with anticipated subsea developments in the GOM, Guyana and Brazil. 
 - 24 - 

Efforts to reduce our reliance on the offshore oil and gas construction sector, pursue new growth end markets and increase our T M versus fixed price revenue mix While we continue to pursue opportunities in our traditional offshore markets, we are pursuing initiatives to grow our business and diversify our revenue mix. 
 Fabricate onshore modules, piping systems and structures We continue to focus our business development efforts on the fabrication of modules, piping systems and other structures for onshore refining, petrochemical, LNG and industrial facilities. We are having success with smaller project opportunities and our volume of bidding activity for onshore modules, piping systems and structures continues to be strong. We continue to believe that our strategic location in Houma, Louisiana and track record of quality and on-time completion of onshore modules position us well to compete in the onshore fabrication market. We intend to remain disciplined in our pursuit of future large project opportunities to ensure we do not take unnecessary risks generally associated with the long-term, fixed-price nature of such projects. The timing of any future large project opportunities may be impacted by ongoing uncertainty created by oil and gas price volatility and macroeconomic conditions. We continue to strengthen our relationships with key customers and strategic partners and enhance and rationalize our resources as discussed above. See Note 1 for further discussion of the impacts of oil and gas price volatility and macroeconomic conditions. 

Fabricate structures in support of our customers as they transition away from fossil fuels to green energy end markets We believe that our expertise and capabilities provide us with the necessary foundation to fabricate steel structures in support of our customers as they transition away from fossil fuels to green energy end markets. Examples of these opportunities include refiners who are looking to process biofuels, customers looking to embrace the growing hydrogen economy, and customers using carbon capture technologies to offset their carbon footprint. 

Fabricate structures that support public and private construction activities outside of energy end markets We believe our expertise and capabilities for the fabrication of steel structures will enable us to successfully serve a wide range of construction markets. Examples of these opportunities include private construction for the fabrication of structures for data centers and semiconductor manufacturing sites, public construction related to the fabrication of structures to support infrastructure spending, and federal government contracts, such as our contract to support the NASA Artemis Mobile Launcher 2 project. 

Fabricate offshore wind foundations, secondary steel components and support structures We continue to believe that current initiatives, and potential future requirements, to provide electricity from renewable and green sources will result in growth of offshore wind projects. We believe that we possess the expertise to fabricate foundations, secondary steel components and support structures for this emerging market. This is demonstrated by our fabrication of wind turbine foundations for the first offshore wind project in the U.S. and the fabrication of a meteorological tower and platform for a separate offshore wind project. While we believe we have the capability to participate in this emerging market, we do not expect meaningful opportunities in the near-term. 

Operating Outlook 
 Our focus remains on securing profitable new project awards and backlog and generating operating income and cash flows, while ensuring the safety and well-being of our workforce. Our success, including achieving the aforementioned initiatives, will be determined by, among other things: 
 Our ability to hire, develop, motivate and retain key personnel and craft labor to execute our projects in light of industry-wide labor constraints, and maintain our expected project margins if such constraints result in labor cost increases that cannot be recovered from our customers; 

Oil and gas prices and the level of volatility in such prices, including the impact of macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical conflicts and any current or future public health crises; 

The level of fabrication opportunities in our traditional offshore markets and the new markets that we are pursuing, including refining, petrochemical, LNG and industrial facilities, green energy and offshore wind developments, and the impact of any climate-related regulations; 

The timing of recognition of our backlog as revenue; 

Our ability to secure new project awards through competitive bidding and/or alliance and partnering arrangements; 

Our ability to execute projects within our cost estimates and successfully manage them through completion; 

The final completion of the wind down of our Shipyard Division operations, which is subject to the expiration of the warranty periods for our Ferry Projects; 

Consideration of organic and inorganic opportunities for growth, including, but not limited to, mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, partnerships and other strategic arrangements, transactions and capital allocations; and 

The operability and adequacy of our major equipment. 

- 25 - 

In addition, the near-term utilization of our Fabrication Division will be impacted by the timing of new project awards and their execution, including the replacement of our canceled offshore jackets project, and our operations may continue to be impacted by inefficiencies and disruptions associated with employee turnover, craft labor hiring challenges, engineering delays, and supplier and subcontractor disruptions. Our results may also be adversely affected by (i) costs associated with the retention of certain personnel that may be temporarily under-utilized as we evaluate our resource requirements to support our future operations, (ii) investments in strategic opportunities, (iii) investments in key personnel and process improvement efforts to support our aforementioned initiatives, and (iv) higher costs and availability of craft labor due to industry labor constraints. See Note 1 and Impacts of Oil and Gas Price Volatility and Macroeconomic Conditions on Operations above for further discussion of the impacts of oil and gas price volatility and macroeconomic conditions, Other Impacts to Operations above for further discussion of the project cancellation and Note 2 and Results of Operations below for further discussion of our project impacts. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 For a discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our Financial Statements, refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 included in our 2023 Annual Report. There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since December 31, 2023. 
 New Project Awards and Backlog 
 New project awards represent expected revenue values of new contract commitments received during a given period, including scope growth on existing commitments. A commitment represents authorization from our customer to begin work or purchase materials pursuant to a written agreement, letter of intent or other form of authorization. Backlog represents the unrecognized revenue value of our new project awards and at September 30, 2024, was consistent with the value of remaining performance obligations for our contracts required to be disclosed under Topic 606 and presented in Note 2. In general, a performance obligation is a contractual obligation to construct and/or transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. We believe that backlog, a non-GAAP financial measure, provides useful information to investors as it represents work that we are obligated to perform under our current contracts. New project awards and backlog may vary significantly each reporting period based on the timing of our major new contract commitments. 
 Projects in our backlog are generally subject to delay, suspension, termination, or an increase or decrease in scope at the option of the customer; however, the customer is required to pay us for work performed and materials purchased through the date of termination, suspension, or decrease in scope. Depending on the size of the project, the delay, suspension, termination or increase or decrease in scope of any one contract could significantly impact our backlog and change the expected amount and timing of revenue recognized.

References below to 2024 and 2023 refer to the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 New project awards New project awards for 2024 and 2023 were 36.9 million and 38.4 million, respectively. New project awards for 2024 and 2023 were primarily related to: 
 Small-scale fabrication work for our Fabrication Division, and 

Offshore services work for our Services Division. 

Revenue Revenue for 2024 and 2023 was 37.6 million and 5.0 million, respectively. The increase was primarily due to: 
 Higher revenue for our Shipyard Division, an increase of 33.2 million, primarily attributable to negative revenue for the 2023 period due to the reversal of 32.5 million of previously recognized revenue, resulting from the resolution of our MPSV Litigation, and 

Higher revenue for our Fabrication Division, an increase of 2.1 million, primarily attributable to higher small-scale fabrication activity, offset partially by, 

Lower revenue for our Services Division, a decrease of 2.7 million, primarily attributable to: 

Lower offshore services work driven by delayed timing of certain project opportunities, and 

Lower activity due to delays caused by hurricanes Francine and Helene in September 2024. 

See Other Impacts to Operations above for further discussion of the impacts of hurricanes Francine and Helene. See Note 4 for further discussion of the resolution of our MPSV Litigation. 
 Gross profit (loss) Gross profit for 2024 was 4.7 million (12.4 of revenue) and gross loss for 2023 was 29.9 million. The gross profit for 2024 relative to gross loss for 2023 was primarily due to: 
 Gross profit for 2024 compared to a gross loss for 2023 for our Shipyard Division, and 

Higher revenue and improved utilization of our facilities and resources for our Fabrication Division, offset partially by, 

Lower revenue for our Services Division, 

A lower margin project mix for our Services Division, and 

Project improvements of 0.7 million for the 2023 period for our Fabrication Division. 

See Operating Segments below and Note 2 for discussion of our project impacts. 
 - 27 - 

General and administrative expense General and administrative expense for 2024 and 2023 was 3.0 million and 4.1 million, respectively, representing a decrease of 26.8 . The decrease was primarily due to: 
 The elimination of legal and advisory fees associated with our previous MPSV Litigation, which totaled 0.9 million for 2023, for our Shipyard Division, 

Lower incentive plan costs for our Corporate Division, and 

The timing of certain costs for all our divisions. 

See Note 4 for further discussion of the resolution of our MPSV Litigation. 
 Other (income) expense, net Other (income) expense, net for 2023 was income of 0.3 million. Other (income) expense, net generally represents recoveries or provisions for bad debts and credit losses, gains or losses associated with the sale or disposition of property and equipment, and income or expense associated with certain nonrecurring items. Other income for 2023 was primarily due to: 
 Gains of 0.3 million related to the net impact of insurance recoveries and costs associated with damage previously caused by Hurricane Ida to buildings and equipment at our Houma Facilities for our Fabrication Division, and 

Gains on the sales of equipment and scrap materials for our Fabrication Division, offset partially by, 

Costs of 0.4 million associated with the consolidation of fabrication activities at our Houma Facilities for our Fabrication Division. 

See Note 2 for further discussion of the impacts of Hurricane Ida. 
 Interest (expense) income, net Interest (expense) income, net for 2024 and 2023 was income of 0.6 million and 0.4 million, respectively. Interest (expense) income, net for both periods includes the net impact of interest earned on our cash and short-term investment balances and interest incurred on the unused portion of our LC Facility. The 2024 period also includes interest incurred on our long-term debt and the 2023 period includes interest incurred on our Insurance Finance Arrangements. The increase in income for 2024 relative to 2023 was primarily due to higher interest earned on our cash and short-term investment balances and the elimination of interest on our Insurance Finance Arrangements for the 2024 period, offset partially by interest incurred on our long-term debt for the 2024 period. 
 Income tax (expense) benefit Income tax (expense) benefit for 2024 and 2023 represents state income taxes. No federal income tax expense was recorded for our income for 2024 as it was fully offset by the reversal of valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets, and no federal income tax benefit was recorded for our loss for 2023 as a full valuation allowance was recorded against our net deferred tax assets generated during the period.

No revenue for our offshore jackets project that was canceled in July 2023, offset partially by, 

Higher small-scale fabrication activity, and 

Lower revenue for our Services Division, a decrease of 0.5 million, primarily attributable to lower offshore services work. 

See Note 4 for further discussion of the resolution of our MPSV Litigation. 
 Gross profit (loss) Gross profit for 2024 was 14.9 million (12.3 of revenue) and gross loss for 2023 was 20.4 million. The gross profit for 2024 relative to gross loss for 2023 was primarily due to: 
 Gross profit for 2024 compared to a gross loss for 2023 for our Shipyard Division, 

A higher margin project mix for our Fabrication Division, and 

Lower property and equipment insurance costs for our Fabrication Division, offset partially by, 

Lower revenue for our Fabrication Division and Services Division, 

Project improvements of 0.7 million for the 2023 period for our Fabrication Division, and 

A lower margin project mix for our Services Division. 

See Operating Segments below and Note 2 for discussion of our project impacts and Note 4 for further discussion of our property and equipment insurance coverages. 
 - 33 - 

General and administrative expense General and administrative expense for 2024 and 2023 was 9.8 million and 12.9 million, respectively, representing a decrease of 23.8 . The decrease was primarily due to: 
 The elimination of legal and advisory fees associated with our previous MPSV Litigation, which totaled 3.1 million for 2023, for our Shipyard Division, offset partially by, 

Higher costs associated with initiatives to diversify and enhance our business for our Corporate Division, and 

The timing of certain costs for all our divisions. 

See Note 4 for further discussion of the resolution of our MPSV Litigation. 
 Other (income) expense, net Other (income) expense, net for 2024 and 2023 was income of 3.5 million and 0.7 million, respectively. Other (income) expense, net generally represents recoveries or provisions for bad debts and credit losses, gains or losses associated with the sale or disposition of property and equipment, and income or expense associated with certain nonrecurring items. Other income for 2024 was primarily due to: 
 A gain of 2.9 million on the sale of our Houma AHFS for our Fabrication Division, 

Gains of 1.1 million on the sales of excess equipment for our Fabrication Division, and 

Gains on the sales of scrap materials and other miscellaneous income items for our Fabrication Division, offset partially by, 

Costs of 0.9 million associated with the consolidation of fabrication activities at our Houma Facilities for our Fabrication Division. 

Other income for 2023 was primarily due to: 
 Gains of 0.5 million related to the net impact of insurance recoveries and costs associated with damage previously caused by Hurricane Ida to buildings and equipment at our Houma Facilities for our Fabrication Division, and 

Gains on the sales of equipment and scrap material for our Fabrication Division, offset partially by, 

Costs of 0.4 million associated with the consolidation of fabrication activities at our Houma Facilities for our Fabrication Division, and 

Charges of 0.4 million associated with damage previously caused by Hurricane Ida to bulkheads and the MPSVs that were previously in our possession and subject to our previous MPSV Litigation for our Shipyard Division. 

See Note 1 for further discussion of the sale of our Houma AHFS, Note 2 for further discussion of the impacts of Hurricane Ida and Note 4 for further discussion of the resolution of our MPSV Litigation. 
 Interest (expense) income, net Interest (expense) income, net for 2024 and 2023 was income of 1.8 million and 1.1 million, respectively. Interest (expense) income, net for both periods includes the net impact of interest earned on our cash and short-term investment balances and interest incurred on the unused portion of our LC Facility. The 2024 period also includes interest incurred on our long-term debt and the 2023 period includes interest incurred on our Insurance Finance Arrangements. The increase in income for 2024 relative to 2023 was primarily due to higher interest earned on our cash and short-term investment balances and the elimination of interest on our Insurance Finance Arrangements for the 2024 period, offset partially by interest incurred on our long-term debt for the 2024 period. 
 Income tax (expense) benefit Income tax (expense) benefit for 2024 and 2023 represents state income taxes. No federal income tax expense was recorded for our income for 2024 as it was fully offset by the reversal of valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets, and no federal income tax benefit was recorded for our loss for 2023 as a full valuation allowance was recorded against our net deferred tax assets generated during the period.

Gross profit Gross profit for 2024 and 2023 was 6.0 million (11.3 of revenue) and 5.2 million (7.6 of revenue), respectively. The increase in gross profit for 2024 relative to 2023 was primarily due to: 
 A higher margin project mix associated with our small-scale fabrication work, and 

Lower property and equipment insurance costs, offset partially by, 

The net impact of lower utilization of our facilities and resources resulting from the cancellation of our offshore jackets project in July 2023 and improved utilization of our facilities and resources associated with higher small-scale fabrication activity, 

Lower revenue, and 

Project improvements of 0.7 million for the 2023 period related to favorable resolution of customer change orders.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Available Liquidity 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents and scheduled maturities of our short-term investments. At September 30, 2024, our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash totaled 66.8 million, as follows (in thousands):

Total cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash 

66,825 

(1) Includes U.S. Treasuries with original maturities of approximately four to six months. 

Our available liquidity is impacted by changes in our working capital and our capital expenditure requirements. Fluctuations in our working capital, and its components, are not unusual in our business and are impacted by the size of our projects and the mix of our backlog. Our working capital is particularly impacted by the timing of new project awards and related payments in advance of performing work, and the subsequent achievement of billing milestones or project progress on backlog. Working capital is also impacted at period-end by the timing of contract receivables collections and accounts payable payments on our projects. 
 At September 30, 2024, our working capital was 80.2 million and included 66.8 million of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and 1.1 million of current debt. Excluding cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and current debt, our working capital at September 30, 2024 was 14.5 million, and consisted of: net contract assets and contract liabilities of 4.3 million; contract receivables and retainage of 23.5 million; inventory, prepaid expenses and other current assets of 6.3 million; and accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities of 19.7 million. The components of our working capital (excluding cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and current debt) at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and changes in such amounts during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were as follows (in thousands):

Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 15.9 million and cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 0.2 million, and was primarily due to the net impacts of the following: 
 2024 Activity 
 Net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization of 3.6 million, a gain on the sale of our Houma AHFS and fixed assets of 3.9 million and stock-based compensation expense of 1.4 million; 

Decrease in contract receivables and retainage of 12.8 million related to the timing of billings and collections on projects, primarily due to lower receivable positions on various projects for our Services Division and Fabrication Division; 

Increase in contract assets of 3.1 million related to the timing of billings on projects, primarily due to higher unbilled positions on various projects for our Fabrication Division; 

Decrease in contract liabilities of 4.0 million, primarily due to lower advance billings on various projects for our Fabrication Division; 

Decrease in prepaid expenses, inventory and other assets of 2.4 million, primarily due to prepaid expenses and the associated timing of certain prepayments and the collection of insurance receivables associated with Hurricane Ida. See Note 2 for further discussion of the Hurricane Ida insurance receivables; 

Decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities of 3.3 million related to the timing of payments, primarily due to lower accounts payable positions on various projects for our Services Division and Fabrication Division; and 

Change in noncurrent assets and liabilities, net of 0.4 million. 

2023 Activity 
 Net loss adjusted for depreciation and amortization of 4.1 million, a gain from net changes in allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses of 0.4 million, a gain on insurance recoveries of 0.2 million, a gain on the sale of fixed assets of 0.2 million and stock-based compensation expense of 1.5 million; 

Increase in contract receivables and retainage of 6.5 million related to the timing of billings and collections on projects, primarily due to higher receivable positions on various projects for our Fabrication Division and Services Division; 

Decrease in contract assets of 0.5 million related to the timing of billings on projects, primarily due to lower unbilled positions on our forty-vehicle ferry projects for our Shipyard Division, offset partially by higher unbilled positions on various projects for our Fabrication Division; 

Decrease in contract liabilities of 4.7 million, primarily due to lower advance billings on our cancelled offshore jackets project for our Fabrication Division and accrued contract losses on our forty-vehicle ferry projects for our Shipyard Division; 

Decrease in prepaid expenses, inventory and other assets of 2.8 million, primarily due to prepaid expenses and the associated timing of certain prepayments; 

Increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities of 2.5 million related to the timing of payments, primarily due to higher accounts payable positions on various projects for our Fabrication Division; and 

Change in noncurrent assets and liabilities, net of 31.9 million, primarily due to the write-off of a 12.5 million noncurrent net contract asset, and recording of a 20.0 million liability, associated with the resolution of our MPSV Litigation. The liability was replaced with the Note Agreement in the fourth quarter 2023. See Note 3 for further discussion of the Note Agreement and Note 4 for further discussion of the resolution of our MPSV Litigation. 

Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 30.7 million and 6.6 million, respectively. Cash used in investing activities for 2024 was primarily due to net purchases of short-term investments of 35.8 million and capital expenditures of 4.9 million, offset partially by proceeds from the sale of our Houma AHFS and fixed assets of 9.6 million and recoveries from insurance claims of 0.3 million. Cash used in investing activities for 2023 was primarily due to net purchases of short-term investments of 5.5 million and capital expenditures of 1.7 million, offset partially by proceeds from the sale of fixed assets of 0.4 million and recoveries from insurance claims of 0.2 million. See Note 1 for further discussion of the sale of our Houma AHFS and Note 2 for further discussion of our insurance claims associated with Hurricane Ida. 
 Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 2.1 million and 1.7 million, respectively. Cash used in financing activities for 2024 was primarily due to the repurchase of 0.9 million of our common stock under our Share Repurchase Program and tax payments of 1.2 million made on behalf of employees from vested stock withholdings. Cash used in financing activities for 2023 was primarily due to payments on our Insurance Finance Arrangements of 1.3 million and tax payments of 0.5 million made on behalf of employees from vested stock withholdings. See Note 3 for further discussion of our Insurance Finance Arrangements and Note 5 for further discussion of our Share Repurchase Program.

Credit Facilities 
 See Note 3 for discussion of our LC Facility, Surety Bonds, Note Agreement, Mortgage Agreement and Insurance Finance Arrangements. 
 Registration Statement 
 We have a shelf registration statement that is effective with the SEC that expires on August 24, 2026. The shelf registration statement enables us to issue up to 200.0 million in either debt or equity securities, or a combination thereof, from time to time subsequent to the filing of a prospectus supplement, which among other things, identifies the underwriter, dealer or agent, specifies the number and value of securities that may be sold, and provides a time frame over which the securities may be offered. 
 Liquidity Outlook 
 We have made significant progress in our efforts to preserve and improve our liquidity, including cost reductions, the sale of under-utilized assets and facilities, improved project cash flow management and the completion of the Shipyard Transaction. The primary uses of our liquidity for the remainder of 2024 and the foreseeable future are to fund: 
 Costs associated with the under-utilization of our facilities and resources for our Fabrication Division until we secure and begin to execute sufficient backlog to achieve full utilization levels; 

Capital expenditures, including expenditures to maintain, upgrade and replace aged equipment; 

Working capital requirements for our projects, including the unwind of advance payments on projects; 

Interest and principal payments on our Note Agreement. See Note 3 for further discussion of our Note Agreement; 

Corporate administrative expenses (including the temporary under-utilization of personnel as we evaluate our resource requirements to support our future operations); 

Organic and inorganic opportunities for growth, including mergers and acquisitions; 

Remaining liabilities of our Shipyard Division operations (including accrued contract losses for our Ferry Projects); and 

Our Share Repurchase Program. See Note 5 for further discussion of our Share Repurchase Program. 

We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately 0.5 to 1.0 million for the remainder of 2024. Approximately 4.5 million of our total estimated capital expenditures for 2024 relate to upgrades to our Houma Facilities and investments in more technologically advanced equipment. In the first quarter 2024, we received insurance proceeds of 2.0 million associated with damage previously caused to our Houma Facilities by Hurricane Ida, which has partially supplemented our capital expenditures for 2024. Further investments in our facilities and equipment may be required to win and execute potential new project awards, which are not included in these estimates. See Note 2 for further discussion of the insurance proceeds received associated with damage previously caused by Hurricane Ida. 
 We believe that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at September 30, 2024, will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses, meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, and satisfy any debt service obligations or other funding requirements, for the remainder of 2024 and the foreseeable future. Our evaluation of the sufficiency of our cash and liquidity is primarily based on our financial forecasts for 2024 and 2025, which are impacted by our existing backlog and estimates of future new project awards and may be further impacted by the ongoing effects of oil and gas price volatility and macroeconomic conditions, and future losses, if any, due to coverage limitations and our use of deductibles and self-insured retentions for our exposures related to property and equipment damage, builder s risk, third-party liability and workers compensation and USL H claims. We can provide no assurances that our financial forecasts will be achieved or that we will have sufficient cash and short-term investments to meet planned operating expenses and unforeseen cash requirements. Accordingly, we may be required to obtain new or additional credit facilities, sell additional assets or conduct equity or debt offerings at a time when it is not beneficial to do so. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We are not a party to any contract or other obligation not included on our Balance Sheet that has, or is reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Not applicable. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. 
 During the third quarter 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
