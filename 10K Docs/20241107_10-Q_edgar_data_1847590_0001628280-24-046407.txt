 offices throughout the United States and offices in Mexico. Bowman is a professional services firm delivering innovative solutions to the marketplace of customers who own, develop and maintain the built environment. Within that arena, we provide planning, design, engineering, geospatial, survey, construction management, environmental consulting and land procurement services to markets that encompass the buildings in which people live, work and learn in; as well as the systems that provide water, electricity and other vital services, and the roads, bridges, and transportation systems used to get from place to place. We provide services to customers through fixed-price and time-and-material based contracts containing multiple milestones and independently priced deliverables. Typically, contract awards are on a negotiated basis, ranging in value from a few thousand dollars to multiple millions of dollars and can have varying durations depending on the size, scope, and complexity of the project. 
 The Company s workforce typically provides the full scope of engineering and other contract services. However, with respect to certain specialty services or other compliance requirements within a particular contract, we may engage third-party sub-consultants. 
 Common Stock Offering 
 On April 1, 2024, the Company closed on an offering of common stock in which it issued and sold shares at an offering price of per share, resulting in net proceeds of million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, but before expenses of the offering. 
 On April 1, 2024, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional shares of the Company s common stock at an offering price of per share, resulting in additional gross proceeds of approximately million. After giving effect to this exercise of the overallotment option, the total number of shares sold by the Company in this common stock offering increased to shares with gross proceeds of approximately million. The exercise of the over-allotment option closed on April 1, 2024, at which time the Company received net proceeds of million after underwriting discounts and commissions. 
 Deferred offering costs consist primarily of accounting, legal and other fees related to the common stock offering. Prior to the offering, all deferred costs were capitalized within prepaid and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet. We capitalized million of deferred offering costs within prepaid and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023. deferred offering costs were capitalized in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024.

-day basis. Exceptions to monthly billing are to ensure that the Company performs satisfactorily and do not represent a significant financing component. For example, certain fixed price contracts provide for milestone billings based upon the attainment of specific project objectives to ensure the Company meets its contractual requirements rather than monthly billing. Another example is, contracts that include retentions or holdbacks paid at the end of a project to ensure that the Company meets the contract requirements. The Company does not assess whether a contract contains a significant financing component if the Company expects, at contract inception, that the period between payment by the customer and the transfer of promised services to the customer will be less than one year. 
 As a professional services engineering firm, the Company generally recognizes revenue over time as control transfers to a customer based upon the extent of progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligation. 
 For services delivered under fixed price contracts, the Company uses the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs since costs incurred (an input method) represents a reasonable measure of progress towards the satisfaction of a performance obligation in order to estimate the portion of revenue earned. This method faithfully depicts the transfer of value to the customer when the Company is satisfying a performance obligation that entails a number of interrelated tasks or activities for a combined output that requires the Company to coordinate the work of employees and sub-consultants. Contract costs typically include direct labor, subcontract and consultant costs, materials and indirect costs related to contract performance. Changes in estimated costs to complete these obligations result in adjustments to revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis, so that revised estimates are recognized in the current period. Changes in estimates can routinely occur over the contract term for a variety of reasons including, changes in scope, unanticipated costs, delays or favorable or unfavorable progress that differ from original expectations. In situations where the remaining estimated costs to perform exceed the consideration to be received, the Company accrues the entire estimated loss during the period the loss becomes known. 
 When a performance obligation is billed using a time-and-material type contract, the Company measures its progress to complete based upon the hours incurred for the period times contractually agreed upon billing rates plus any materials delivered or consumed in the project. When applicable, the Company will recognize revenue under these contracts as invoiced under the practical expedient.

 million related to its position regarding Section 174 costs. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company made a determination to change its accounting method for Section 174 costs, and accordingly, released an uncertain tax position reserve of million associated with the previously established position. While this method change is a timing difference between current and deferred taxes, the effect of this release generated an income tax benefit of million as a result of a decrease in accrued tax penalties and interest. In October 2024, the Company reevaluated its previous determination in this matter and concluded there was a reasonable basis to file the 2023 income tax return under its historical accounting method for Section 174 costs. Accordingly, the Company has re-established the aforementioned uncertain tax position, and determined that accrued penalties are no longer necessary based on the tax filing position and disclosure. As of the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company's uncertain tax position reserve for Section 174 costs was million. 
 The Company recognizes the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was and , respectively. The change in the Company s effective tax rate is predominantly due to changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate and certain non-recurring discrete events, as discussed below. The most prominent factors impacting the estimated annual effective tax rate include an increase in projected R D credits generated for 2024, an increase in the projected limitations of the deductible executive compensation for 2024, and an overall reduction in forecasted income for 2024 relative to 2023. With respect to the projected R D credit, the Company anticipates the 2024 generated R D credit to be million as of September 30, 2024, as compared to the projected R D credit to be generated of million as of September 30, 2023. Similarly, the Company anticipates the annual projected limitation on the deductibility of executive compensation to be million for 2024 as compared to million for 2023. 
 Further, the Company also recognized a net discrete benefit of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a net discrete benefit of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net discrete benefit is predominantly the result of a windfall tax benefit for restricted stock awards, penalties and interest recorded for uncertain tax positions, and other non-recurring adjustments. More specifically, the windfall tax adjustment for restricted stock awards recognized at a value higher than the grant date fair value is million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Penalties and interest accrued for uncertain tax positions was million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In addition, there was a one-time million decrease in accrued penalties and interest for the reversal of the uncertain tax position for Section 174 costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as discussed above. Further, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized a non-recurring million reduction to the state income tax payable. These factors increased the rate by for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and increased the rate by for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.

 Share Repurchases 
 On November 17, 2023, the board of directors authorized a million share repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to million of our common stock. On August 16, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized an increase to this repurchase authorization from million to million (collectively referred to as the "2023 Repurchase Authorization"). The authorization is effective through August 31, 2025. The execution of the repurchase program is expected to be consistent with the Company s strategic initiatives which prioritize investments in organic and acquisitive growth. The timing and amount of any share repurchases will be determined by management at its discretion based on several factors including share price, market conditions and capital allocation priorities. Shares may be repurchased from time to time through open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions or by other means, including the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, in accordance with applicable securities laws and other restrictions. The share repurchase program does not obligate Bowman to acquire a specific number of shares of common stock and may be suspended, modified, or discontinued at any time without notice. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased shares of common stock at an average price per share of , and has million remaining under the 2023 Repurchase Authorization.

 million, which was comprised of cash, promissory note, common stock and assumed liabilities. The shares are subject to a lock up. The promissory note bears a simple interest rate fixed at , and is payable in equal quarterly payments of principal and interest beginning July 2024 and ending July 2027. The merger agreement contains a contingent consideration feature which affords the sellers the opportunity to earn additional consideration in the form of the Company's common stock, depending on the average trading price of the Company's common stock for the 90 trading days post-acquisition. For tax purposes, the Surdex transaction is considered a tax-free merger, in which the assets have been recorded at their respective carrying values. As a result, there is no corresponding tax goodwill, and therefore no tax goodwill to be amortized or otherwise deductible.

 Other 2024 Acquisitions 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed additional acquisitions in diverse geographic regions and service lines. The Company paid total consideration of million through combinations of cash, promissory notes, shares of common stock and assumed liabilities. No cash was acquired with these acquisitions. Shares of common stock issued in connection with the acquisitions are subject to a lock-up. Promissory notes bear a simple interest rate ranging from to and are payable in quarterly payments of principal and interest beginning May 2024 and ending in August 2027. For tax purposes, depending on the transaction, the acquisitions were treated either as an asset acquisition, in which case the assets have been stepped up and recorded at their respective fair values, or a tax-free merger, in which case the assets have been recorded at their respective carrying values. Goodwill results from an assembled workforce, which does not qualify for separate recognition, as well as expected future synergies from combining operations. For asset acquisitions, all the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. For of the acquisitions, the purchase agreement includes a contingent consideration feature, which affords the sellers the opportunity to earn additional consideration in the form of the Company's common stock, cash and non-negotiable promissory notes, based on certain financial performance thresholds.

 Methods of Evaluation 
 We use a variety of financial and other information in monitoring the financial condition and operating performance of our business. Some of the information we use to evaluate our operations is financial information that is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), while other information may be financial in nature and either built upon GAAP results or may not be in accordance with GAAP (Non-GAAP). We use all this information together for planning and monitoring our operations, as well as determining certain management and employee compensation. 
 The Company operates as a single business segment represented by our core business of providing multi-disciplinary professional engineering solutions to customers. While we evaluate revenue and other key performance indicators relating to various divisions of labor, our leadership neither manages the business nor deliberately allocates resources by service line, geography, or end market. Our financial statements present results as a single operating segment. 
 
 Components of Income and Expense 
 Revenue 
 We generate revenue from services performed by our employees, pass-through fees from sub-consultants, and reimbursable contract costs. On our condensed consolidated financial statements, we report gross revenue, which represents total revenue billed to customers excluding taxes collected from customers. Gross revenue less revenue derived from pass-through sub-consultant fees, reimbursable expenses and other direct expenses represents our net service billing, or that portion of our gross revenue attributable to services performed by our employees. Our peers use the calculation underlying net service billing to normalize peer performance assessments and provide meaningful insight into trends over time. Refer to Other Financial Data, Non-GAAP measurements and Key Performance Indicators below for further discussion of the use of this non-GAAP financial measure. 
 We generally do not generate profit from the pass-through of sub-consultants and reimbursable expenses. As such, contract profitability is most heavily impacted by the mix of labor utilized to complete the tasks and the efficiency of those resources in completing the tasks. Our largest direct contract cost is consistently our labor. To grow our revenue and maximize overall profitability we carefully monitor and manage our cost of labor and the utilization thereof. Maintaining an optimal level of utilization on a balanced pool of growing labor resources represents our greatest prospect for delivering increasing profitability. 
 We enter into contracts that contain two types of pricing characteristics: 
 Hourly contracts , also referred to as time and materials, are common for professional and technical consulting assignments both short-term and multi-year in duration. Under these types of contracts, there is no predetermined maximum fee and we generally experience no risk associated with cost overruns. For hourly contracts, we negotiate billing rates and charge our customers based upon the actual hours expended toward a deliverable. These contracts may have not-to-exceed parameters requiring us to receive additional authorizations from our customer to continue working, but we likewise do not have to continue working without assurances of payment for such additional work. Hourly assignments represented approximately 9.8 million and 30.2 million or 9 and 10 of our gross contract revenue for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. For each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, hourly assignments represented approximately 11.4 million and 28.5 million or 12 and 11 of our gross contract revenue, respectively.

Table of Contents 

 Lump sum contracts , also referred to as fixed fee, typically require the performance of some, or all, of the obligations under the contract for a specified amount, subject to price adjustments only if the scope of the project changes or unforeseen requirements arise. Our fixed fee contracts generally include a specific scope of work and defined deliverables. Lump sum contracts can involve both hourly and fixed fee tasks. The majority of our assignments are lump sum in nature representing approximately 104.1 million and 283.1 million or 91 and 90 of our gross contract revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. For each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, assignments that are lump sum in nature represented approximately 83.0 million and 224.8 million or 88 and 89 of our gross contract revenue, respectively. Recognizing revenue from lump sum assignments requires management estimates of both total contract value when there are contingent compensation elements of the fee arrangement and expected cost at completion. We closely monitor our progress to completion and adjust our estimates when necessary. We do not recognize revenue from work that has no documented customer commitment and is performed at risk. 
 Contract Costs 
 Contract costs consist of direct payroll costs, sub-consultant costs and other direct expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization. 
 Direct payroll costs represent the portion of salaries and wages incurred in connection with the production of deliverables under customer assignments and contracts. Direct payroll costs include allocated fringe costs (i.e. health benefits, employer payroll taxes, and retirement plan contributions), paid leave and incentive compensation. 
 Sub-consultants and direct expenses include both sub-consultants and other outside costs associated with performance under our contracts. Sub-consultant and direct costs are generally reimbursable by our customers under the terms of our contracts. 
 Performance under our contracts does not involve significant machinery or other long term depreciable assets. Most of the equipment we employ involves desktop computers and other shared ordinary course IT equipment. We present direct costs exclusive of depreciation and amortization and as such we do not present gross profit on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Operating Expense 
 Operating expenses consist of selling, general and administrative costs, non-cash stock compensation, depreciation and amortization and settlements and other non-core expenses. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses represent corporate and other general overhead expenses, salaries and wages not allocated to customer projects including management and administrative personnel costs, incentive compensation, personal leave, office lease and occupancy costs, legal, professional and accounting fees. 
 Non-cash stock compensation represents the expenses incurred with respect to shares and options issued by the Company, both vested and unvested, to employees as long-term incentives. Non-cash stock compensation cost will be the grant date fair value of the awards, or the Black-Scholes-Merton value of stock options on the grant date, recognized ratably over the vesting period(s) of each award. Future non-cash stock compensation expense for unvested shares is the cumulative total of the unvested portion of all issued and outstanding awards and their individual grant date fair values. Stock awards will continue to be an important part of our long-term retention and rewards philosophy. 
 Depreciation and amortization represent the depreciation and amortization expense of our property and general IT equipment, capital lease assets, tenant improvements and intangible assets. 
 (Gain) loss on sale represents gains or losses inclusive of foreign exchange and accumulated depreciation recapture resulting from the disposal of an asset upon the sale or retirement of such asset.

 Other (Income) Expense 
 Other (income) expense consists of other non-operating and non-core expenses, including transaction related costs associated with acquisitions. 
 Tax (Benefit) Expense 
 Income tax (benefit) expense, current and deferred, includes estimated federal, state and local tax expense associated with our net income, as apportioned to the states in which we operate. Estimates of our tax expense include both current and deferred tax expense along with all available tax incentives and credits. 
 Other Financial Data, Non-GAAP Measurements and Key Performance Indicators 
 Backlog 
 We measure the value of our undelivered gross revenue in real time to calculate our backlog and predict future revenue. Backlog includes awarded, contracted, and otherwise secured commitments along with revenue we expect to realize over time for predictable long-term and reoccurring assignments. We report backlog quarterly as of the end of the last day of the reporting period. We use backlog to predict revenue growth and anticipate appropriate future staffing needs. Backlog definitions and methods of calculation vary within our industry. As such, backlog is not a reliable metric on which to evaluate us relative to our peers. Backlog neither derives from, nor reconciles to, any GAAP results. 
 Net Service Billing 
 In the normal course of providing services to our customers, we routinely subcontract services and incur direct third-party contract expenses that may or may not be reimbursable and may or may not be billed to customers with mark-up. Gross revenue less revenue derived from pass-through sub-consultant fees and reimbursable expenses represents our net service billing, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, and is the portion of our gross contract revenue attributable to services performed by our employees. Because the ratio of sub-contractor and direct expense costs to gross billing varies between contracts, gross revenue is not necessarily indicative of trends in our business. As a professional services company, we believe that metrics derived from net service billings more accurately demonstrate the productivity and profitability of our workforce than do those derived from gross revenue. Our industry uses the calculation of net service billing to normalize peer performance assessments and provide meaningful insight into trends over time. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 We view Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as an important indicator of normalized performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization, plus discontinued expenses, non-core legal settlements and other costs not in the ordinary course of business, non-cash stock-based compensation, and other acquisition related adjustments such as professional fees, fair value adjustments and working capital adjustments. Our peers may define Adjusted EBITDA differently. 
 Adjusted EBITDA Margin, net 
 Adjusted EBITDA Margin, net, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, represents Adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, as a percentage of net service billings, as defined above.

 Gross Contract Revenue 
 Gross contract revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased 19.5 million or 20.6 to 113.9 million as compared to 94.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, gross contract revenue attributable to work performed by our workforce increased 19.3 million, or 23.5 to 101.4 million or 89.0 of gross contract revenue as compared to 82.1 million or 87.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 see Net service billing non-GAAP ). Of the 19.5 million increase in gross contract revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024, acquisitions represented 23.3 million of the increase. To evaluate the Company s growth, revenue from acquisitions is treated as acquired for a period of four quarters post-closing, after which it is considered organic. For each measurement and comparison period, historical balances of acquired and organic revenue bases are adjusted to reflect revenue accordingly.

 3 Includes periodic reclassifications of revenue between categories from prior periods for consistency of presentation. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, gross contract revenue from our building infrastructure market increased 4.3 million or 8.2 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Building Infrastructure includes commercial, municipal and residential infrastructure. The increase in building infrastructure revenue is the result of acquisitions. Within the building infrastructure market, 39.3 of gross contract revenue was derived from residential assignments including single family, multi-family and mixed-use housing stock, 42.9 from commercial assignments including retail, hospitality and quick-serve restaurants (QSR), office and industrial, data centers and healthcare, and 17.7 from municipal assignments, including parks and schools. Within residential, 59.8 of gross contract revenue was derived from for-sale homebuilding assignments, 35.7 from residential multi-family and 4.5 from mixed use projects. While the homebuilding market shows signs of rebounding from prior year interest rate impacts, for-sale residential services represented just 11.6 of our total gross contract revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Within commercial, 36.7 of revenue was derived from office and industrial assignments, 41.3 from retail, hospitality, and quick serve restaurants, 15.7 from data centers, and 6.2 from healthcare. We continue to experience strong demand for our building infrastructure services and maintain a positive outlook on this market as we continue to experience strength in markets including data centers, quick serve restaurants, industrial distribution facilities, schools, and build-for-rent communities. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenue from transportation increased 2.1 million or 10.5 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was attributable to new contract awards in transportation both from public and private customers along with acquired transportation backlog which we were able to deliver to customers, within transportation, 64.5 of our gross contract revenue was derived directly from public sector customers including state and local departments of transportation ("DOTs"), tollway operators, transit authorities aviation operators and others with the remaining 35.5 derived from private sector customers. We expect to continue to increase our transportation revenue and improve the diversification of our revenue. We believe the transportation market continues to present significant opportunity for future growth and we remain committed to investing in leadership, technical expertise, business development and acquisitions for this market. 
 With the convergence of renewable energy with traditional transmission infrastructure and the continued growth we are projecting in the clean energy transition, we have consolidated renewable energy into the power and utilities category (sometimes referred to herein as the power, utilities and energy market) of our revenue mix and have adjusted historical balances accordingly. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenue from power and utilities increased 1.5 million or 7.8 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The additional increase in gross contract revenue from the power and utilities market is principally attributable to acquisitions and increased revenue associated with the expansion of a multi-year utility undergrounding assignment in Florida, along with additional increases derived from gas pipeline and electric transmission projects nationally. Within the power and utilities market, 73.8 of our gross contract revenue was derived from customers operating traditional power operations and 26.2 was derived from customers focused on renewables, electric vehicle ("EV") infrastructure and energy transition operations. The power and utilities market continues to experience increasing infrastructure investment as changing weather patterns, energy transition mandates and other safety initiatives positively impact demand for the services we provide. Based on recent increases in program commitments within the gas pipeline replacement market, we believe trends in power and utilities provide meaningful opportunity for continued growth and we are committed to investing resources accordingly. 
 Our other emerging markets consist of mining, water resources, imaging and mapping, environmental consulting, and other natural resources services. Adjusted for the change, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenue from emerging markets increased 11.7 million or 280.5 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase is primarily due to the acquisition of Surdex Corporation; see Note 4 - Acquisitions for additional information. Emerging market sectors represent lines of business that have not yet grown to a size whereby we would distinguish them as a separate market. Gross contract revenue within our emerging markets was 54.0 from imaging and mapping activities, 12.9 from mining activities where we have specialized in copper mining, 25.3 from water resources activities, and 7.8 from environmental and other natural resources consulting. Scarcities in water resources and the increasing need for water management gives us confidence that we will be able to increase revenue accordingly. With recent and future acquisitions, we expect to experience continued growth from investment in various emerging market services. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, public sector customers, defined as direct contracts with municipalities, public agencies, or governmental authorities, represented 32.3 and 14.8 of our gross contract revenue, respectively. A portion of that increase is due to the reclassification of contracts for the Pike Corporation from the private

 sector to the public sector. This does not include work done indirectly on public sector projects. Gross contract revenue from projects for public sector clients are included in the end market most aligned with work performed. 
 Contract costs (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 
 Total contract costs, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased 8.6 million or 18.8 to 54.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 45.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, total contract costs represented 47.7 and 48.4 of total contract revenue, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 total contract costs represented 53.6 and 55.6 of revenue attributable to our workforce, respectively (see Net Service Billing). 
 Direct payroll costs increased 8.3 million or 24.9 to 41.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 33.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Direct payroll accounted for 76.8 of total contract costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 3.7 percentage points as compared to 73.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Direct labor, the component of direct payroll costs associated with the cost of labor relating to work performed on contracts increased 5.8 million or 22.8 to 31.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 25.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in direct labor is primarily due to an increase in staffing to accommodate growth. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, direct labor costs represented 27.4 and 26.9 of gross contract revenue, respectively and represented 30.8 and 30.9 of the revenue attributable to our workforce, respectively. 
 Other direct payroll costs, the component of direct payroll costs associated with fringe and incentive compensation (cash and non-cash) increased by 2.6 million or 32.5 to 10.6 million as compared to 8.0 million. 
 Sub-consultants and other direct expenses increased 0.3 million or 2.4 to 12.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 12.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, sub-consultant and other direct expenses represented 11.1 and 13.0 of gross contract revenue, respectively. This decrease is not indicative of an anticipated long-term shift in the composition of our gross contract revenue, and we expect to experience periodic volatility in concentration of sub-consultant utilization. 
 Operating Expense 
 Total operating expense increased 13.1 million or 28.4 to 59.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 46.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10.2 million or 24.5 to 51.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 41.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Indirect labor increased 4.5 million or 23.6 to 23.6 million as compared to 19.1 million primarily due to an increase in staffing to accommodate growth. General overhead increased 4.3 million or 32.6 to 17.5 million as compared to 13.2 million due to increased costs associated with the overall growth of the Company. 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 2.9 million or 64.4 to 7.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase is primarily due to an increase in intangible assets and assets leased under financing arrangements. We continue to increase the use of our finance lease facility as we continue to grow. Intangible assets have increased due to multiple acquisitions. Gains on the sale of certain IT equipment and automobiles remained 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other (Income) Expense 
 Other expense increased by 0.1 million to 1.6 million of expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Net service billing (non-GAAP) 
 Net service billing increased 19.3 million or 23.5 to 101.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 82.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net service billing reconciles to gross contract revenue as follows (in thousands):

 Gross contract revenue 113,932 94,434 Less: sub-consultants and other direct expenses 12,569 12,310 Net service billing 101,363 82,124 
 
 Because sub-consultants and reimbursable expenses are most often pass-through items with little or no mark-up, they generally have a dilutive effect on gross, operating, and net margins while having little accretive effect on profitability. As such, where possible, we focus our resources and business development efforts principally on increasing revenue derived from our own workforce. Management primarily focuses its internal performance metrics on net service billing.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross contract revenue from our building infrastructure market increased 20.9 million or 14.4 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Building infrastructure includes commercial, municipal and residential infrastructure. The increase in building infrastructure revenue is the result of acquisitions. Within the building infrastructure market, 34.8 of gross contract revenue was derived from residential assignments including single family, multi-family and mixed-use housing stock, 45.3 from commercial assignments including retail, hospitality and quick-serve restaurants (QSR), office and industrial, data centers and healthcare, and 19.9 from municipal assignments including, parks and schools. Within residential, 53.3 of gross contract revenue was derived from for-sale homebuilding assignments, 40.3 from residential multi-family and 6.4 from mixed use projects. While the homebuilding market shows signs of rebounding from prior year interest rate impacts, for-sale residential services represented just 9.8 of our total gross contract revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Within commercial, 35.8 of revenue was derived from office and industrial assignments, 40.6 from retail, hospitality, and quick serve restaurants, 14.5 from data centers, and 9.1 from healthcare. We continue to experience strong demand for our building infrastructure services and maintain a positive outlook on this market as we continue to experience strength in markets including data centers, quick serve restaurants, industrial distribution facilities, schools, and build-for-rent communities. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue from transportation increased 8.5 million or 16.4 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was attributable to new contract awards in transportation both from public and private customers along with acquired transportation backlog which we were able to deliver to customers, within transportation, 62.0 of our gross contract revenue was derived directly from public sector customers including state and local departments of transportation ("DOTs"), tollway operators, transit authorities, aviation operators and others with the remaining 38.0 derived from private sector customers. We expect to continue to increase our transportation revenue and improve the diversification of our revenue. We believe the transportation market continues to present significant opportunity for future growth and we remain committed to investing in leadership, technical expertise, business development and acquisitions for this market. 
 With the convergence of renewable energy with traditional transmission infrastructure and the continued growth we are projecting in the clean energy transition, we have consolidated renewable energy into the power and utilities category (sometimes referred to herein as the power, utilities and energy market) of our revenue mix and have adjusted historical balances accordingly. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue from power and utilities increased 8.8 million or 18.4 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The additional increase in gross contract revenue from the power and utilities market is principally attributable to acquisitions and increased revenue associated with the expansion of a multi-year utility undergrounding assignment in Florida, and to increases derived from gas pipeline and electric transmission projects nationally. Within the power and utilities market, 75.6 of our gross contract revenue was derived from customers operating traditional power operations and 24.4 was derived from customers focused on renewables, electric vehicle ("EV") infrastructure and energy transition operations. The power and utilities market continues to experience increasing infrastructure investment as changing weather patterns, energy transition mandates and other safety initiatives positively impact demand for the services we provide. Based on recent increases in program

 commitments within the gas pipeline replacement market, we believe trends in power and utilities provide meaningful opportunity for continued growth and we are committed to investing resources accordingly. 
 Our other emerging markets consist of mining, water resources, imaging and mapping, environmental consulting, and other natural resources services. Adjusted for the change, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue from emerging markets increased 22.0 million or 236.5 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase is primarily due to the acquisition of Surdex Corporation; see Note 4 - Acquisitions for additional information. Emerging market sectors represent lines of business that have not yet grown to a size whereby we would distinguish them as a separate market. Gross contract revenue within our emerging markets was 43.8 from imaging and mapping activities, 19.7 from mining activities where we have specialized in copper mining, 27.6 from water resources activities, and 8.9 from environmental and other natural resources consulting. Scarcities in water resources and the increasing need for water management gives us confidence that we will be able to increase revenue accordingly. With recent and future acquisitions, we expect to experience continued growth from investment in various emerging market services. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, public sector customers, defined as direct contracts with municipalities, public agencies, or governmental authorities, represented 26.0 and 12.8 of our gross contract revenue, respectively. A portion of that increase is due to the reclassification of contracts for the Pike Corporation from the private sector to the public sector. This does not include work done indirectly on public sector projects. Gross contract revenue from projects for public sector clients are included in the end market most aligned with work performed. 
 Contract costs (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 
 Total contract costs, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased 26.7 million or 21.5 to 150.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 124.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, total contract costs represented 48.1 and 49.0 of total contract revenue, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 total contract costs represented 53.7 and 55.5 of revenue attributable to our workforce, respectively (see Net Service Billing). 
 Direct payroll costs increased 24.2 million or 25.7 to 118.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 94.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Direct payroll accounted for 78.6 of total contract costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 2.6 percentage points as compared to 76.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Direct labor, the component of direct payroll costs associated with the cost of labor relating to work performed on contracts increased 17.5 million or 24.8 to 88.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 70.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in direct labor is primarily due to an increase in staffing to accommodate growth. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, direct labor costs represented 28.1 and 27.9 of gross contract revenue, respectively and represented 31.4 and 31.6 of the revenue attributable to our workforce, respectively. 
 Other direct payroll costs, the component of direct payroll costs associated with fringe and incentive compensation (cash and non-cash) increased by 6.6 million or 27.8 to 30.3 million as compared to 23.7 million. This increase includes a 1.6 million increase in non-cash stock compensation as several new stock awards were granted to Company leadership as well as employees in connection with acquisitions. Also, stock compensation has become a larger part of our employee incentive plans. 
 Sub-consultants and other direct expenses increased 2.5 million or 8.4 to 32.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 29.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, sub-consultant and other direct expenses represented 10.3 and 11.8 of gross contract revenue, respectively. This decrease is not indicative of an anticipated long-term shift in the composition of our gross contract revenue, and we expect to experience periodic volatility in concentration of sub-consultant utilization. 
 Operating Expense 
 Total operating expense increased 39.8 million or 31.5 to 166.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 126.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 32.1 million or 28.2 to 145.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 113.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Indirect labor 
 42 

Table of Contents 

 increased 14.8 million or 29.2 to 65.4 million as compared to 50.6 million primarily due to an increase in staffing to accommodate growth. General overhead increased 12.4 million or 33.6 to 49.3 million as compared to 36.9 million due to increased costs associated with the overall growth of the Company. 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 7.8 million or 60.9 to 20.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 12.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase is primarily due to an increase in intangible assets and assets leased under financing arrangements. We continue to increase the use of our finance lease facility as we continue to grow. Intangible assets have increased due to multiple acquisitions. Gains on the sale of certain IT equipment and automobiles increased 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other (Income) Expense 
 Other expense increased by 2.1 million to 6.0 million of expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 3.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase is primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense of 2.3 million due to an increase in finance leases and notes payable. 
 Income Tax Benefit 
 Income tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 4.6 million to a 6.5 million benefit, as compared to 1.9 million benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, see note 2, Income Taxes. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is 69.5 as compared to 233.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Income (Loss) Before Tax and Net Income (Loss) 
 Loss before tax increased by 8.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, to 9.4) million of loss compared to 0.8) million of loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net loss increased by 4.0 million to 2.9) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.1 million of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other financial information and Non-GAAP key performance indicators 
 Net service billing (non-GAAP) 
 Net service billing increased 57.5 million or 25.7 to 281.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 223.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net service billing reconciles to gross contract revenue as follows (in thousands): 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 2023 
 Gross contract revenue 313,341 253,290 Less: sub-consultants and other direct expenses 32,308 29,811 Net service billing 281,033 223,479 
 
 Because sub-consultants and reimbursable expenses are most often pass-through items with little or no mark-up, they generally have a dilutive effect on gross, operating, and net margins while having little accretive effect on profitability. As such, where possible, we focus our resources and business development efforts principally on increasing revenue derived from our own workforce. Management primarily focuses its internal performance metrics on net service billing.

Backlog (other key performance metrics) 
 Our backlog increased 74.1 million or 24.2 to 379.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 305.7 million at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 our backlog was comprised as follows: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Building Infrastructure 
 46 55 Transportation 29 24 Power Utilities 15 17 Other Emerging Markets 10 4 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents balances, cash flow from operations, borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below), lease financing, proceeds from stock sales and other structured debt securities. Our principal uses of cash are operating expenses, working capital requirements, capital 
 44 

Table of Contents 

 expenditures, repayment of debt, acquisitions, and acquisition related payments. On September 30, 2024, we maintained a 100.0 million Revolving Credit Facility with Bank of America N.A., our primary lender. See - "Credit Facilities and Other Financing" below for more information on our Revolving Credit Facility. Under the terms of our Revolving Credit Facility, available cash in our primary operating account sweeps against the outstanding balance every evening. Our cash on hand therefore generally consisted of petty cash and other non-operating funds not included in the nightly sweep. Cash on hand included the cash we kept in short-term investment accounts along with deposits and payments in transit in our operating sweep account. Our cash on hand decreased by 9.0 million on September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023. 
 We regularly monitor our capital requirements and believe our sources of liquidity, including cash flow from operations, existing cash, and borrowing availability under our credit and lease facilities will be sufficient to fund our projected cash requirements and strategic initiatives for the next year. To the extent we experience any potential liquidity or capital shortfalls relating to growth and acquisition, we currently expect to rely on debt financing to meet those shortfalls. We use our equity as a component of consideration in acquisitions. In addition, depending on market conditions, we may opportunistically access the public debts and equity markets. 
 We are actively pursuing acquisitions as part of our strategic growth initiative. At any given time, we are assessing multiple opportunities at varying stages of due diligence. These acquisition opportunities range in size, timing of closing, valuation, and composition of consideration. In connection with acquisitions, we use a combination of cash, bank financing, seller financing, and equity to satisfy the purchase price. Currently, we have several acquisitions under consideration. There can be no assurance that any opportunity in the process of being reviewed will close but we expect over time to utilize a meaningful portion of our current liquidity and capital resources for acquisitions. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented: 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (amounts in thousands) 2024 
 2023 
 Net cash provided by operating activities 12,382 12,271 Net cash used in investing activities (23,636) (16,999) Net cash provided by financing activities 2,227 5,877 Change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (9,027) 1,149 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period 11,660 14,431 
 Operating Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 12.4 million, which primarily consisted of 2.9) million net loss, adjusted for stock-based compensation expense of 20.3 million and depreciation and amortization expense of 20.6 million, offset by deferred taxes of 18.4) million and a net cash outflow of 8.4) million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The net outflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a 10.8 million increase in accounts receivable resulting from a combination of acquired accounts receivable from acquisitions and an increased billing to our clients, a 6.9 million increase in contract assets and liabilities, and a 6.4 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses partially offset by a 2.9 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was 12.3 million, which primarily consisted of our 1.1 million net income, adjusted for stock-based compensation expense of 18.3 million, depreciation and amortization expense of 12.8 million, and deferred taxes of 11.1) million, offset by a net cash outflow of 9.5) million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was 21.8 million. The net outflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a 14.6 million increase in accounts receivable resulting from increased billing to our clients, a 4.4 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, and 10.3 million increase in contract assets and liabilities, partially offset by a 19.8 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses.

 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased by 6.6 million to 23.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 17.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net cash used for investing is primarily attributable to acquisitions that occurred in the first three quarters of 2024. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.2 million compared to 5.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 3.7 million. The decrease in net cash provided by financing is primarily attributable to the net proceeds of 47.2 million from the common stock offering, 4.6 million from finance leases, 1.5 million from issuance of common stock, offset by the 13.0 million used for repayment of the revolving line of credit and the fixed line, 11.0 million used for repayment of notes and 11.1 million used to purchase treasury shares. 
 
 Credit Facilities and Other Financing 
 
 On May 2, 2024 the Company and certain of its subsidiaries as guarantors entered into a new credit agreement with lenders, Bank of America N.A, as Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender and L/C Issuer, and TD Bank, N.A. as syndication agent (the New Credit Agreement which provides for a new 100 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility ). The Revolving Credit Facility replaced the Company s previous 70.0 million revolving credit facility (the "2022 Revolving Credit Facility"), and its non-revolving fixed line of credit ("Fixed Line #2") with Bank of America, N.A. In addition, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a Security and Pledge Agreement, dated as of May 2, 2024, with Bank of America, N.A., in its capacity as Administrative Agent. The New Credit Agreement is secured by all the assets of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors. 
 Under the New Credit Agreement, the Company is required to comply with certain covenants, including covenants on indebtedness, investments, liens and restricted payments, as well as maintain certain financial covenants, including a fixed charge coverage ratio and leverage ratio of debt to EBITDA (as defined in the New Credit Agreement). At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants. 
 All outstanding principal on the Revolving Credit Facility is due on May 2, 2029. On September 30, 2024, the interest rates on the Revolving Credit Facility ranged from 7.22 to 9.20 . As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility was 32.3 million. 
 We utilize master lease facilities primarily with Honour Capital LLC Honour and Enterprise Leasing Enterprise ). The Honour Capital lease facility finances our acquisition of IT infrastructure, geospatial and survey equipment, aircraft cameras and related equipment, furniture and other long-lived assets. On May 3, 2024, the Company s wholly owned subsidiary, Surdex Corporation, entered into an Aircraft Loan and Security Agreement, Promissory Note and related transaction documents, with Wingspire Finance LLC pursuant to which Surdex borrowed approximately 6.3 million secured by a pledge of its aircraft, aircraft engines and other equipment. The Company guaranteed the obligations of Surdex under the financing agreements. 
 The Enterprise lease facility finances the acquisition of field trucks and other service vehicles. At September 30, 2024, we maintained a fleet of approximately 600 vehicles. All our leasing facilities allow for both operating and finance leasing. We allocate finance lease payments between amortization and interest. The payment terms on the lease agreements range between 30 and 50 months with payments totaling approximately 1.0 million per month. We utilize a third party valuation specialist to formulate the incremental borrowing rates for the Company, to calculate the present value on new leases. 
 We regularly evaluate our options with respect to capital and our requirements for operations and growth. We do not limit our consideration to traditional bank financing, but rather include other structured debt and equity as option for additional capital. 
 For more information about our credit facilities, see Note 11 Revolving Credit Facility and Fixed Credit Facilities. 
 Registration Statement

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to certain market risks from transactions that are entered into during the normal course of business. We have not entered into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. We have no significant market risk exposure to interest rate changes related to the promissory notes issued as partial consideration for acquisitions since these contain fixed interest rates. Our only debt subject to interest rate risk is the New Credit Agreement under which rates are tied to Term SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate), plus an applicable rate which varies between 2.10 and 2.60 based on our ratio of Funded Debt to EBITDA (as each is defined in the New Credit Agreement). As of September 30, 2024, there was 32.3 million outstanding on the Credit Agreement. A one percentage point change in the assumed interest rate of the New Credit Agreement would change our annual interest expense by approximately 0.3 million in 2024. 
 Our finance lease obligations with Honour and Enterprise were 28.6 million as of September 30, 2024. These finance lease obligations bear interest at a fixed rate. Accordingly, there is no exposure to market risk related to these obligations.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

The Company shall bear all costs that Independent Advisor may incur in connection with any calculations contemplated by this Section. Any reduction of the Payments payable hereunder, if applicable, shall be made by first reducing the 
 8 

cash payments under Section 7, second by reducing COBRA reimbursement and lastly by reducing any other Payments in a manner determined by the Company, in consultation with Executive in accordance with Code Section 409A. 
 (c) If Executive is determined to be entitled to a Reduced Amount pursuant to Section 8(a) and, notwithstanding any reduction described in this Section 8 (or in the absence of any such reduction), the Internal Revenue Service IRS determines that Executive is liable for the Excise Tax as a result of the receipt of one or more Payments, then Executive shall be obligated to surrender or pay back to the Company, within one hundred twenty (120) days after a final IRS determination, an amount of such payments or benefits equal to the Repayment Amount . The Repayment Amount with respect to such Payments shall be the smallest such amount, if any, as shall be required to be surrendered or paid to the Company so that Executive s net proceeds with respect to such Payments (after taking into account the payment of the excise tax imposed on such Payments) shall be maximized. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Repayment Amount with respect to such Payments shall be zero if a Repayment Amount of more than zero would not eliminate the Excise Tax imposed on such Payments or if a Repayment Amount of more than zero would not maximize the net amount received by Executive from the Payments. If the Excise Tax is not eliminated pursuant to this Section 8, Executive shall pay the Excise Tax. 
 
 Section 9. Restrictive Covenants . Executive acknowledges and recognizes the highly competitive nature of the businesses of the Company and accordingly agrees, as a condition of Executive s continued employment with the Company, to be bound by and comply with the Restrictive Covenants contained in Appendix B attached hereto and incorporated by reference herein. Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Company s remedies at law for a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of Section 1 of Appendix B or a material breach or material threatened breach of any of the provisions of Section 2 of Appendix B of this Agreement would be inadequate and the Company would suffer irreparable damages as a result of such breach or threatened breach. In recognition of this fact, Executive agrees that, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, in addition to any remedies at law, the Company, without posting any bond, shall be entitled to obtain equitable relief in the form of specific performance, temporary restraining order, temporary or permanent injunction or any other equitable remedy which may then be available. 
 
 Section 10. Representation and Warranty of Executive . Executive represents and warrants to the Company that Executive has had the opportunity to consult with, and is represented by, his own tax and legal advisor(s) in connection with the negotiation and preparation of this Agreement. 
 
 Section 11. Taxes . The Company may withhold from any payments made under this Agreement all applicable taxes, including but not limited to income, employment, and social insurance taxes, as shall be required by law. Executive acknowledges and represents that the Company has not provided any tax advice to him in connection with this Agreement and that he has been advised by the Company to seek tax advice from his own tax advisors regarding this Agreement and payments that may be made to him pursuant to this Agreement, including specifically, the application of the provisions of Section 409A of the Code to such payments.

On the first business day following the expiration of the Specified Employee Delay Period, Executive shall be paid, in a single cash lump sum, an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all payments delayed pursuant to the preceding sentence, and any remaining payments not so delayed shall continue to be paid pursuant to the payment schedule set forth herein. 
 
 (b) Each payment in a series of payments hereunder shall be deemed to be a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code.

 (d) The payments and benefits provided hereunder are intended to be structured in a manner to avoid the implication of any penalty taxes under Section 409A of the Code and shall be interpreted consistent with such intent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event whatsoever shall the Company be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalties that may be imposed on Executive as a result of Section 409A of the Code or any damages for failing to comply with Section 409A of the Code (other than for withholding obligations or other obligations applicable to employers, if any, under Section 409A of the Code). If any provision of this Agreement (or of any award of compensation, including equity compensation or benefits) would cause Executive to incur any additional tax or interest under Section 409A of the Code, the Company shall, after consulting with and receiving the approval of Executive, reform such provision in a manner intended (but not guaranteed by the Company) to avoid the incurrence by Executive of any such additional tax or interest.
