 Gross unrealized losses may fluctuate quarter over quarter due to factors in the market that affect our holdings, such as changes in interest rates or credit spreads. The Company considers many factors when determining whether an allowance for a credit loss should be recorded. While the Company holds securities that may be in an unrealized loss position from time to time, Globe Life does not generally intend to sell and it is unlikely that the Company will be required to sell the fixed maturities prior to their anticipated recovery or maturity due to the strong cash flows generated by its insurance operations.

complainants were employees, not independent contractors, of Globe Life Inc. and/or American Income and were discriminated against on the basis of sex, and that one complainant was also discriminated against on the basis of race. In addition, the EEOC asserts that there is reasonable cause to believe that a class of female workers were employees, not independent contractors, and were subject to unlawful conduct which also constitutes a pattern-or-practice of discrimination. The EEOC s investigative findings are not binding on Globe Life Inc. The EEOC s procedures provide for a conciliation process that has recently concluded without achieving a resolution. The EEOC may elect to file a lawsuit in federal court on behalf of the workers based on the alleged statutory violations. The EEOC has not filed any legal proceedings at this time. In the event the EEOC elects to pursue any claims in court, Globe Life Inc. intends to defend against any such lawsuit vigorously. The outcome of litigation of this type would be inherently uncertain and cannot be reasonably estimated or determined at this time. There is always the possibility that a Court rules in a manner that is adverse to the interests of Globe Life Inc.

 The Company performs an annual review of its assumptions during the third quarter. This review process resulted in favorable changes to its mortality and lapse assumptions on life and unfavorable changes to morbidity assumptions on health. Generally, in our life segment mortality assumptions were decreased across most channels in line with recent experience consistent with decreasing levels of excess deaths. Also, for the life segment lapse rate assumptions were slightly increased across all channels. For the health segment, morbidity assumptions were increased, causing higher future policy benefit reserves. The assumption review process of the life and health segments resulted in a million net remeasurement gain as compared to a million net remeasurement gain in the year-ago quarter. 
 
 Excluding the impact of assumption changes, the Company's results for actual variances from expected experience for both life and health produced a million net remeasurement gain and a million net remeasurement gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company's results for actual variances from expected experience for both life and health produced a million net remeasurement gain and a million net remeasurement gain, respectively.

segments: life insurance, supplemental health insurance, annuities, and investments. In addition, other expenses not included in these segments are reported in "Corporate Other." 
 
 Globe Life's reportable insurance segments are based on the insurance product lines it markets and administers: life insurance, supplemental health insurance, and annuities. These major product lines are set out as reportable segments because of the common characteristics of products within these categories, comparability of margins, and the similarity in regulatory environment and management techniques. There is also an investment segment that manages the investment portfolio and cash flow for the insurance segments and the corporate function. The Company's chief operating decision makers evaluate the overall performance of the operations of the Company in accordance with these segments. 
 
 Life insurance products marketed by Globe Life include traditional whole life and term life insurance. Health insurance products are generally guaranteed renewable and include Medicare Supplement, cancer, critical illness, accident, and other limited-benefit supplemental hospital and surgical products. Annuities include fixed-benefit contracts.

 Due to the nature of the life insurance industry, Globe Life has no individual or group that would be considered a major customer. Substantially all of Globe Life's business is conducted in the United States. 
 
 The measure of profitability established by the chief operating decision makers for the insurance segments is underwriting margin before other income and administrative expenses, in accordance with the manner in which the segments are managed. It essentially represents gross profit margin on insurance products before insurance administrative expenses and consists primarily of premium less net policy benefits, acquisition expenses, and commissions. Required interest on policy liabilities is reflected as a component of the Investment segment (rather than as a component of underwriting margin in the insurance and annuity segments) in order to match this cost with the investment income earned on the assets supporting the policy liabilities. 
 
 The measure of profitability for the Investment segment is excess investment income, representing the income earned on the investment portfolio in excess of policy requirements. Other than the required interest on the insurance segments, no other intersegment revenues or expenses are recognized. Expenses directly attributable to corporate operations are included in the Corporate Other category. Stock-based compensation expense is considered a corporate expense by Globe Life management and is included in this category. All other unallocated revenues and expenses on a pretax basis, including insurance administrative expense and interest on debt, are also included in the Corporate Other segment category. 
 
 Globe Life holds a sizable investment portfolio to support its insurance liabilities, the yield from which is used to offset policy benefit, acquisition, administrative, and tax expenses. This yield or investment income is taken into account when establishing premium rates and profitability expectations for its insurance products. From time to time, investments are sold or called, or experience a credit loss event, each of which are reflected by the Company as realized gain (loss) investments. These gains or losses generally occur as a result of disposition due to issuer calls, compliance with Company investment policies, or other reasons often beyond management s control. Unlike investment income, realized gains and losses are incidental to insurance operations, and only overall yields are considered when setting premium rates or insurance product profitability expectations. While these gains and losses

 Results of Operations 

How Globe Life Views Its Operations. Globe Life Inc. is the holding company for a group of insurance companies that market primarily individual life and supplemental health insurance to lower middle to middle-income households throughout the United States. We view our operations by segments, which are the insurance product lines of life, supplemental health, and annuities, and the investment segment that supports the product lines. Segments are aligned based on their common characteristics, comparability of the profit margins, and management techniques used to operate each segment. 
 
 Insurance Product Line Segments. The insurance product line segments involve the marketing, underwriting, and administration of policies. Each product line is further segmented by the various distribution channels that market the insurance policies. Each distribution channel operates in a niche market offering insurance products designed for that particular market. Whether analyzing profitability of a segment as a whole, or the individual distribution channels within the segment, the measure of profitability used by management is the underwriting margin, as seen below: 
 
 Premium revenue 
 (Policy obligations) 
 (Policy acquisition costs and commissions) 
 Underwriting margin 

Investment Segment. The investment segment involves the management of our capital resources, including investments and the management of liquidity. Our measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income, as seen below: 
 Net investment income 
 (Required interest on policy liabilities) 
 Excess investment income

 Current Highlights. 
 Net income as a return on equity (ROE) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 22.4 and net operating income as an ROE, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (1) was 15.3 . 
 Total premium increased 5 over the same period in the prior year. Life premium increased 4 for the period from 2.34 billion in 2023 to 2.44 billion in 2024. 
 Net investment income increased 9 over the same period in the prior year. 
 Total net sales increased 9 over the same period in the prior year from 568 million in 2023 to 622 million in 2024. The average producing agent count across all of the exclusive agencies increased 12 over the prior year. 
 Book value per share increased 13 over the same period in the prior year from 48.51 to 54.65. Book value per share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (1) , increased 13 over the prior year from 74.31 in 2023 to 83.92 in 2024. 
 The following graphs represent net income and net operating income for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 (1) As shown in the charts above, net operating income is the consolidated total of segment profits after tax and as such is considered a non-GAAP measure. It has been used consistently by Globe Life's management for many years to evaluate the operating performance of the Company. It differs from net income primarily because it excludes certain non-operating items such as realized gains and losses and certain significant and unusual items included in net income. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. 
 Net operating income as an ROE, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), is considered a non-GAAP measure. Management utilizes this measure to view the business without the effect of changes in AOCI, which are primarily attributable to fluctuation in interest rates. The impact of the adjustment to exclude AOCI is (2.48) billion and (2.46) billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Book value per share, excluding AOCI, is also considered a non-GAAP measure. Management utilizes this measure to view the book value of the business without the effect of changes in AOCI, which are primarily attributable to fluctuation in interest rates. The impact of the adjustment to exclude AOCI is (29.27) and (25.80) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 Management's Discussion Analysis 

 Summary of Operations. Net income increased 17 to 816 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 696 million in the same period in 2023. On a diluted per common share basis, net income per common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 24 from 7.20 to 8.93. 
 
 Net operating income increased 11 to 843 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 759 million for the same period in 2023, due to a 33 increase in excess investment income as well as a 15 increase in life underwriting margin. On a diluted per common share basis, net operating income per common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased from 7.85 to 9.23, an 18 increase. Net operating income is the consolidated total of segment profits after tax and as such is considered a non-GAAP measure. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. We do not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of our core insurance operations or operating segments. Additionally, net income was affected by certain non-operating items. We do not view these items as components of core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations. We remove items such as these that relate to prior periods or are non-operating items when evaluating the results of current operations, and therefore exclude such items from our segment analysis for current periods. 
 
 Net operating income is primarily comprised of insurance underwriting margin plus excess investment income, offset by operating expenses. As previously noted, a component of insurance underwriting margin is policy obligations, which includes for each reporting period the change in the liability for future policy benefits (LFPB). The LFPB is determined each reporting period based on the net level premium method. Net level premiums reflect a recomputed net premium ratio using actual experience since the issue date, and expected future experience based on future cash-flow assumptions. See Note 6 Policy Liabilities for additional information. The policy liability is accrued as premium revenue is recognized and adjusted for differences between actual and expected experience in the form of remeasurement gains and losses during the period. If actual mortality, morbidity, and lapse experience equals our expected assumptions used in the development of our liability for future policy benefits, there would be no impact to our financial results. Actual experience can have a material impact on financial results to the extent it significantly deviates from the expected assumptions which are used to develop our estimates of the liability for future policy benefits and amortization of the deferred acquisition cost asset (DAC). For example, deviations in actual versus expected lapses in the early policy years tend to have a larger impact on DAC amortization than LFPB change in reserves. Conversely, deviations in actual versus expected lapses in the later policy years typically have a larger impact on LFPB change in reserves than DAC amortization. This is due to the release of DAC and LFPB where DAC capitalization in earlier years is amortizing over time and the LFPB is increasing over time as the policy stays inforce. Disaggregated rollforwards of our present value of expected future net premiums and our expected future policy benefits are presented within Note 6 Policy Liabilities , which include disclosure of remeasurement gain (loss) for the effect of actual variances from expected experience and the changes in assumptions (mortality, morbidity, and lapses) on future cash flows. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the Company performed its annual assumptions review and updated both its life and health assumptions of lapses, mortality, and morbidity resulting in a 46.3 million net remeasurement gain as compared to a 3.2 million net remeasurement gain in the year-ago quarter. 
 
 Excluding the impact of assumption changes, the Company's results for actual variances from expected experience for both life and health produced a 14.7 million net remeasurement gain and a 15.9 million net remeasurement gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company's results for actual variances from expected experience for both life and health produced a 38.4 million net remeasurement gain and a 21.6 million net remeasurement gain, respectively.

 GLOBE LIFE INC. 
 Management's Discussion Analysis 

 Excluding our Direct to Consumer Division, we sell our policies primarily through independently contracted agents agents who earn commissions in accordance with contracts they have with the respective insurance subsidiary of the Company. These contract arrangements with agents cover commission structures and rates, contract periods, credit terms for settlement of agent advance accounts, vesting rights in future renewal commissions upon termination of contracts and responsibility for premium collections. Contract terms with agents vary, but generally commissions are earned over the life of the policy as premiums are paid. Commissions are calculated on a policy-by-policy basis and vary by product type and policy year. Commission rates are higher for the first-year premium when a policy is issued and are generally reduced for policies that remain in effect for renewal periods (e.g., commission rates may reduce in years 2-10 and again in year 11 and after). After a certain period (typically 10 years), commission rates become constant over the remaining life of the policy and are considered level commissions. 
 
 Generally, commissions are paid to an agent when due over the life of a policy as premiums are paid. However, some agents may qualify to have their commissions (primarily first-year commissions) paid in advance of when the commissions are earned. To the extent an advance is made, we will generally advance up to 65 of first year commissions. This creates an agent debit balance which is classified within Other receivables in the consolidated financial statements. If an agent has an agent debit balance with the Company, commissions earned by that agent are generally first applied to reduce the amounts owed the company. Any excess will be paid to the agent in cash. 
 
 Commissions are earned by the agent over the contract period as long as premium is paid by the policyholder and the policy stays in force. As the commissions are earned by the agent and commission expense is incurred by the Company the agent debit balance is reduced. The portion of commission expense incurred related to non-level commissions is deferred and recorded as Deferred acquisition cost. The portion of level commission is recognized as an expense within Commissions, premium taxes, and non-deferred acquisition costs. 
 
 The Company continues to see positive signs in its core operations, including sales and premium growth, and a consistent operating ROE, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, generally in the mid-teens.

 Management's Discussion Analysis 

 Globe Life's operations on a segment-by-segment basis are discussed in depth below. Net operating income has been used consistently by management for many years to evaluate the operating performance of the Company and is a measure commonly used in the life insurance industry. It differs from GAAP net income primarily because it excludes certain non-operating items such as realized gains and losses and other significant and unusual items included in net income. Management believes an analysis of net operating income is important in understanding the profitability and operating trends of the Company s business. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

 The life insurance segment is our primary segment and is the largest contributor to earnings in each period presented. The life insurance segment underwriting margin increased 129 million compared with the prior period, primarily a result of increased premiums and favorable policy obligations as a percent of premium due most notably to a remeasurement gain related to the updating of assumptions in the third quarter. Excess investment income increased 32 million compared with the prior period, resulting from growth in our invested assets and increased yields due to higher interest rates. The health segment increased slightly with 281 million of underwriting margin in the first nine months of 2024 compared with 280 million in the first nine months of 2023.

 Insurance administrative expenses increased 12 in 2024 when compared with the prior-year period. These expenses were 7.2 as a percent of premium during 2024 compared to 6.7 in 2023. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 9.7 million Globe Life Inc. shares at a total cost of 910 million for an average share price of 93.36.

 GLOBE LIFE INC. 
 Management's Discussion Analysis 

 The discussions of our segments are presented in the manner we view our operations, as described in Note 12 Business Segments . 
 
 We use three measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term: annualized premium in force, net sales, and first-year collected premium. 
 Annualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelve-month period. 
 Net sales is calculated as annualized premium issued, net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue, except in the case of Direct to Consumer, where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium is paid after any introductory offer period (typically 1 month) has expired. Management considers net sales to be a better indicator of the rate of premium growth than annualized premium issued since annualized premium issued excludes cancellations, and cancellations do not contribute to premium income. 
 First-year collected premium is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year. First-year collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur, and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium income in the future. First-year collected premiums are lower than net sales over the prior 12 months because premiums are not collected on lapsed policies after the date of lapse. 
 
 Cancellations are not included in lapses. 
 
 Approximately 90 of our premiums are collected monthly; however, other premium payment options such as quarterly and annual are offered by the Company and may be elected by the policyholder. The majority of premiums are paid by way of automatic draft or electronic payment from our policyholders and to a lesser extent from other payment methods such as check, credit card, and worksite payroll deduction.

 LIFE INSURANCE 
 
 Life insurance is the Company's predominant segment. During 2024, life premium represented 70 of total premium and life underwriting margin represented 78 of the total underwriting margin. Additionally, investments supporting the reserves for life products produce the majority of excess investment income attributable to the investment segment. 

The following table presents the summary of results of life insurance. Further discussion of the results by distribution channel is included below.

 Net policy obligations amounted to 36 of premium for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 41 in the year-ago period. This improvement was primarily due to the assumptions review of lapses, mortality, and morbidity resulting in a remeasurement gain of 56.8 million compared to a remeasurement loss of 2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 Globe Life Inc. 
 Management's Discussion Analysis 

A discussion of life operations by distribution channel follows. 
 
 The American Income Life Division markets to members of labor unions and other affinity groups and continues to diversify its lead sources, utilizing third-party internet vendor leads and obtaining referrals to facilitate sustainable growth. This Division is Globe Life's largest contributor of life premium of any distribution channel at 52 of the Company's September 30, 2024 total life premium. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the average monthly life premium issued per policy was 56 as compared to 53 for the same period in the prior year. Net sales were 289 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, up from 246 million in the year-ago period. The underwriting margin, as a percent of premium, was 47 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 up from 45 in the year ago period. 
 
 Below is the average producing agent count for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 for the American Income Life Division. The average producing agent count is based on the actual count at the beginning and end of each week during the year. The average producing agent count increased 12 over the year-ago period, and over 65 of the Division's net sales are driven by agents that have been producing for the Division for 6 months or more. The increase in average producing agent count was driven by an increase in new agent recruiting along with continued improvement in new agent retention. Sales growth in this Division, as well as within our other exclusive agencies, is generally dependent on growth in the size of the agency force. 
 At September 30, 
 Change 2024 2023 Amount American Income 
 11,680 10,395 1,285 12 
 
 American Income Life continues to focus on growing and strengthening the agency force, specifically through emphasis on agency middle-management growth and additional agency office openings. In addition to offering financial incentives and training opportunities, the Division has made considerable investments in information technology, including a customer relationship management (CRM) tool for the agency force. This tool is designed to drive productivity in lead distribution, conservation of business, manager dashboards and new agent recruiting. Additionally, this Division has invested in and successfully implemented technology that allows the agency force to engage in virtual recruiting, training, and sales activity. The agents have shifted to primarily a virtual experience with the customers and have generated a vast majority of sales through virtual presentations. We find this flexibility to be enticing for new recruits as well as a driver of sustainability for our agency force. 
 
 The Direct to Consumer Division (DTC) offers adult and juvenile life insurance through a variety of marketing approaches, including direct mailings, insert media, and electronic media. In recent years, production from electronic media, which is comprised of sales through both the internet and inbound phone calls to our call center, continue to be the customer preference when compared to direct mail. The proportion of sales from the internet and inbound phone calls continue to outpace the activity from the direct mailings, but all three channels continue to work in an omnichannel approach. The different media channels support and complement one another in the Division's efforts to reach the consumer. Additionally, this channel provides critical support to our agency business through brand impressions and the generation of sales leads. DTC's long-term growth has been fueled by constant innovation and name recognition. We continually introduce new initiatives in this Division in an attempt to increase response rates and create a seamless customer experience. 
 
 The juvenile market is an important source of sales, it is also a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of juvenile policyholders, who are more likely to respond favorably to a DTC solicitation for life coverage on themselves in comparison to the general adult population. Also, future offerings to juvenile policyholders and their parents are sources of lower acquisition-cost life insurance sales in the future. 
 
 DTC net sales declined 8 to 83 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 91 million for the same period in the prior year. This decline is due primarily to the management of direct mail and mailing insert marketing activity resulting from the impact of inflation on postage, paper and online advertising costs. While total sales have declined, the focus has been on improving profitability and improving the underwriting margin. DTC s underwriting margin, as a percent of premium, was 28 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 24 for the same period in 2023.

 Management's Discussion Analysis 

The Liberty National Division markets individual life insurance to middle-income household and worksite customers. Recent investments in new sales technologies as well as recent growth in middle management within the agency are expected to help continue this growth. The underwriting margin as a percent of premium was 38 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, up from 32 during the same period a year ago. The increase is primarily attributable to increased premiums and lower policy obligations as a percent of premium during the first nine months of 2024 as compared to same period in 2023 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the average monthly life premium per policy issued was 43 down slightly from the prior year period. 
 
 Net sales rose 4 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 over the same period in 2023 due primarily to increased agent count. 
 
 Below is the average producing agent count for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 for the Liberty National Division. The average producing agent count is based on the actual count at the beginning and end of each week during the year.

 Change 2024 2023 Amount Liberty National 
 3,638 3,177 461 15 
 
 The Liberty National Division average producing agent count increased significantly compared with the prior-year comparable period. We continue to execute our long-term plan to grow this agency through expansion from small-town markets in the Southeast to more densely populated areas with larger pools of potential agent recruits and customers. Continued expansion of this agency's presence into more heavily populated, less-penetrated areas will help create long-term agency growth. In addition to the aforementioned geographic expansion, we have also started a campaign of market expansion to increase our agency presence in cities where we currently have offices, but not enough to properly serve the community, region, area and city. These tend to be larger geographic cities which will help create long-term sustainable agency growth. Additionally, the agency continues to help improve the ability of agents to develop new worksite marketing business. Systems that have been put in place, including the addition of a CRM platform and enhanced analytical capabilities, have helped the agents develop additional worksite marketing opportunities as well as improve the productivity of agents selling in the individual life market. As the Division continues to gain momentum in its sales and recruiting initiatives, as well as advances in its technology and CRM platform, the agency anticipates continued growth i n r ecruiting activity and average producing agent count and projects sales growth for the full year. 
 
 The Other agency distribution channels primarily include non-exclusive independent agencies selling primarily life insurance. The other distribution channels contributed 153 million of life premium income, or 6 of Globe Life's total life premium income in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and contributed 2 of net sales for the period. 

HEALTH INSURANCE 
 
 Health insurance sold by the Company primarily includes Medicare Supplement insurance including Retiree Health Insurance business, accident coverage, and other limited-benefit supplemental health products including accident, cancer, critical illness, heart, and intensive care products. 
 
 Health premium accounted for 30 of our total premium in 2024, while the health underwriting margin accounted for 22 of total underwriting margin. Health underwriting margin increased slightly to 281 million compared to 280 million in the prior year. While the Company continues to emphasize life insurance sales relative to health due to life s superior long-term profitability and its greater contribution to excess investment income, the health business provides a significant contribution to return on equity as it does not require a substantial amount of up-front capital.

A discussion of health operations by distribution channel follows. 
 The United American Division consists of non-exclusive independent agencies who may also sell for other companies. The United American Division was Globe Life's largest health agency in terms of health premium income, with net sales up 14 from the same period in the prior year. 
 This Division includes three different units: 
 
 UA General Agency, which primarily sells individual Medicare Supplement insurance through independent agents; 
 Special Markets, which markets retiree health insurance to employer and union groups through brokers; and 
 Globe Life Group Benefits, which offers group worksite supplemental health insurance through brokers. 
 
 The majority of the premium revenue comes from Medicare Supplement. Underwriting margin as a percent of premium for the Division was 10 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 11 for the same period in 2023. 
 
 The Family Heritage Division primarily markets limited-benefit supplemental health insurance in non-urban areas. Most of its policies include a cash-back feature, such as a return of premium, where any excess of premiums over claims paid is returned to the policyholder at the end of a specified period stated within the insurance policy. Underwriting margin as a percent of premium was 34 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 The Division experienced a 11 rise in health net sales as compared with the nine-month period a year ago, primarily due to improved agent productivity and training. The Division will continue to implement incentive and retention programs to further these increases in the number of producing agents.

 Management's Discussion Analysis 

Below is the average producing agent count at the end of the period for the Family Heritage Division. The average producing agent count is based on the actual count at the beginning and end of each week during the year. The average producing agent count was slightly higher than compared with the same period a year ago. The Division has recently increased efforts to grow agent count and middle management. While growth in net sales and earned premium is impacted by agent productivity, growth in the number of average producing agents is what will ultimately be the primary driver of future growth in sales, similar to our other exclusive agencies.

 The Liberty National Division represented 14 of all Globe Life health premium income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Liberty National Division markets limited-benefit supplemental health products, consisting primarily of cancer and critical illness insurance. Much of Liberty National's health business is generated through worksite marketing targeting small businesses. Health premium at the Liberty National Division was 143 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 up from 141 million for the same period in 2023. Liberty National's first-year collected premium rose 13 to 21 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 19 million for the same period in 2023. Health net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 rose 1 from the comparable period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, underwriting margin as a percent of premium was 56 . 
 
 While both the American Income Life Division and the Direct to Consumer Division sell life insurance, they also market health products. The American Income Life Division primarily markets accident plans. The Direct to Consumer Division primarily markets Medicare Supplements to employer or union-sponsored groups. On a combined basis, these other channels accounted for 14 of health premium for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

ANNUITIES 
 
 Annuities represent an insignificant part of our business. We do not currently market stand-alone fixed or deferred annuity products, favoring instead protection-oriented life and supplemental health insurance products. 

INVESTMENTS 
 
 We manage our capital resources, including investments and cash flow, through the investment segment. Excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations and is the measure that we use to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in Note 12 Business Segments . It is defined as net investment income less the required interest attributable to policy liabilities. 
 
 Management also views excess investment income per diluted common share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment. It is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding, representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the Company. As excess investment income per diluted common share incorporates all invested assets and insurance liabilities, we view excess investment income per diluted common share as a useful measure to evaluate the investment segment.

Excess investment income per diluted common share generally increases at a faster pace than excess investment income because the number of diluted shares outstanding generally decreases from year to year as a result of our share repurchase program. 

Net investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 853 million or 9 greater than the year-ago period. Mean invested assets increased 5 during the first nine months of 2024 over the same period last year. Investment income grew in the current period primarily due to the growth in invested assets and higher interest rates compared to the prior year. The effective annual yield rate earned on the fixed maturity portfolio was 5.26 in the first nine months of 2024, compared with 5.18 a year earlier. In addition to fixed maturities, the Company has also invested in commercial mortgage loans and limited partnerships with debt-like characteristics that diversify risk and enhance risk-adjusted, capital-adjusted returns on the portfolio. The earned yield on the Company's commercial mortgage loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 8.47 . The earned yield on limited partnership investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 8.64 . See additional information in Note 4 Investments . 
 
 Globe Life's net investment income benefits from higher interest rates on new investments. While increasing interest rates have resulted in a net unrealized loss from our available for sale debt securities included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of September 30, 2024, we are not concerned because we do not generally intend to sell, nor is it likely that we will be required to sell, the fixed maturities prior to their anticipated recovery. 

Required interest on insurance policy liabilities reduces excess investment income, as it is the amount of net investment income considered by management necessary to fund required interest on insurance policy liabilities. As such, it is reclassified from the insurance segment to the investment segment. As discussed in Note 12 Business Segments , management regards this as a more meaningful analysis of the investment and insurance segments. Required interest is based on the original discount rate assumptions for our insurance policies in force. 
 
 The vast majority of our life and health insurance policies are fixed interest rate protection policies, not investment products, and are accounted for under current GAAP accounting guidance for long-duration insurance products which mandate that interest rate assumptions for a particular block of business be locked in for the life of that block of business. Each calendar year, we set the original discount rate to be used to calculate the benefit reserve liability for all insurance policies issued that year. The liability reported on the balance sheet is updated in subsequent periods using current discount rates as of the end of the relevant reporting period with a corresponding adjustment to Other Comprehensive Income.

 Management's Discussion Analysis 

The discount rate used for policies issued in the current year has no impact on the in-force policies issued in prior years as the rates of all prior issue years are also locked in for purposes of recognizing income. As such, the overall original discount rate for the entire in-force block of 5.5 is a weighted average of the discount rates being used from all issue years. Changes in the overall weighted-average discount rate over time are caused by changes in the mix of the reserves on the entire block of in force business. Business issued in the current year has little impact on the overall weighted-average original discount rate due to the size of our in-force business. 

In comparison to the year-ago period, required interest on insurance policy liabilities increased 36 million, or 5 , to 727 million, consistent with the 5 growth in average interest-bearing insurance policy liabilities. 

Realized Gains and Losses. Our life and health insurance companies collect premium income from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits, sometimes paid for many years or even decades in the future. Since benefits are expected to be paid in future periods, premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations. For this reason, we hold a significant investment portfolio as a part of our core insurance operations. This portfolio consists primarily of high-quality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these long-term insurance product obligations. As a result, fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support these obligations. Expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations. 
 
 Despite our intent to hold fixed maturity investments for a long period of time, investments are occasionally sold, exchanged, called, or experience a credit loss event, resulting in a realized gain or loss. Gains or losses are only secondary to our core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders. In a bond exchange offer, bondholders may consent to exchange their existing bonds for another class of debt securities. The Company also has investments in certain limited partnerships, held under the fair value option, with fair value changes recognized in Realized gains (losses) in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations . 
 
 Realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations, and as a result, can have a material positive or negative impact on net income. The significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause period-to-period trends of net income that are not indicative of historical core operating results or predictive of the future trends of core operations. Accordingly, they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as we view operations. For these reasons, and in line with industry practice, we remove the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating overall insurance operating results. 
 
 The following table summarizes our tax-effected realized gains (losses) by component.

 Management's Discussion Analysis 

Investment Acquisitions . Globe Life's investment policy calls for investing primarily in investment grade fixed maturities that meet our quality and yield objectives. We generally invest in securities with longer-term maturities because they more closely match the long-term nature of our life and health policy liabilities. We believe this strategy is appropriate since our expected future cash flows are generally stable and predictable and the likelihood that we will need to sell invested assets to raise cash is low. 

The following table summarizes selected information for fixed maturity investments. The effective annual yield shown is based on the acquisition price and call features, if any, of the securities. For non-callable bonds, the yield is calculated to maturity date. For callable bonds acquired at a premium, the yield is calculated to the earliest known call date and call price after acquisition ("first call date"). For all other callable bonds, the yield is calculated to maturity date.

 (1) Fixed maturity acquisitions included unsettled trades of 4 million in 2024 and 20 million in 2023. 
 (2) Tax-equivalent basis, where the yield on tax-exempt securities is adjusted to produce a yield equivalent to the pretax yield on taxable securities. 
 
 For investments in callable bonds, the actual life of the investment will depend on whether the issuer calls the investment prior to the maturity date. Given our investments in callable bonds, the actual average life of our investments cannot be known at the time of the investment. Absent sales and "make-whole calls," however, the average life will not be less than the average life to next call and will not exceed the average life to maturity. Data for both of these average life measures is provided in the above chart. 
 
 Acquisitions in 2023 and 2024 consisted primarily of corporate and municipal bonds with securities spanning a diversified range of issuers, industry sectors, and geographical regions. In the first nine months of 2024, we invested primarily in the industrial, financial, and utility sectors. For the entire portfolio, the taxable equivalent effective yield earned was 5.26 , up approximately 8 basis points from the yield in the first nine months of 2023. The increase in taxable equivalent effective yield was primarily due to new purchases at yields exceeding the yield on dispositions and the average portfolio yield. Our investment in fixed maturity securities was lower this quarter as we also invested in other investment opportunities. For the remainder of 2024, the Company will continue to execute on its existing strategy by seeking to invest in assets that satisfy our quality and other objectives, while maximizing the highest risk-adjusted, capital-adjusted return.

 (2) Globe Life calculates the average life and duration of the fixed maturity portfolio two ways: 
 (a) based on the next call date which is the next call date for callable bonds and the maturity date for noncallable bonds, and 
 (b) based on the maturity date of all bonds, whether callable or not. 
 (3) Effective duration is a measure of the price sensitivity of a fixed-income security to a 1 change in interest rates.

 Management's Discussion Analysis 

Corporate securities, which consist of bonds and redeemable preferred stocks, were the largest component of the fixed maturity portfolio as of September 30, 2024, representing 80 of amortized cost, net, and 81 of fair value. The remainder of the portfolio is invested primarily in securities issued by the U.S. government and U.S. municipalities. The Company holds insignificant amounts in foreign government bonds, collateralized debt obligations, asset-backed securities, and mortgage-backed securities. Corporate securities are diversified over a variety of industry sectors and issuers. At September 30, 2024, the total fixed maturity portfolio consisted of 975 issuers. 
 
 Fixed maturities had a fair value of 18.3 billion at September 30, 2024, compared with 17.9 billion at December 31, 2023. The net unrealized loss position in the fixed-maturity portfolio decreased from 1.0 billion at December 31, 2023 to 743 million at September 30, 2024 due to an increase in market rates during the period. 
 
 For more information about our fixed maturity portfolio by component at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, including a discussion of allowance for credit losses, an analysis of unrealized investment losses, and a schedule of maturities, see Note 4 Investments . 

An analysis of the fixed maturity portfolio by composite quality rating at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, is shown in the following tables. The composite rating for each security, other than private-placement securities managed by third parties, is the average of the security s available ratings as assigned by Moody s Investor Service, Standard Poor s, Fitch Ratings, and Dominion Bond Rating Service, LTD. The ratings assigned by these four nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are evenly weighted when calculating the average. The composite quality rating is created utilizing a methodology developed by Globe Life using ratings from the various rating agencies noted above. The composite quality rating is not a Standard Poor's credit rating. Standard Poor's does not sponsor, endorse, or promote the composite quality rating and shall not be liable for any use of the composite quality rating. Included in the following chart are private placement fixed maturity holdings at amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses, of 409 million 377 million at fair value) for which the ratings were assigned by the third-party managers.

 The overall quality rating of the portfolio is A-, the same as of year-end 2023. Fixed maturities rated BBB are 46 of the total portfolio at September 30, 2024, down from 48 at December 31, 2023. While this ratio is high relative to our peers, it is at its lowest level since 2007 and we have limited exposure to higher-risk assets such as derivatives, equities, and asset-backed securities. Additionally, the Company does not participate in securities lending and has no off-balance sheet investments as of September 30, 2024. Of our fixed maturity purchases, BBB securities generally provide the Company with the best risk-adjusted, capital-adjusted returns largely due to our ability to hold securities to maturity regardless of fluctuations in interest rates or equity markets. 

An analysis of changes in our portfolio of below-investment grade fixed maturities at amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses is as follows:

downgrades of existing holdings. Below-investment grade bonds at amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses, were 8 of our shareholders equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income as of September 30, 2024. Globe Life invests long term and as such, one of our key criterion in our investment process is to select issuers that are anticipated to weather multiple financial cycles. 

OPERATING EXPENSES 
 
 Operating expenses are included in the "Corporate and Other" segment and are classified into two categories: insurance administrative expenses and expenses of the Parent Company. Insurance administrative expenses generally include expenses incurred after a policy has been issued. As these expenses relate to premium for a given period, management measures the expenses as a percentage of premium income. The Company also views stock-based compensation expense as a Parent Company expense. Expenses associated with the issuance of our insurance policies are reflected as acquisition expenses and included in the determination of underwriting margin.

Total operating expenses for September 30, 2024 increased in comparison with the prior year primarily due to increases in insurance administrative expenses as well as stock compensation and legal costs and proceedings. Insurance administrative expenses increased 27.1 million primarily due to higher information technology costs, legal costs and employee costs, which includes salaries and other. Insurance administrative expenses as a percent of premium were 7.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 6.7 for the same period in 2023.

SHARE REPURCHASES 
 
 Globe Life has an ongoing share repurchase program that began in 1986. The share repurchase program is reviewed with the Board of Directors by management quarterly, and continues indefinitely unless and until the Board of Directors decides to suspend, terminate or modify the program. Management generally determines the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the excess cash flows and other available sources after the payment of dividends to the Parent Company shareholders, general market conditions, and other alternative uses. Since implementing our share repurchase program in 1986, we have used 10.3 billion to repurchase Globe Life Inc. common shares after determining that the repurchases provide a greater risk-adjusted after-tax return than other investment alternatives. 
 
 Excess cash flow at the Parent Company is primarily comprised of dividends received from the insurance subsidiaries less interest expense paid on its debt and other limited operating activities. Additionally, when stock options are exercised, proceeds from these exercises and the resulting tax benefit are used to repurchase additional shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises. 

The following chart summarizes share repurchases for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 The amount of share repurchases in the third quarter were higher as we accelerated repurchases given favorable market conditions and the use of additional capital raised during the quarter. Refer to Note 11 Debt for further details. Throughout the remainder of this discussion, share repurchases will only refer to those made from excess cash flow at the Parent Company. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 
 Liquidity. Liquidity provides Globe Life with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required to support our business operations and meet our financial obligations. Our liquidity is primarily derived from multiple sources: positive cash flow from operations, a portfolio of marketable securities, a revolving credit facility, commercial paper, and advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank. 
 
 Insurance Subsidiary Liquidity . The operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated substantial cash inflows in excess of immediate cash needs. Cash inflows for the insurance subsidiaries primarily include premium and investment income. In addition to investment income, maturities and scheduled repayments in the investment portfolio are cash inflows. Cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments, commissions, administrative expenses, and taxes. A portion of the excess cash inflows in the current year will provide for the payment of future policy benefits and are invested primarily in long-term fixed maturities as they better match the long-term nature of these obligations. Excess cash available from the insurance subsidiaries operations is generally distributed as a dividend to the Parent Company, subject to regulatory restrictions. The dividends are generally paid in amounts equal to the subsidiaries prior year statutory net income excluding realized capital gains. While the leading source of the excess cash is investment income, a significant portion of the excess cash also comes from underwriting income due to our high underwriting margins and effective expense control.

 Globe Life Inc. 
 Management's Discussion Analysis 

While the insurance subsidiaries annually generate more operating cash inflows than cash outflows, the companies also have the entire available-for-sale fixed maturity investment portfolio available to create additional cash flows if required. 
 
 Four of our insurance subsidiaries are members of the FHLB of Dallas. FHLB membership provides the insurance subsidiaries with access to various low-cost collateralized borrowings and funding agreements. While not the only source of liquidity, the FHLB could provide the insurance subsidiaries with an additional source of liquidity, if needed. Refer to Note 11 Debt for further details. 

Parent Company Liquidity. An important source of Parent Company liquidity is the dividends from its insurance subsidiaries. These dividends are received throughout the year and are used by the Parent Company to pay dividends on common and preferred stock, interest and principal repayment requirements on Parent Company debt, and operating expenses of the Parent Company. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2024 2023 Projected 2024 2023 Liquidity Sources: Dividends from Subsidiaries 451,416 411,661 480,000 520,000 
 459,535 Excess Cash Flows (1) 
 412,626 387,879 430,000 470,000 
 416,081 
 (1) Excess cash flows are reported gross of shareholder dividends. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, shareholder dividends were 65 million and 63 million, respectively. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, we project approximately 86 million in shareholder dividends, compared to the 84 million paid in 2023. 
 
 Dividends from subsidiaries and excess cash flows are projected to be higher in 2024 than in 2023 primarily due to lower life obligations and the growth in our underwriting margins in 2023, both of which resulted in higher statutory earnings generated by the affiliates. Additional sources of liquidity for the Parent Company are cash, intercompany receivables, intercompany borrowings, debt markets, term loans, and a revolving credit facility. 

Short-Term Borrowings. An additional source of Parent Company liquidity is a credit facility with a group of lenders. The facility was amended on March 29, 2024, resulting in an increased capacity of 250 million. The facility allows for unsecured borrowings and stand-by letters of credit up to 1 billion, which could be increased up to 1.25 billion. While the Parent Company may request the increase, it is not guaranteed. The updated five-year credit agreement will mature on March 29, 2029. Up to 250 million in letters of credit can be issued against the facility. The facility serves as a back-up line of credit for a commercial paper program under which commercial paper may be issued at any time, with total commercial paper outstanding not to exceed the facility maximum, less any letters of credit issued. Interest charged on the commercial paper program resembles variable rate debt due to its short term nature. As of September 30, 2024, we had available 458 million of additional borrowing capacity under this facility, compared to 384 million a year earlier. As of September 30, 2024, the Parent Company was in full compliance with all covenants related to the aforementioned debt. 
 
 As a part of the credit facility, Globe Life has stand-by letters of credits. These letters of credit are issued on behalf of our insurance subsidiaries.

The following tables present certain information about our commercial paper borrowings.

 The Company increased the commercial paper borrowings by 108 million since year-end. The Company was able to issue commercial paper as needed under this facility during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Globe Life expects to have readily available funds for 2024 and the foreseeable future to conduct its operations and to maintain target capital ratios in the insurance subsidiaries through liquid assets currently available, internally-generated cash flow and the credit facility. In the event that more liquidity is needed, the Parent Company could generate additional funds through multiple sources including, but not limited to, the issuance of debt, an additional short-term credit facility or term loan, and intercompany borrowing. 

Consolidated Liquidity. Consolidated net cash inflows from operations were 1.07 billion in the first nine months of 2024, compared with 1.09 billion in the same period of 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to fluctuations in the settlement of certain amounts included in other liabilities. In addition to cash inflows from operations, our insurance companies received proceeds from dispositions of fixed maturities available for sale, mortgage loans, and other long-term investments in the amount of 895 million during the first nine months of 2024. The Company sold shorter term securities and reinvested in longer term securities, extending duration and taking advantage of higher current interest rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As previously noted under the caption Short-Term Borrowings , the Parent Company has in place a revolving credit facility. The insurance companies have no additional outstanding credit facilities. 
 
 Cash and short-term investments were 235 million at September 30, 2024, compared with 185 million at December 31, 2023. In addition to these liquid assets, 18.3 billion (fair value at September 30, 2024) of fixed income securities are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need. Approximately 1.4 billion, at fair value, are pledged for outstanding FHLB advances and reinsurance. Further, approximately 97 of our fixed income securities are publicly traded, freely tradable under SEC Rule 144, or qualified for resale under SEC Rule 144A. While our fixed income securities are classified as available for sale, we have the ability and general intent to hold any securities to recovery or maturity. Our strong cash flows from operations, on-going investment maturities, and available liquidity under our credit facility make any need to sell securities for liquidity highly unlikely.

Capital Resources. The Parent Company's capital structure consists of short-term debt (the commercial paper facility and current maturities of long-term debt) , long-term debt, and shareholders equity. It does not include short-term FHLB borrowings, which are obligations of the insurance subsidiaries and typically repaid over the course of the year. 

Long-Term Borrowings . The outstanding long-term debt at book value was 2.3 billion at September 30, 2024 and 1.6 billion at December 31, 2023.

 On August 23, 2024, Globe Life completed the issuance of 450 million principal amount of 5.85 Senior notes due September 15, 2034. Total proceeds received by the Parent from the issuance, net of the underwriters discount, were 445 million. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, which included open market purchases of shares of its common stock under its share repurchase program.

Financing costs for the corporate and other segment consist primarily of interest on our various debt instruments. The table below presents the components of financing costs and reconciles interest expense per the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations . 

Analysis of Financing Costs 
 (Dollar amounts in thousands) Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase (Decrease) 2024 2023 Amount Interest on funded debt 53,633 55,732 (2,099) (4) Interest on term loans 9,646 4,605 5,041 109 Interest on short-term debt 28,115 16,284 11,831 73 Other 19 19 Financing costs 
 91,413 76,640 14,773 19 
 
 During the first nine months of 2024, financing costs increased 19 compared with the prior year. The increase in financing costs is primarily due to higher average balances in the current year compared to the prior year. We increased the durations on commercial paper issuances during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 due to market considerations. More information on our debt transactions is disclosed in the Financial Condition section of this report. 

Subsidiary Capital : The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has established a risk-based factor approach for determining threshold risk-based capital levels for all insurance companies. This approach was designed to assist the regulatory bodies in identifying companies that may require regulatory attention. A Risk-Based Capital (RBC) ratio is typically determined by dividing adjusted total statutory capital by the amount of risk-based capital determined using the NAIC s factors. If a company s RBC ratio approaches two times the RBC amount, the company must file a plan with the NAIC for improving its capital levels (this level is commonly referred to as Company Action Level RBC). Companies typically hold a multiple of the Company Action Level RBC depending on their particular business needs and risk profile. 
 
 Our goal is to maintain statutory capital within our insurance subsidiaries at levels necessary to support our current ratings. For 2024, Globe Life has targeted a consolidated Company Action Level RBC ratio of 300 to 320 . The Company has concluded that this capital level is more than adequate and sufficient to support its current ratings, given the nature of its business and its risk profile. The Parent Company is committed to maintaining the targeted consolidated RBC ratio at its insurance subsidiaries and has sufficient liquidity available to provide additional capital if necessary. 

Shareholders' Equity : Shareholders equity was 4.6 billion at September 30, 2024. This compares with 4.5 billion at December 31, 2023 and 4.6 billion at September 30, 2023. During the nine months since December 31, 2023, shareholders equity increased as a result of net income of 816 million during the first nine months of 2024, but was offset by share repurchases of 910 million and an additional 31 million in share repurchases to offset the dilution from stock option exercises. Additionally, the balance of AOCI increased 288 million primarily due to increased interest rates and discount rates over the period. 
 
 On August 8, 2024, the Parent Company announced that it had declared a quarterly dividend of 0.24 per share. This dividend was paid on November 1, 2024. 
 
 We plan to use excess cash available at the Parent Company as efficiently as possible in the future. Possible uses of excess cash flow include, but are not limited to, share repurchases, acquisitions, shareholder dividend payments, investments in securities, or repayment of short-term debt. We will determine the best use of excess cash after ensuring that targeted capital levels are maintained in our insurance subsidiaries. If market conditions are favorable, we currently expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. 
 
 Future policy benefits are computed using current discount rates with the impact of changes in discount rates included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Additionally, the liability for future policy benefits is calculated

 Management's Discussion Analysis 

using net premiums rather than gross premiums. Given that gross premiums are considerably higher than net premiums for our business, as seen in Note 6 Policy Liabilities , the measurement of the liability is higher than what it would be had it been computed using gross premiums. This is an important consideration when analyzing shareholders' equity. 
 
 Globe Life is required under GAAP to revalue its available for sale fixed maturity portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period. These changes, net of their associated impact on income tax, are reflected directly in shareholders equity. Fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the period-to-period presentation of our shareholders equity, capital structure, and financial ratios. Due to the long-term nature of our fixed maturity investments and policy liabilities and the strong cash flows consistently generated by our insurance subsidiaries, we have the ability to hold our securities to maturity. As such, we do not expect to incur losses due to fluctuations in market value of fixed maturities caused by market rate changes and temporarily illiquid markets. Accordingly, our management, credit rating agencies, lenders, many industry analysts, and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of this accounting rule when analyzing our balance sheet, capital structure, and financial ratios.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 

The following is an update to the material risks previously disclosed in the Company's December 31, 2023 Form 10-K. There are no other material changes to the Company's risk factors. 
 
 Our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation or regulatory scrutiny may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operation. 
 
 Insurance companies, including our insurance subsidiaries, are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which they conduct business. The primary purpose of this supervision and regulation is the protection of policyholders, not investors. Regulatory agencies have broad administrative power over numerous aspects of our business, including premium rates for our life, Medicare Supplement and other supplement health products, as well as other terms and conditions included in the insurance policies offered by our insurance subsidiaries, marketing practices, advertising, agent licensing, independent agent practices, policy forms, capital adequacy, solvency, reserves and permitted investments. 
 
 Regulatory authorities also have the power to conduct investigations, and to bring administrative or judicial proceedings against us, which could result in suspension or revocation of our licenses, cease and desist orders, fines, civil penalties, disgorgement, criminal penalties or other disciplinary action that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operation. Press coverage and other public statements that allege wrongdoing, even if untrue, can lead to increased regulatory inquiries or investigations including any that may arise in connection with the subpoenas from U.S. Attorney s Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania seeking documents related to sales practices by certain of our independent sales agents contracted to sell American Income Life Insurance Company policies. Additionally, any violation or alleged violation of law or regulations could result in significant legal costs or in legal proceedings that may result in monetary and legal remedies being imposed against the Company, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 The insurance laws, regulations and policies currently affecting our companies may change at any time, possibly having an adverse effect on our business. Should regulatory changes occur, we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals, or fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority s interpretation of such laws and regulations. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend some or all of our business activities and/or impose substantial fines. 
 
 Actual or alleged misclassification of independent contractors at our insurance subsidiaries could result in adverse legal, tax or financial consequences. 
 
 A significant portion of our sales agents are independent contractors. Although we believe we have properly classified such individuals, a risk nevertheless exists that a court, the Internal Revenue Service or other authority will take the position that our sales agents are employees. From time-to-time, we are subject to civil litigation, including class and collective action litigation, alleging that we have improperly classified certain of our sales agents as independent contractors. In September 2024, the EEOC notified us that it had determined that all sales agents affiliated with State General Agent Simon Arias were employees, not independent contractors, of Globe Life Inc. and/or AIL. Such determination is not binding but we expect any potential civil action brought by the EEOC would include such an allegation. A future adverse judgment in connection with any such civil litigation described above could result in substantial damages. Future changes in rules, regulations or interpretations of existing rules and regulations, or significant adverse judgments in litigation, could require us to reclassify all or a portion of our agents as employees and the impact could significantly increase our operating costs and negatively impact our insurance business. 
 
 The use of third-party vendors, including independent sales agents, to support the Company's operations makes the Company susceptible to the operational risk of those third parties, which could lower revenues, increase costs, reduce profits, disrupt business, or damage the Company s reputation. 
 
 The Company utilizes third-party vendors, including independent sales agents, to provide certain business services and functions, which exposes the Company to risks outside the control of the Company. The reliance on these third-party vendors creates a number of business risks, such as the risk that the Company may not maintain service 
 91 
 GL Q3 2024 FORM 10-Q 

Table of Contents 

 quality, control or effective management of the outsourced business operations and that the Company cannot control the information systems, facilities or networks of such third-party vendors. We employ controls and procedures designed to facilitate service quality of our third party vendors; however, such controls and procedures cannot be 100 effective in all cases. The Company may be adversely affected by a third-party vendor who operates in a poorly controlled manner or fails to deliver contracted services, which could lower revenues, increase costs, reduce profits, disrupt business, or damage the Company s reputation. 
 
 Extensive federal and state laws regulate our business, imposing certain requirements that independent sales agents must follow in dealing with clients. Misconduct of our independent sales agents could result in violations of law by, or claims against, us or our subsidiaries. From time to time, we are subject to private litigation as a result of alleged misconduct by independent agents. We employ controls and procedures designed to prevent and detect agent misconduct; however, such controls and procedures cannot be 100 effective in all cases. Instances of misconduct or non-compliance or violations of laws or regulations by our independent sales agents could result in adverse findings in either examinations or litigation and subject us to sanctions, monetary liabilities, restrictions on or loss of the operation of our business or reputational harm, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Additionally, the Company is at risk of being unable to meet legal, regulatory, financial or customer obligations if the information systems, facilities or networks of a third-party vendor are disrupted, damaged or fail, whether due to physical disruptions, such as fire, natural disaster, pandemic or power outage, or due to cybersecurity incidents, ransomware or other impacts to vendors, including labor strikes, political unrest and terrorist attacks. 
 
 We have become subject to, and may in the future be subject to, short selling strategies driving down the market price of our common stock. 
 
 Short selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but may have borrowed with the intention of buying identical securities back at a later date. A short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. Because it is in the short seller s best interests for the price of the securities to decline, some short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of, opinions or characterizations regarding the relevant issuer, its business prospects and similar matters calculated to or which may create negative market momentum, which may permit them to obtain profits for themselves as a result of selling the stock short. Companies, like us, that are subject to unfavorable allegations, even if untrue, may have to expend a significant amount of resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend themselves, including in connection with securityholder litigation against Globe Life Inc. or investigations by regulators related to or prompted by such allegations. 
 
 Since April 2024, we have been and continue to be the target of several short sellers who have published reports making allegations about the Company, which resulted in a significant decline in the price of our common stock. In addition, these reports resulted in significant negative publicity against us, damaged our reputation, and exposed us to securities class action litigation. We have already expended significant resources to defend and repair our reputation. We will continue to defend against any unfounded and unsubstantiated claims about our business, our disclosures and the integrity of our financial statements, which may require us to expend significant resources. 
 
 We may be subject to additional short seller reports and activity in the future. The publication of any such commentary regarding us may bring about a temporary, or long term, decline in the market price of our common stock. No assurances can be made that similar declines in the market price of our common stock or negative publicity will not occur in the future, in connection with such commentary by short sellers or otherwise. 
 
 Damage to the brand and reputation of Globe Life or its subsidiaries could affect our ability to conduct business. 
 
 Negative publicity through traditional media, internet, social media, and other public forums, including short seller reports and allegations of independent agent misconduct could damage our brand or reputation, which could adversely impact our ability to recruit and retain agents, our ability to market our products, and the persistency of in-force policies. A reduction in the number of agents selling our products, or the rate of growth of the number of agents selling our products may have an adverse impact on product sales and profit, and such impact may be material.

Recent volatility in the trading price of our common stock has and can be expected to result in securities class action litigation. 
 
 In April 2024, the trading price of our common stock dropped following the publication of certain short seller reports. As of the date of this Report, one putative securities class action has been filed against Globe Life Inc. and we expect that other putative class action claims may be filed as well. While we intend to defend such actions vigorously, any judgment against us or any future stockholder litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
