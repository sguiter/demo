 Class A units or approximately of the outstanding interests of Silvercrest L.P.

On January 11, 2016, SLP acquired certain assets of Cappiccille Company, LLC Cappiccille ). On January 15, 2019, SLP acquired certain assets of Neosho Capital LLC Neosho ). On July 1, 2019, SLP acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Cortina Asset Management, LLC Cortina ). See Notes 3, 7 and 8 for additional information related to the acquisition, goodwill and intangible assets arising from these acquisitions. Tax Receivable Agreement In connection with the Company s initial public offering (the IPO and reorganization of SLP that were completed on June 26, 2013, Silvercrest entered into a tax receivable agreement (the TRA with the partners of SLP (the SLP Partners that requires Silvercrest to pay the SLP Partners of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax that Silvercrest actually realizes (or is deemed to realize in the case of an early termination payment by it, or a change in control) as a result of the increases in tax basis and certain other tax benefits related to entering into the TRA, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the TRA or attributable to exchanges of shares of Class B common stock for shares of Class A common stock. The payments to be made pursuant to the tax receivable agreement are a liability of Silvercrest and not Silvercrest L.P. As of September 30, 2024 , this liability is estimated to be and is included in deferred tax and other liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Silvercrest expects to benefit from the remaining of cash savings realized, if any. The TRA was effective upon the consummation of the IPO and will continue until all such tax benefits have been utilized or expired, unless Silvercrest exercises its right to terminate the TRA for an amount based on an agreed upon value of the payments remaining to be made under the agreement. The TRA will automatically terminate with respect to Silvercrest s obligations to an SLP partner if such SLP partner (i) is terminated for cause, (ii) breaches his or her non-solicitation covenants with Silvercrest or any of its subsidiaries or (iii) voluntarily resigns or retires and competes with Silvercrest or any of its subsidiaries in the 12-month period following resignation of employment or retirement, and no further payments will be made to such partner under the TRA. For purposes of the TRA, cash savings in income tax will be computed by comparing Silvercrest s actual income tax liability to the amount of such taxes that it would have been required to pay had there been no increase in its share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of SLP. 

 6 

of the tax savings, as and when realized, if any. If Silvercrest does not have taxable income, it generally will not be required to make payments under the TRA for that taxable year because no tax savings will have been actually realized. 

 In addition, the TRA provides that upon certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations, or other changes of control, Silvercrest s (or its successors obligations with respect to exchanged or acquired Silvercrest Class B units, whether exchanged or acquired before or after such transaction, would be based on certain assumptions, including that Silvercrest would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the deductions arising from the increased tax deductions and tax basis and other benefits related to entering into the TRA. Decisions made by the continuing SLP Partners in the course of running Silvercrest s business, such as with respect to mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes in control, may influence the timing and amount of payments that are received by an exchanging or selling principal under the TRA. For example, the earlier disposition of assets following an exchange or acquisition transaction will generally accelerate payments under the TRA and increase the present value of such payments, and the disposition of assets before an exchange or acquisition transaction will increase an existing owner s tax liability without giving rise to any rights of a principal to receive payments under the TRA. Were the IRS to successfully challenge the tax basis increases described above, Silvercrest would not be reimbursed for any payments previously made under the TRA. As a result, in certain circumstances, Silvercrest could make payments under the TRA in excess of its actual cash savings in income tax.

of the economic interests in SLP. Silvercrest is the sole general partner of SLP and, therefore, controls the management of SLP. As a result, Silvercrest consolidates the financial position and the results of operations of SLP and its subsidiaries, and records a non-controlling interest, as a separate component of equity on its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition for the remaining economic interests in SLP. The non-controlling interest in the income or loss of SLP is included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction or addition to net income derived from SLP.

 , unless guarantees or other funding obligations exist. The Company evaluates its equity method investments for impairment, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such investments may not be recoverable. The difference between the carrying value of the equity method investment and its estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment when the loss in value is deemed other than temporary. The Company s equity method investments approximate their fair value as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . The fair value of the equity method investments is estimated based on the Company s share of the fair value of the net assets of the equity method investee. impairment charges related to equity method investments were recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023 .

reporting unit as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . goodwill impairment charges were recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Intangible assets of the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. In connection with such review, the Company also re-evaluates the periods of amortization for these assets. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed their fair value. Identifiable finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from to . The method of amortization is based on the pattern over which the economic benefits and generally expected undiscounted cash flows of the intangible asset are consumed. Intangible assets for which no pattern can be reliably determined are amortized using the straight-line method. Intangible assets consist primarily of the contractual right to future management and advisory fees and performance fees and allocations from customer contracts or relationships.

or prior written notice and (ii) after receiving the affirmative vote of a simple majority of the investors in the private fund that are not affiliated with the Company, by the private fund on or prior written notice. The investment management agreements for the private funds may also generally be terminated effective immediately by either party where the non-terminating party (i) commits a material breach of the terms subject, in certain cases, to a cure period, (ii) is found to have committed fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct or (iii) terminates, becomes bankrupt, becomes insolvent or dissolves. Each of the Company s investment management agreements contains customary indemnification obligations from the Company to their clients. The management and advisory fees are primarily driven by the level of the Company s assets under management. The assets under management increase or decrease based on the net inflows or outflows of funds into the Company s various investment strategies and the investment performance of its clients accounts. In order to increase the Company s assets under management and expand its business, the Company must develop and market investment strategies that suit the investment needs of its target clients and provide attractive returns over the long term. The Company s ability to continue to attract clients will depend on a variety of factors including, among others: the ability to educate the Company s target clients about the Company s classic value investment strategies and provide them with exceptional client service; 

 the relative investment performance of the Company s investment strategies, as compared to competing products and market indices; 

 competitive conditions in the investment management and broader financial services sectors; 

 investor sentiment and confidence; and 

 the decision to close strategies when the Company deems it to be in the best interests of its clients. 

 The majority of management and advisory fees that the Company earns on separately managed accounts are based on the value of assets under management on the last day of each calendar quarter. Most of the management and advisory fees are billed quarterly in advance on the first day of each calendar quarter. The Company s basic annual fee schedule for management of clients assets in separately managed accounts is generally: (i) for managed equity or balanced portfolios, of the first million and on the balance, (ii) for managed fixed income only portfolios, on the first million and on the balance, (iii) for the municipal value strategy, , (iv) for Cortina equity portfolios, on the first million, on the next million and on the balance and (v) for outsourced chief investment officer portfolios, on the first million, of the next million and on the balance. The Company s fee for monitoring non-discretionary assets can range from to but can also be incorporated into an agreed-upon fixed family office service fee. The majority of the Company s clients pay a blended fee rate since they are invested in multiple strategies. Management fees earned on investment funds that the Company advises are calculated primarily based on the net assets of the funds. Some funds calculate investment fees based on the net assets of the funds as of the last business day of each calendar quarter, whereas other funds calculate investment fees based on the value of net assets on the first business day of the month. Depending on the investment fund, fees are paid either quarterly in advance or quarterly in arrears. For the Company s private fund clients, the fees range from to annually. Certain management fees earned on investment funds for which the Company performs risk management and due diligence services are based on flat fee agreements customized for each engagement.

(net of cash acquired) and (2) Class B units of SLP issued to the Principals of Neosho with a value equal to and an equal number of shares of Class B common stock of the Company, having voting rights but no economic interest. The Company determined that the acquisition-date fair value of the contingent consideration was , based on the likelihood that the financial and performance targets described in the Asset Purchase Agreement will be achieved. SAMG LLC made a payment of to the Principals of Neosho on the first anniversary of the closing date. SAMG LLC will make earnout payments to the Principals of Neosho as soon as practicable following December 31, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023, in an amount equal to the greater of (i) and (ii) the product obtained by multiplying (x) by (y) the revenue of Neosho as of such payment date less the revenue of Neosho as of the immediately preceding payment date for the prior year. Earnout payments will be paid in cash and in equity. The estimated fair value of contingent consideration is recognized at the date of acquisition and adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances until the ultimate resolution of the contingency. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration are reflected as a component of general and administrative expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The fair value of the contingent consideration was based on discounted cash flow models using projected revenue for each earnout period. The discount rate applied to the projected revenue was determined based on the weighted average cost of capital for the Company and took into account that the overall risk associated with the payments was similar to the overall risks of the Company as there is no target, floor or cap associated the contingent payments. The Company has a liability of and related to earnout payments to be made in conjunction with the Neosho Acquisition which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, for contingent consideration. The Company made contingent purchase price payments to Neosho of each during the second quarters of 2024 and 2023.

as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , representing the Company s interests in the Silvercrest Funds which have been established and managed by the Company and its affiliates. The Company s financial interest in these funds can range in amounts up to of the net assets of the funds. The Company applies the equity method to account for its interests in affiliated investment funds, despite the Company s insignificant financial interest therein, because the Company exercises significant influence over and typically serves as the general partner, managing member, or equivalent of these funds. During 2007, the Silvercrest Funds granted the unaffiliated investors in each respective fund the right, by a simple majority of the fund s unaffiliated investors, without cause, to remove the general partner or equivalent of that fund or to accelerate the liquidation date of that fund in accordance with certain procedures. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company determined that none of the Silvercrest Funds were required to be consolidated. The Company s involvement with these entities began on the dates that they were formed, which range from July 2003 to July 2014. Fair Value Measurements GAAP establishes a hierarchal disclosure framework which prioritizes and ranks the level of market price observability used in measuring investments at fair value. Market price observability is affected by a number of factors, including the type of investment, the characteristics specific to the investment and the state of the marketplace including the existence and transparency of transactions between market participants. Investments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices in an orderly market generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment used in measuring fair value. Level I: Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical investments as of the reporting date. The type of investments in Level I include listed equities and listed derivatives. 

 Level II: Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date, and fair value is determined through the use of models or other valuation methodologies. Investments which are generally included in Level II include corporate bonds and loans, less liquid and restricted equity securities, certain over-the counter derivatives, and certain fund of hedge funds investments in which the Company has the ability to redeem its investment at net asset value at, or within three months of, the reporting date. 

 Level III: Pricing inputs are unobservable for the investment and includes situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the investment. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. Investments that are included in Level III generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity and real estate funds, credit-oriented funds, certain over-the-counter derivatives, funds of hedge funds which use net asset value per share to determine fair value in which the Company may not have the ability to redeem its investment at net asset value at, or within three months of, the reporting date, distressed debt and non-investment grade residual interests in securitizations and collateralized debt obligations. Liabilities that are included in Level III generally include contingent consideration related to the acquisition earnouts. 

 In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the determination of which category within the fair value hierarchy is appropriate for any given investment is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the investment. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company did t have any financial assets or liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, with the exception of the contingent consideration related to the acquisition earnouts. Contingent Consideration For business acquisitions, the Company recognizes the fair value of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets, and estimated contingent consideration at the acquisition date as part of purchase price. This fair value measurement is based on unobservable (Level 3) inputs.

Estimated contingent consideration is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Payments of contingent consideration are included in earnouts paid related to acquisitions in financing activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In determining fair value of the estimated contingent consideration, the acquired business future performance is estimated using financial projections for the acquired business. These financial projections, as well as alternative scenarios of financial performance, are measured against the performance targets specified in each respective acquisition agreement. In addition, discount rates are established based on the cost of debt and the cost of equity. The Company uses the Monte Carlo Simulation Model to determine the fair value of the Company s estimated contingent consideration. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s estimated contingent consideration are the forecasted growth rates over the measurement period and discount rates. Significant increases or decreases in the Company s forecasted growth rates over the measurement period or discount rates would result in a higher or lower fair value measurement. Please refer to Note 3. Acquisitions for more details on contingent consideration related to acquisition earnouts.

(1) EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure of earnings, represents net income before provision for income taxes, interest income, interest expense, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA without giving effect to items including, but not limited to, professional fees associated with acquisitions or financing transactions, gains on extinguishment of debt or other obligations related to acquisitions, losses on disposals or abandonment of assets and leaseholds, severance and other similar expenses, but including partner incentive allocations, prior to our initial public offering, as an expense. We use this non-GAAP financial measure to assess the strength of our business. These adjustments and the non-GAAP financial measures that are derived from them provide supplemental information to analyze our business from period to period. Investors should consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures in accordance with GAAP. See Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Information for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. 

(2) Adjusted EBITDA margin, a non-GAAP measure of earnings, is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total revenue. 

(3) We have computed average assets under management by averaging assets under management at the beginning of the applicable period and assets under management at the end of the applicable period. 

Revenue 
 We generate revenue from management and advisory fees, performance fees and allocations, and family office services fees. Our management and advisory fees are generated by managing assets on behalf of separate accounts and acting as investment adviser for various investment funds. Our performance fees and allocations relate to assets managed in external investment strategies in which we have a revenue sharing arrangement and in funds in which we have no partnership interest. Our management and advisory fees and family office services fees income is recognized through the course of the period in which these services are provided. Income from performance fees and allocations is recorded at the conclusion of the contractual performance period when all contingencies are 
 30 

resolved. In certain arrangements, we are only entitled to receive performance fees and allocations when the return on assets under management exceeds certain benchmark returns or other performance targets. 
 The discretionary investment management agreements for our separately managed accounts do not have a specified term. Rather, each agreement may be terminated by either party at any time, unless otherwise agreed with the client, upon written notice of termination to the other party. The investment management agreements for our private funds are generally in effect from year to year, and may be terminated at the end of any year (or, in certain cases, on the anniversary of execution of the agreement) (i) by us upon 30 or 90 days prior written notice and (ii) after receiving the affirmative vote of a specified percentage of the investors in the private fund that are not affiliated with us, by the private fund on 60 or 90 days prior written notice. The investment management agreements for our private funds may also generally be terminated effective immediately by either party where the non-terminating party (i) commits a material breach of the terms subject, in certain cases, to a cure period, (ii) is found to have committed fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct or (iii) terminates, becomes bankrupt, becomes insolvent or dissolves. Each of our investment management agreements contains customary indemnification obligations from us to our clients. The tables below set forth the amount of assets under management, the percentage of management and advisory fees revenues, the amount of revenue recognized, and the average assets under management for discretionary managed accounts and for private funds for each period presented.

Our management and advisory fees are primarily driven by the level of our assets under management. Our assets under management increase or decrease based on the net inflows or outflows of funds into our various investment strategies and the investment performance of our clients accounts. In order to increase our assets under management and expand our business, we must develop and market investment strategies that suit the investment needs of our target clients and provide attractive returns over the long term. Our ability to continue to attract clients will depend on a variety of factors including, among others: 
 our ability to educate our target clients about our classic value investment strategies and provide them with exceptional client service; 

the relative investment performance of our investment strategies, as compared to competing products and market indices; 

competitive conditions in the investment management and broader financial services sectors; 

investor sentiment and confidence; and 

our decision to close strategies when we deem it to be in the best interests of our clients. 

31 

The majority of management and advisory fees that we earn on separately managed accounts are based on the value of assets under management on the last day of each calendar quarter. Most of our management and advisory fees are billed quarterly in advance on the first day of each calendar quarter. Our basic annual fee schedule for management of clients assets in separately managed accounts is: (i) for managed equity or balanced portfolios, 1 of the first 10 million and 0.60 on the balance, (ii) for managed fixed income only portfolios, 0.40 on the first 10 million and 0.30 on the balance, (iii) for the municipal value strategy, 0.65 , (iv) for Cortina s equity portfolios, 1 on the first 25 million, 0.90 on the next 50 million and 0.80 on the balance and (v) for outsourced chief investment officer portfolios, 0.40 on the first 50 million, 0.32 on the next 50 million and 0.24 on the balance. Our fee for monitoring non-discretionary assets can range from 0.05 to 0.01 , but can also be incorporated into an agreed-upon fixed family office service fee. The majority of our client relationships pay a blended fee rate since they are invested in multiple strategies. 
 Management fees earned on investment funds that we advise are calculated primarily based on the net assets of the funds. Some funds calculate investment fees based on the net assets of the funds as of the last business day of each calendar quarter, whereas other funds calculate investment fees based on the value of net assets on the first business day of the month. Depending on the investment fund, fees are paid either quarterly in advance or quarterly in arrears. For our private funds, the fees range from 0.25 to 1.5 annually. Certain management fees earned on investment funds for which we perform risk management and due diligence services are based on flat fee agreements customized for each engagement. 
 Average annual management fee is calculated by dividing our actual annualized revenue earned over a period by our average assets under management during the same period (which is calculated by averaging quarter-end assets under management for the applicable period). Our average annual management fee was 0.36 and 0.38 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our average annual management fee was 0.36 and 0.39 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Changes in our total average management fee rates are typically the result of changes in the mix of our assets under management and the concentration in our equities strategies whose fee rates are higher than those of other investment strategies. Management and advisory fees are also adjusted for any cash flows into or out of a portfolio, where the cash flow represents greater than 10 of the previous quarter-end market value of the portfolio. These cash flow-related adjustments were insignificant for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Silvercrest L.P. has authority to take fees directly from external custodian accounts of its separately managed accounts. 
 Our management and advisory fees may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including the following: 
 changes in assets under management due to appreciation or depreciation of our investment portfolios, and the levels of the contribution and withdrawal of assets by new and existing clients; 

allocation of assets under management among our investment strategies, which have different fee schedules; 

allocation of assets under management between separately managed accounts and advised funds, for which we generally earn lower overall management and advisory fees; and 

the level of our performance with respect to accounts and funds on which we are paid incentive fees. 

Our family office services capabilities enable us to provide comprehensive and integrated services to our clients. Our dedicated group of tax and financial planning professionals provide financial planning, tax planning and preparation, partnership accounting and fund administration and consolidated wealth reporting among other services. Family office services income fluctuates based on both the number of clients for whom we perform these services and the level of agreed-upon fees, most of which are flat fees. Therefore, non-discretionary assets under management, which are associated with family office services, do not typically serve as the basis for the amount of family office services revenue that is recognized. 
 Expenses 
 Our expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits expenses, as well as general and administrative expense including rent, professional services fees, data-related costs and sub-advisory fees. These expenses may fluctuate due to a number of factors, including the following: 
 variations in the level of total compensation expense due to, among other things, bonuses, awards of equity to our employees and partners of Silvercrest L.P., changes in our employee count and mix, and competitive factors; and 

the level of management fees from funds that utilize sub-advisors will affect the amount of sub-advisory fees. 

Compensation and Benefits Expense 
 Our largest expense is compensation and benefits, which includes the salaries, bonuses, equity-based compensation and related benefits and payroll costs attributable to our principals and employees. Our compensation methodology is intended to meet the 
 32 

following objectives: (i) support our overall business strategy; (ii) attract, retain and motivate top-tier professionals within the investment management industry; and (iii) align our employees interests with those of our equity owners. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, a general rise in compensation and benefits expense commensurate with growth in headcount and with the need to maintain competitive compensation levels. 
 The components of our compensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 21,713 and 20,476, respectively, of partner incentive payments were included in cash compensation and benefits expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses include occupancy-related costs, professional and outside services fees, office expenses, depreciation and amortization, sub-advisory fees and the costs associated with operating and maintaining our research, trading and portfolio accounting systems. Our costs associated with operating and maintaining our research, trading and portfolio accounting systems and professional services expenses generally increase or decrease in relative proportion to the number of employees retained by us and the overall size and scale of our business operations. Sub-advisory fees will fluctuate based on the level of management fees from funds that utilize sub-advisors. 
 Other Income 
 Other income is derived primarily from investment income arising from our investments in various private investment funds that were established as part of our investment strategies. We expect the investment components of other income, in the aggregate, to fluctuate based on market conditions and the success of our investment strategies. Performance fees and allocations earned from those investment funds in which we have a partnership interest have been earned over the past few years as a result of the achievement of various high-water marks depending on the investment fund. These performance fees and allocations are recorded based on the equity method of accounting. The majority of our performance fees and allocations over the past few years have been earned from our fixed income-related funds. 
 Non-Controlling Interests 
 We are the general partner of Silvercrest L.P. and control its business and affairs and, therefore, consolidate its financial results with ours. In light of the limited partners interest in Silvercrest L.P., we reflect their partnership interests as non-controlling interests in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Provision for Income Tax 
 We are subject to taxes applicable to C-corporations. Our effective tax rate, and the absolute dollar amount of our tax expense will be offset by the benefits of the tax receivable agreement entered into with our Class B stockholders. 
 Acquisitions 
 On December 13, 2018, we executed an Asset Purchase Agreement (the Neosho Asset Purchase Agreement by and among the Company, Silvercrest L.P. SLP ), Silvercrest Asset Management Group LLC SAMG LLC and Neosho Capital LLC Neosho or the Seller ), and Christopher K. Richey, Alphonse I. Chan, Robert K. Choi and Vincent G. Pandes, each such individual a principal of Neosho, to acquire certain assets of Neosho. The transaction contemplated by the Neosho Asset Purchase Agreement closed on January 15, 2019, and is referred to herein as the Neosho Acquisition .

 Total other income (expense) net increased by 0.1 million to other income of 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from other income of 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income increased due to higher rates earned on cash in interest-bearing accounts. Interest expense decreased because of the maturity and satisfaction of our term loan under our credit facility during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the same period in the prior year. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Total other income (expense) net increased by 0.8 million to other income of 0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from other income of 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income increased due to higher rates earned on cash in interest-bearing accounts. Interest expense decreased because of lower outstanding balances on

 Provision for Income Taxes 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 The provision for income taxes was 1.1 million and 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change was primarily related to decreased profitability during the current period as compared to the prior year. Our provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 22.7 and 20.6 , respectively. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 The provision for income taxes was 3.6 million and 4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change was primarily related to decreased profitability during the current period as compared to the prior year. Our provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 21.6 and 20.6 , respectively.

Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Information 
 To provide investors with additional insight, promote transparency and allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, we supplement our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements presented on a basis consistent with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, with Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Earnings Per Share which are non-GAAP financial measures of earnings. 
 EBITDA represents net income before provision for income taxes, interest income, interest expense, depreciation and amortization. 

We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA without giving effect to the Delaware franchise tax, professional fees associated with acquisitions or financing transactions, gains on extinguishment of debt or other obligations related to acquisitions, impairment charges and losses on disposals or abandonment of assets and leaseholds, client reimbursements and fund redemption costs, severance and other similar expenses, but including partner incentive allocations, prior to our initial public offering, as an expense. We believe that it is important to management and investors to supplement our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements presented on a GAAP basis with Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure of earnings, as this measure provides a perspective of recurring earnings of the Company, taking into account earnings attributable to both Class A and Class B stockholders. 

Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total revenue. We believe that it is important to management and investors to supplement our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements presented on a GAAP basis with Adjusted EBITDA Margin, a non-GAAP financial measure of earnings, as this measure provides a perspective of recurring profitability of the Company, taking into account profitability attributable to both Class A and Class B stockholders. 

Adjusted Net Income represents recurring net income without giving effect to professional fees associated with acquisitions or financing transactions, losses on forgiveness of notes receivable from our principals, gains on extinguishment of debt or other obligations related to acquisitions, impairment charges and losses on disposals or abandonment of assets and leaseholds, client reimbursements and fund redemption costs, severance and other similar expenses, but including partner incentive allocations, prior to our initial public offering, as an expense. Furthermore, Adjusted Net Income includes income tax expense assuming a blended corporate rate of 26 . We believe that it is important to management and investors to supplement our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements presented on a GAAP basis with Adjusted Net Income, a non-GAAP financial measure of earnings, as this measure provides a perspective of recurring income of the Company, taking into account income attributable to both Class A and Class B stockholders. 

Adjusted Earnings Per Share represents Adjusted Net Income divided by the actual Class A and Class B shares outstanding as of the end of the reporting period for basic Adjusted Earnings Per Share, and to the extent dilutive, we add unvested restricted stock units and non-qualified stock options to the total shares outstanding to compute diluted Adjusted Earnings Per Share. As a result of our structure, which includes a non-controlling interest, we believe that it is important to management and investors to supplement our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements presented on a GAAP basis with Adjusted Earnings Per Share, a non-GAAP financial measure of earnings, as this measure provides a perspective of recurring earnings per share of the Company as a whole as opposed to being limited to our Class A common stock. 

These adjustments, and the non-GAAP financial measures that are derived from them, provide supplemental information to analyze our operations between periods and over time. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measure in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Historically, the working capital needs of our business have primarily been met through cash generated by our operations. We expect that our cash and liquidity requirements in the next twelve months will be met primarily through cash generated by our operations. We will continue to evaluate our liquidity and financial position on an ongoing basis. 
 On June 24, 2013, the subsidiaries of Silvercrest L.P. entered into a 15.0 million credit facility with City National Bank. The subsidiaries of Silvercrest L.P. are the borrowers under such facility and Silvercrest L.P. guarantees the obligations of its subsidiaries under the credit facility. The credit facility is secured by certain assets of Silvercrest L.P. and its subsidiaries. The credit facility consisted of a 7.5 million delayed draw term loan that was scheduled to mature on June 24, 2025, and a 7.5 million revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature on June 21, 2019. Effective July 1, 2019, the credit facility was increased and consisted of a 25.5 million delayed draw term loan that was to mature on July 1, 2026, and a 10.0 million revolving credit facility with a stated maturity date of June 18, 2024 and a stated term loan draw date of July 1, 2024. On June 17, 2022, the revolving credit facility was amended to replace LIBOR terms with its successor, SOFR. The loan bears interest at either (a) the higher of the prime rate plus a margin of 0.25 percentage points and 2.5 or (b) the SOFR rate plus 2.80 percentage points, at the borrowers option. On February 15, 2022, the credit facility was amended and restated to reflect changes to various definitions and related clauses with respect to the Company s subsidiaries. On February 15, 2022, the credit facility was amended and restated to reflect changes to various definitions and related clauses with respect to the Company s subsidiaries. The credit facility contains restrictions on, among other things, (i) incurrence of additional debt, (ii) creating liens on certain assets, (iii) making certain investments, (iv) consolidating, merging or otherwise disposing of substantially all of our assets, (v) the sale of certain assets, and (vi) entering into transactions with affiliates. In addition, the credit facility contains certain financial covenants including a test on discretionary assets under management, maximum debt to EBITDA and a fixed charge coverage ratio. The credit facility contains customary events of default, including the occurrence of a change in control which includes a person or group of persons acting together acquiring more than 30 of the total voting securities of Silvercrest. On June 18, 2024, the subsidiaries of Silvercrest L.P. and City National Bank entered into an Amendment and Restatement Agreement, which amends and restates the credit facility (as so amended and restated, the A R Credit Agreement whereby, among other items, (i) the term loan maturity date was extended until June 18, 2027, (ii) the term loan draw date was extended to June 18, 2025, (iii) the term loan commitment was decreased from 25.5 million to 10.0 million as a result of the repayment in full of the existing term loans previously borrowed under the Credit Agreement, and (iv) the 10.0 million revolving credit facility maturity date was extended until June 18, 2025. Additionally, the quarterly installments due upon termination of the term loan commitment were revised to equal 5 of the aggregate principal amount of term loans outstanding as of June 18, 2025 (after giving effect to any term loan made on such date). The fee structure was amended so as to provide for an upfront fee of 15,000 and additional commitment fee of up to 100,000 payable in three installments of 33,333.33 each, subject to the terms of the A R Credit Agreement, and the unused line fee with respect to the term loan commitment was increased to 0.75 per annum times the actual daily amount of unused term loan commitment for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter. The credit agreement and all other loan documents between the Credit Parties and City National Bank continued in full force and effect. We were in compliance with the covenants under the credit facility as of September 30, 2024.

Our ongoing sources of cash will primarily consist of management fees and family office services fees, which are principally collected quarterly. We will primarily use cash flow from operations to pay compensation and related expenses, general and administrative expenses, income taxes, debt service, capital expenditures, distributions to Class B unit holders and dividends on shares of our Class A common stock. 
 Seasonality typically affects cash flow since the first quarter of each year includes, as a source of cash, payment of the prior year s annual performance fees and allocations, if any, from our various funds and external investment strategies and, as a use of cash, the prior fiscal year s incentive compensation. We believe that we have sufficient cash from our operations to fund our operations and commitments for the next twelve months. 
 The following table sets forth certain key financial data relating to our liquidity and capital resources as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

We anticipate that distributions to the limited partners of Silvercrest L.P. will continue to be a material use of our cash resources and will vary in amount and timing based on our operating results and dividend policy. We pay and intend to continue paying quarterly cash dividends to holders of our Class A common stock. We are a holding company and have no material assets other than our ownership of interests in Silvercrest L.P. As a result, we will depend upon distributions from Silvercrest L.P. to pay any dividends to our Class A stockholders. We expect to cause Silvercrest L.P. to make distributions to us in an amount sufficient to cover dividends, if any, declared by us. Our dividend policy has certain risks and limitations, particularly with respect to liquidity. Although we expect to pay dividends according to our dividend policy, we may not pay dividends according to our policy, or at all, if, among other things, we do not have the cash necessary to pay our intended dividends or our subsidiaries are prevented from making a distribution to us under the terms of our current credit facility or any future financing. To the extent we do not have cash on hand sufficient to pay dividends, we may decide not to pay dividends. By paying cash dividends rather than investing that cash in our future growth, we risk slowing the pace of our growth, or not having a sufficient amount of cash to fund our operations or unanticipated capital expenditures, should the need arise. 
 Our purchase of Class B units in Silvercrest L.P. that occurred concurrently with the consummation of our initial public offering, and the future exchanges of Class B units of Silvercrest L.P., are expected to result in increases in our share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of Silvercrest L.P. at the time of our acquisition and these future exchanges, which will increase the tax depreciation and amortization deductions that otherwise would not have been available to us. These increases in tax basis and tax depreciation and amortization deductions are expected to reduce the amount of tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future. We entered into a tax receivable agreement with the current principals of Silvercrest L.P. and any future employee-holders of Class B units pursuant to which we agreed to pay them 85 of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax that we actually realize as a result of these increases in tax basis and certain other tax benefits related to entering into the tax receivable agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments thereunder. The timing of these payments is currently unknown. The payments to be made pursuant to the tax receivable agreement will be a liability of Silvercrest and not Silvercrest L.P., and thus this liability has been recorded as an other liability on our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition. For purposes of the tax receivable agreement, cash savings in income tax will be computed by comparing our actual income tax liability to the amount of such taxes that we would have been required to pay had there been no increase in our share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of Silvercrest L.P. 
 The actual increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the tax receivable agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of exchanges, the price of shares of our Class A common stock at the time of the exchange, the extent to which such exchanges are taxable, the amount and timing of our income and the tax rates then applicable. Nevertheless, we expect that as a result of the size of the increases in the tax basis of our tangible and intangible assets, the payments that we may make under the tax receivable agreement likely will be substantial. Assuming no material changes in the relevant tax law and that we earn sufficient taxable income to realize the full tax benefit of the increased depreciation and amortization of our assets, we expect that future payments to the selling principals of Silvercrest L.P. in respect of our purchase of Class B units from them will aggregate approximately 9.1 million. Future payments to current principals of Silvercrest L.P. and future holders of Class B units in respect of subsequent exchanges would be in addition to these amounts and are expected to be substantial. We intend to fund required payments pursuant to the tax receivable agreement from the distributions received from Silvercrest L.P.

 We anticipate that distributions to principals of Silvercrest L.P. will continue to be a material use of our cash resources, and will vary in amount and timing based on our operating results and dividend policy. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 0 and 2.7 million, respectively, was outstanding under the term loan with City National Bank. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, accrued but unpaid interest on the term loan with City National Bank was 0 and 33 thousand, respectively.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 7, 2024. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Investment advisory fees are typically billed quarterly in advance at the beginning of the quarter or in arrears after the end of the quarter, based on a contractual percentage of the assets managed. Family office services fees are also typically billed quarterly in advance at the beginning of the quarter or in arrears after the end of the quarter based on a contractual percentage of the assets managed or upon a contractually agreed-upon flat fee arrangement. Revenue is recognized on a ratable basis over the period in which services are performed. 
 We account for performance-based revenue in accordance with ASC 606-10-32, Accounting for Management Fees Based on a Formula, by recognizing performance fees and allocations as revenue only when it is certain that the fee income is earned and payable pursuant to the relevant agreements. In certain arrangements, we are only entitled to receive performance fees and allocations when the return on assets under management exceeds certain benchmark returns or other performance targets. We record performance fees and allocations as a component of revenue once the performance fee has crystallized. As a result, there is no estimate or variability in the consideration when revenue is recorded. 
 Because the majority of our revenues are earned based on assets under management that have been determined using fair value methods and since market appreciation/depreciation has a significant impact on our revenue, we have presented our assets under management using the GAAP framework for measuring fair value. That framework provides a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs based on company assumptions (Level 3). A financial instrument s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the instrument s fair value measurement. The three levels within the fair value hierarchy are described as follows: 
 Level 1 includes quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical instruments at the measurement date. The types of financial instruments included in Level 1 include unrestricted securities, including equities listed in active markets. 

Level 2 includes inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the instruments, including quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the instruments. The type of financial instruments in this category includes less liquid and restricted securities listed in active markets, securities traded in other than active markets, government and agency securities, and managed funds whose net asset value is based on observable inputs.

As substantially all our assets under management are valued by independent pricing services based upon observable market prices or inputs, we believe market risk is the most significant risk underlying valuation of our assets under management, as discussed under the heading Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and Item 3. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures Regarding Market Risk.

The average value of our assets under management for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 34.3 and 34.2 billion, respectively. Assuming a 10 increase or decrease in our average assets under management and the change being proportionately distributed over all our products, the value would increase or decrease by approximately 3.4 and 3.4 billion, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, which would cause an annualized increase or decrease in revenues of approximately 12.2 and 12.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, at a weighted average fee rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 0.36 and 0.36 , respectively. 
 The average value of our assets under management for the year ended December 31, 2023 was approximately 31.1 billion. Assuming a 10 increase or decrease in our average assets under management and the change being proportionately distributed over all our products, the value would increase or decrease by approximately 3.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, which would cause an annualized increase or decrease in revenues of approximately 11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, at a weighted average fee rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 of 0.38 . 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 Information regarding recent accounting developments and their impact on the Company can be found in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this filing. 
 
 I tem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures Regarding Market Risk 
 Our exposure to market risk is directly related to our role as investment adviser for the separate accounts we manage and the funds for which we act as sub-investment adviser. Most of our revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was derived from advisory fees, which are typically based on the market value of assets under management. Accordingly, a decline in the prices of securities would cause our revenue and income to decline due to a decrease in the value of the assets we manage. In addition, such a decline could cause our clients to withdraw their funds in favor of investments offering higher returns or lower risk, which would cause our revenue and income to decline further. Due to the nature of our business, we believe that we do not face any material risk from inflation. Please see our discussion of market risks in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Revenue Recognition which is part of Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 I tem 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) at September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at September 30, 2024. 
 Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Company management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility that misstatements may not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, even effective internal control 
 46 

over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Furthermore, the effectiveness of internal controls can change with circumstances. Company management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on the 2013 version of the Internal Control - Integrated Framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on that assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2024.
