as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act ). Forward-looking statements include information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations, business
strategies, need for financing, competitive position, and potential growth opportunities. Our forward-looking statements do not
consider the effects of future legislation or regulations. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical
facts and can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as the words believes, intends, 
 may, should, anticipates, expects, could, plans, 
 estimates, projects, targets or comparable terminology or by discussions of strategy
or trends. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot give
any assurances that these expectations will prove to be correct. Such statements by their nature involve risks and uncertainties
that could significantly affect expected results, and actual future results could differ materially from those described in such
forward-looking statements. 

Among
the factors that could cause actual future results to differ materially are the risks and uncertainties discussed in this report
and in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. While it is not possible to identify all factors,

risks associated
 with drilling, including completion risks, cost overruns and the drilling of non-economic wells or dry holes;

the presence or

risks and liabilities
 associated with acquired companies and properties; 

risks related to
 the integration of acquired companies and properties; 

potential defects
 in title to our properties; 

cost and availability
 of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel, and oilfield services; 

geological concentration
 of our reserves; 

environmental or
 other governmental regulations, including the legislation of hydraulic fracture stimulation; 

3 

our ability to secure
 firm transportation for oil and natural gas we produce and to sell the oil and natural gas at market prices; 

exploration and
 development risks; 

management s
 ability to execute our plans to meet our goals; 

our ability to retain
 key members of our management team on commercially reasonable terms; 

the occurrence of
 cybersecurity incidents, attacks or other breaches to our information technology systems or on systems and infrastructure
 used by the oil and gas industry; 

weather conditions; 

effectiveness
 of our internal control over financial reporting; 

actions
 or inactions of third-party operators of our properties; 

costs
 and liabilities associated with environmental, health and safety laws; 

our
 ability to find and retain highly skilled personnel; 

operating
 hazards attendant to the oil and natural gas business; 

competition
 in the oil and natural gas industry; 

evolving
 geopolitical and military hostilities in the Middle East; 

economic
 and competitive conditions; 

lack
 of available insurance; 

cash
 flow and anticipated liquidity; 

the
 other factors discussed under Risk Factors in our Annual Report 

Forward-looking
statements speak only as to the date hereof. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, we disclaim any intention or obligation
to update publicly or revise such statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 

There
may also be other risks and uncertainties that we are unable to predict at this time or that we do not now expect to have a material
adverse impact on our business.

Revenues 

Revenues
were 250,619 and 750,678 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 248,302 and 665,643 for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company is an early-stage company, having just begun to acquire assignments of hydrocarbon
revenues and underlying oil and gas exploration and production rights, and therefore has just begun producing significant revenue
in 2023. The increase in revenues from each period in 2023 to the same periods in 2024 was due to an increase in production and
the acquisition of oil and gas properties. 

Lease
Operating Expenses 

Lease
operating expenses were 273,801 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 158,516 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, representing an increase of 115,285 or 72.7 . Lease operating expenses were 110,318 and 40,639 for the
three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in expense was primarily attributable
to the increase in production, which is line with the change in revenue. 

22 

Loss
from Operations 

Total
operating loss was 149,185 and 526,811 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and operating profit of 13,661
and loss of 411,930 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increased loss was primarily driven by the 180,313
and 207,998 increase in total lease operating and general and administrative expenses during the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024. The increase in expenses was partially offset by the increase in revenue over the same periods. 

Other
Expense, Net 

Other
expense, net was 871 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1,621 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023; and was 573 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 521 for the three months ended September
30, 2023. These changes were primarily driven by an increase in interest income. 

Net
Loss 

As
a result of the above factors, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a net loss of 527,682, as compared
to a net loss of 413,551 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company
had a net loss of 149,758, as compared to a net profit of 13,140 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Sources
of Liquidity 

The
Company had cash on hand of 127,650 at September 30, 2024, compared to 75,908 at December 31, 2023. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, the Company had net cash provided by operating activities of 59,219, compared to net cash used of 7,898
for the same period of 2023. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was driven by the 501,998 increase in adjustments
for changes in the balances of accounts receivable, prepaid expense, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities, offset by the
 312,670 decrease in the adjustment for the noncash issuance of common stock for services and salaries. 

Net
cash used in investing activities was 0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023. 

Net
cash used in financing activities was 7,477 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash used in financing
activities of 7,404 for the same period in 2023. The increase is attributable to payments of the PPP loan. 

23 

Capital
Resources for Future Acquisition and Development Opportunities 

We
continuously evaluate potential acquisitions and development opportunities. To the extent possible, we intend to acquire producing
properties and/or developed undrilled properties rather than exploratory properties. We do not intend to limit our evaluation
to any one state. We presently have no intention to evaluate offshore properties or properties located outside of the United States. 

Effects
of Inflation and Pricing 

The
oil and natural gas industry is very cyclical and the demand for goods and services of oil field companies, suppliers, and others
associated with the industry puts pressure on the economic stability and pricing structure within the industry. Typically, as
prices for oil and natural gas increase, so do all associated costs. Material changes in prices impact the current revenue stream,
estimates of future reserves, borrowing base calculations of bank loans, and the value of properties in purchase and sale transactions.
Material changes in prices can impact the value of oil and natural gas companies and their ability to raise capital, borrow money
and retain personnel. We anticipate business costs will vary in accordance with commodity prices for oil and natural gas, and
the associated increase or decrease in demand for services related to production and exploration. 

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The
Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, and it is not anticipated that the Company will enter into any off-balance
sheet arrangements. 

Disclosures
About Market Risks 

Like
other natural resource producers, the Company faces certain unique market risks associated with the exploration and production
of oil and natural gas. The most salient risk factors are the volatile prices of oil and gas, operational risks, the ability to
integrate properties and businesses, and certain environmental concerns and obligations. 

Oil
and Gas Prices 

The
price we receive for our oil and natural gas will heavily influence our revenue, profitability, access to capital, and future
rate of growth. Oil and natural gas are commodities and, therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response
to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. The prices we receive for our production depend on numerous factors beyond our
control. These factors include, without limitation, the following: worldwide and regional economic conditions impacting the global
supply and demand for oil and natural gas; the price and quantity of imports of foreign oil and natural gas; the level of global
oil and natural gas inventories; localized supply and demand fundamentals; the availability of refining capacity; price and availability
of transportation and pipeline systems with adequate capacity; weather conditions, natural disasters, and public health threats;
governmental regulations; speculation as to the future price of oil and the speculative trading of oil and natural gas futures
contracts; price and availability of competitors supplies of oil and natural gas; energy conservation and environmental
measures; technological advances affecting energy consumption; the price and availability of alternative fuels and energy sources;
and domestic and international drilling activity. 

24 

A
substantial or extended decline in oil or natural gas prices may result in impairments of our proved oil and gas properties and
may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. 

Transportation
of Oil and Natural Gas 

The
Company is presently committed to using the services of the existing gatherers in its present areas of production. This gives
such gatherers certain short-term relative monopolistic powers to set gathering and transportation costs. Obtaining the services
of an alternative gathering company would require substantial additional costs since an alternative gatherer would be required
to lay a new pipeline and/or obtain new rights-of-way. 

Competition
in the Oil and Natural Gas Industry 

We
operate in a highly competitive environment for developing and acquiring properties, marketing oil and natural gas, and securing
equipment and trained personnel. As a relatively small oil and natural gas company, many large producers possess and employ financial,
technical, and personnel resources substantially greater than ours. Those companies may be able to develop and acquire more prospects
and productive properties than our financial or personnel resources permit. It is also significant that more favorable prices
can usually be negotiated for larger quantities of oil and/or gas products, such that the Company views itself as having a price
disadvantage compared to larger producers. 

Retention
of Key Personnel 

We
depend to a large extent on the services of our officers. These individuals have extensive experience in the energy industry,
as well as expertise in evaluating and analyzing producing oil and natural gas properties and drilling prospects, maximizing production
from oil and natural gas properties, and developing and executing financing strategies. The loss of any of these individuals could
have a material adverse effect on our operations and business prospects. Our success may be dependent on our ability to continue
to hire, retain and utilize skilled executive and technical personnel. 

Environmental
and Regulatory Risks 

Our
business and operations are subject to and impacted by a wide array of federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing
the exploration for and development, production, and marketing of oil and natural gas, the operation of oil and natural gas wells,
taxation, and environmental and safety matters. Many laws and regulations require drilling permits and govern the spacing of wells,
rates of production, water, waste use and disposal, prevention of waste hydraulic fracturing, and other matters. From time to
time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production in order to conserve supplies of oil and natural
gas. In addition, the production, handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of oil and natural gas, byproducts thereof,
and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and natural gas operations are subject to regulation
under federal, state, and local laws and regulations. 

Compliance
with these regulations may constitute a significant cost and effort for the Company. To date, no specific accounting for environmental
compliance has been maintained or projected by the Company. The Company does not presently know of any environmental demands,
claims, adverse actions, litigation, or administrative proceedings in which it or the acquired properties are involved or subject
to or arising out of its predecessor operations. 

25 

In
the event of a violation of environmental regulations, these environmental regulatory agencies have a broad range of alternative
or cumulative remedies including ordering a cleanup of any spills or waste material and restoration of the soil or water to conditions
existing prior to the environmental violation; fines; or enjoining further drilling, completion or production activities. 

Going
Concern 

There
can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve its business plan, raise additional capital, or secure the additional
financing necessary to implement its current operating plan. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company has yet to achieve profitable operations, expects to incur further losses in the development of its business, has negative
cash flows from operating activities, and is dependent upon future issuances of equity or other financings to fund ongoing operations,
all of which raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s ability
to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate future profitable operations or to obtain the necessary
financing from shareholders or other sources to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations
when they come due. Management has no formal plan in place to address this concern. Still, it considers that the Company will
be able to obtain additional funds by equity financing or related party advances. However, there is no assurance of additional
funding being available or on acceptable terms, if at all.

3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We
are a smaller reporting company and are not required to provide this information. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of William R. Downs, our principal executive officer, and Jeffrey J. Guzy, our principal financial
officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period
covered by this Quarterly Report, pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls
and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures
must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating
the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 

Based
on management s evaluation, Messrs. Downs and Guzy concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of
the period covered by this report were not effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that
we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to the Company s
management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

We
will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal controls over
financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or
improvements, as necessary and as funds allow. 

Changes
in internal control over financial reporting 

We
regularly review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve
controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include
such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, consolidating activities, and migrating processes. 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024,
that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item
2. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities and Use of Proceeds 

Except
as set forth below, there were no sales of equity securities sold during the period covered by this Report that were not registered
under the Securities Act and were not previously reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company. 

On
August 20, 2024, the Company issued 475,000 shares of common stock to Jeffrey. J. Guzy, the Company s Chief Financial Officer
and a director, reflecting Mr. Guzy s purchase of 475,000 shares of common stock from Wm. Barrett Wellman, the former Chief
Financial Officer, in a negotiated transaction.
