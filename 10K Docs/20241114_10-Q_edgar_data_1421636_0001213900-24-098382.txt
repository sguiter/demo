the Company had cash of . These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern
for a period of twelve months from the issuance date of this report. Management cannot provide assurance that the Company will ultimately
achieve profitable operations or become cash flow positive or raise additional debt and/or equity capital. The Company is seeking to raise
capital through additional debt and/or equity financings to fund its operations in the future. Although the Company has historically raised
capital from sales of common shares and preferred shares, and from the issuance of promissory notes and convertible promissory notes,
there is no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital or secure additional
lending in the near future, management expects that the Company will need to curtail its operations. These unaudited consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

volume weighted average price of the common stock during the two years preceding or subsequent two years following the Issuance Date,
subject to adjustment as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Designations (the Conversion Price ). 

In the event of a conversion of any Series B,
the Company shall issue to the holder a number of shares of common stock equal to the sum of the Stated Value plus accrued but unpaid
dividends multiplied by the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock being converted divided by the Conversion Price. 

Upon liquidation of the Company after payment

the holders of Series B will have functional voting control in situations requiring shareholder vote.

liquidation event. A deemed liquidation event includes a change of control which is not in the Company s control. As such, since
Series B preferred stock is redeemable upon the occurrence of an event that is not within the Company s control, the Series B preferred
stock is classified as temporary equity. 

The Company concluded that the Series B Preferred
Stock represented an equity host and, therefore, the redemption feature of the Series B Preferred Stock was not considered to be clearly
and closely related to the associated equity host instrument. However, the redemption features did not meet the net settlement criteria
of a derivative and, therefore, were not considered embedded derivatives that required bifurcation. The Company also concluded that the
conversion rights under the Series B Preferred Stock were clearly and closely related to the equity host instrument. Accordingly, the
conversion rights feature on the Series B Preferred Stock were not considered an embedded derivative that required bifurcation. The conversion
feature of the Series B Preferred Stock at the time of issuance was determined to be beneficial on the commitment date.

The following discussion
highlights our results of operations and the principal factors that have affected our financial condition as well as our liquidity and
capital resources for the periods described and provides information that management believes is relevant for an assessment and understanding
of the statements of financial condition and results of operations presented herein. The following discussion and analysis are based on
our consolidated financial statements contained in this Report, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles GAAP ). You should read the discussion and analysis together with such financial statements and the
related notes thereto. 

Going Concern 

These unaudited consolidated
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities
and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements, we had
a net loss of 1,226,346 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net cash used in operations was 1,136,520 and 1,228,280 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit,
shareholders deficit, and working capital deficit of 62,094,359, 4,869,010 and 1,786,279, respectively. On September 30, 2024,
we had cash of 21,673. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of twelve
months from the issuance date of this report. Management cannot provide assurance that we will ultimately achieve profitable operations
or become cash flow positive or raise additional debt and/or equity capital. We are seeking to raise capital through additional debt and/or
equity financings to fund our operations in the future. Although we have historically raised capital from sales of common shares and preferred
shares, and from the issuance of promissory notes and convertible promissory notes, there is no assurance that we will be able to continue
to do so. If we are unable to raise additional capital or secure additional lending in the near future, management expects that we will
need to curtail our operations. These unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability
and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue
as a going concern.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The following discussion
and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations are based upon our unaudited consolidated
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation
of these unaudited consolidated financial statements require management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management continually evaluates
such estimates, including those related to critical estimates for estimates used in the calculation of percentage of completion on uncompleted
jobs, assumptions used in assessing impairment of long-term assets, and the fair value of non-cash equity transactions. Management bases
its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Any future changes to these estimates and assumptions could cause a material change to our reported amounts of revenues,
expenses, assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management
believes the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the
unaudited consolidated financial statements. 

Revenue recognition 

We follow the Financial
Accounting Standards Board s (the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 606, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 ). This standard establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use
in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most of the existing revenue recognition guidance. ASC
606 requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects
the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services and requires certain additional disclosures. 

We sell our products, which
include standard warranties primarily to distributors and authorized dealers. Product sales are recognized at a point in time when the
product is shipped to the customer and title is transferred and are recorded net of any discounts or allowances. The warranty does not
represent a separate performance obligation. 

Revenues from contracts
for the distribution and installation of window film solutions are recognized over time on the basis of the Company s estimates
of the progress towards completion of contracts using various output or input methods depending on the type of contract terms including
(1) the ratio of number of labor hours spent compared to the number of estimated labor hours to complete a job, (2) using the milestone
method, or (3) using a units completed method. These methods are used because management considers these to be the best available measure
of progress on these contracts. We use the same method for similar types of contracts. The asset, contract assets represents
revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed. The liability, contract liabilities, represents billings in excess of revenues
recognized. 

Stock-based compensation 

Stock-based compensation
is accounted for based on the requirements of ASC 718 Compensation Stock Compensation , which requires
recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee, director, and non-employee services received in exchange for an award
of equity instruments over the period the employee, director, or non-employee is required to perform the services in exchange for the
award (presumptively, the vesting period). The ASC also requires measurement of the cost of employee, director, and non-employee services
received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The Company has elected to recognize forfeitures as
they occur as permitted under Accounting Standards Update ASU 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment . 

See Note 2 to our unaudited
consolidated financial statements for a summary of significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements.

Results of Operations 

The following comparative
analysis on results of operations was based primarily on the comparative consolidated financial statements, footnotes and related information
for the periods identified below and should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and the notes
to those statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, which are included elsewhere in this quarterly report
on Form 10-Q. The results discussed below are for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Comparison of Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Sales 

For the three months ended
September 30, 2024, sales amounted to 659,881 as compared to 813,951 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 154,070,
or 18.9 , primarily attributable to a decrease in window tint installation and services to school districts in Texas. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, sales amounted to 2,460,218 as compared to 1,743,226 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase
of 716,992, or 41.1 . Thise increase was attributable to an increase in sales of window tint installation and services to school districts
in Texas. The Texas Education Agency (TEA) mandated that each school district and open-enrollment charter school install either entry-resistant
film or fencing on ground-floor windows that would allow access, glass doors, and windows adjacent to glass doors. Additionally, we had
an increase in sales from the sales of C-Bond Secure multi-purpose and BRS ballistic resistant glass protection systems. These increases
were offset by a decrease in sales of our recently sold C-Bond nanoShield solutions product line of 112,413 during the nine months
ended September 2024 and compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to product line sale in May 2023, and a decrease in
freight and delivery sales. 

Cost of Goods Sold 

In connection with our C-Bond
Solutions segment, cost of goods sold was comprised primarily of the cost of raw materials and finished inventory sold, packaging costs,
and warranty costs. In connection with our Patriot Glass segment, cost of goods sold is comprised primarily of cost of raw materials such
as film, labor, subcontractor costs, equipment rental, and supplies. 

For the three months ended
September 30, 2024, cost of sales amounted to 381,773 as compared to 346,611 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase

Compensation and related
benefits 

For the three months ended
September 30, 2024, compensation and related benefits increased by 94,526, or 30.6 , as compared to the three months ended September
30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to an overall increase in executive compensation and related benefits of 71,752 and an increase
in sales compensation and related benefits of 22,774. 

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, compensation and related benefits increased by 379,140, or 32.2 , as compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation of 334,785, and an overall increase in compensation
and related benefits of 44,355. 

On January 2, 2024, the
Board of Directors of the Company agreed to satisfy 312,000 of accrued compensation owed to its executive officers (collectively, the
 Management as of December 31, 2023, which was included in accrued compensation on the accompanying unaudited consolidated
balance sheet. Management agreed to accept 312 shares of the Company s Series B convertible preferred stock in settlement of this
accrued compensation. The conversion feature of the Series B Preferred Stock at the time of issuance was determined to be beneficial on
the commitment date. Because the Series B Preferred Stock was perpetual with no stated maturity date, and the conversions could occur
any time from the date of issuance, the Company immediately recorded non-cash stock-based compensation of 281,807 related to the beneficial
conversion feature arising from the issuance of Series B Preferred Stock. Additionally, on January 2, 2024, the Board of Directors
of the Company agreed to issue 50 shares of the Company s Series B convertible preferred stock to a director for services rendered.
The conversion feature of the Series B Preferred Stock at the time of issuance was determined to be beneficial on the commitment date.
Because the Series B Preferred Stock was perpetual with no stated maturity date, and the conversions could occur any time from the date
of issuance, the Company immediately recorded non-cash stock-based compensation of 95,161, which consisted of (i) 50,000 of Series B
stated value and (ii) 45,161 related to the beneficial conversion feature arising from the issuance of Series B Preferred Stock. 

Professional fees 

For the three months ended
September 30, 2024, professional fees decreased by 24,191, or 21.8 , as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease
was primarily related to a decrease in consulting fees of 36,180, offset by an increase in other professional fees of 11,989. 

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, professional fees decreased by 175,530, or 35.7 , as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease
was primarily related to a decrease in consulting fees of 170,814 and a decrease in legal fees of 30,363, offset by an increase in accounting
fees of 7,631 and a net increase in other professional fees of 18,016. 

General and administrative 

For the three months ended
September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses decreased by 11,139, or 6.9 , as compared to the three months ended September
30, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in bad debt expense of 17,987, offset by an increase in other selling,
general and administrative expenses of 6,848. 

49 

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses increased by 32,605, or 6.7 , as compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in bad debt expense of 5,107, an increase in advertising expense of 21,102,
an increase in other selling, general and administrative expenses of 21,465, an increase in depreciation expense of 11,152, and an increase
in shipping and handling expense of 8,080, offset by a decrease in rent of 34,301 associated with the sale of the C-Bond nanoShield 
product line in May 2023. 

Other Operating Income 

During the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, we reported a gain on sale of our nanoShield product line of 0 and 4,051,709, respectively. We did
not record any other operating income during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

(Loss) Income from Operations

a negative change of 4,038,551, or 142.1 . 

Other Income (Expenses), net 

For the three months ended
September 30, 2024, other expenses, net amounted to 309,670 as compared to 49,437 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an
increase of 260,233, or 526.4 . This change was primarily due to an increase in interest expense of 29,763 related to an increase in
interest-bearing debt, which includes an increase in merchant loans with high interest rates. Additionally, during the three months ended
September 30, 2024, we recorded a loss on debt extinguishment aggregating 221,220 that included the recording of a put premium expense
of 189,642 and the write off of remaining debt discount of 31,578, both which were related to the amendment of certain notes payable. 

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, other income (expenses), net amounted to (29,407) as compared to 45,506 for the nine months ended September 30,
2023, a negative change of 74,913, or 164.6 . This change was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense of 270,148 related to
an average decrease in interest-bearing debt during the period, offset by a decrease in gain on debt extinguishment of 345,061 related
to the reversal of previously accrued compensation and settlement of debt. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
we recorded a loss on debt extinguishment aggregating 221,220 that included the recording of a put premium expense of 189,642 and the

stock of (11,008) and the add back of net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of 36,524, amounted to (647,213), or (0.00)
per common share (basic and diluted). For the three months ended September 30, 2023, net loss attributable to common shareholders, which
included dividends accrued on Series B and C preferred stock of 13,483 and the addition of net (income) attributable to noncontrolling
interests of 28,657, amounted to (206,208), or (0.00) per common shares (basic and diluted).

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Liquidity is the ability
of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for cash requirements. We had cash of 21,673 and 736,461 as
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Our primary uses of cash
have been for compensation and related benefits, fees paid to third parties for professional services, and general and administrative
expenses. Historically, we have received funds from the sales of products, from various financing activities such as from the sale of
our common shares, from the sale of preferred shares and from debt financings. The following trends are reasonably likely to result in
changes in our liquidity over the near to long term: 

An increase in working capital requirements to finance our current business, 

Addition of administrative and sales personnel needed for business growth; 

The cost of being a public company; 

Marketing expense for building brand; 

Capital requirements for production capacity. 

Working capital requirements to support acquired companies. 

Recent Fundings 

On March 1, 2024, we executed
a Promissory Note (the March 2024 Note in favor of Diagonal in the aggregate principal amount of 157,000 (the Principal ),
and an accompanying Securities Purchase Agreement SPA ). Through August 15, 2024, the March 2024 Note was only convertible
into shares of the Company s common stock in the event of a default. On August 15, 2024, we entered into two amendments to the March
2024 Note. The amendments to the March 2024 Note changed the number and dollar amount of mandatory monthly payments to be paid to 9 payments,
each in the amount of 17,877 (a total payback to the Holder of 160,893). The first payment shall be due August 30, 2024, with 8 subsequent
payments due on the 30th day of each month thereafter. The amendments to the March 2024 Note also made the March 2024 Note convertible
at any time at Diagonal s option and changed the conversion price to 65 multiplied by the lowest closing bid price during the 10
trading days prior to the conversion date (representing a discount rate of 35 ). All other terms in the March 2024 Note remain the same.
Among other things, an event of default Event of Default shall occur if the Company fails to pay the principal or interest
when due on the March 2024 Note, whether at maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, the
March 2024 Note shall become immediately due and payable and the Company shall pay to the Investor, in full satisfaction of its obligations
hereunder, an amount equal to 220 times the sum of the then outstanding principal amount of this March 2024 Note plus accrued and unpaid
interest on the unpaid principal amount of this March 2024 Note to the date of payment plus Default Interest, if any. At no time may the
Note be converted into shares of our common stock if such conversion would result in the Investor and its affiliates owning an aggregate
of in excess of 4.99 of the then outstanding shares of our common stock. As of September 30, 2024, the principal balance of the March
2024 Note was 139,548. 

On April 8, 2024, we executed
a Promissory Note (the April 2024 Note in favor of Diagonal in the aggregate principal amount of 127,693 (the Principal ),
and an accompanying Securities Purchase Agreement SPA ). The April 2024 Note was funded on April 10, 2024, in the amount
of 100,000. Through August 15, 2024, the April 2024 Note was only convertible into shares of the Company s common stock in the
event of a default. On August 15, 2024, the Company entered into two amendments to its April 2024 Note in favor of Diagonal in the principal
amount of 127,693. The amendments to the April 2024 Note changed the number and dollar amount of mandatory monthly payments to be paid
to 9 payments, each in the amount of 21,980 (a total payback to the Holder of 197,820). The first payment shall be due August 13, 2024,
with 8 subsequent payments due on the 15th day of each month thereafter. The amendments to the April 2024 Note also made the April 2024
Note convertible at any time at Diagonal s option and changed the conversion price to 65 multiplied by the lowest closing bid price
during the 10 trading days prior to the conversion date (representing a discount rate of 35 ). All other terms in the April 2024 Note
remain the same. A one-time interest charge of 12 (the Interest Rate shall be applied on the issuance date to the Principal.
Under the terms of the original April 2024 Note, the Company was required to make monthly payments beginning on August 15, 2024. Any amount
of principal or interest on the April 2024 Note which is not paid when due shall bear interest at the rate of 22 per annum from the due
date thereof until the same is paid Default Interest ). Among other things, an event of default Event of Default shall occur if the Company fails to pay the principal or interest when due on the Note, whether at maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise.
Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, the April 2024 Note shall become immediately due and payable and the Company shall pay to
the Investor, in full satisfaction of its obligations hereunder, an amount equal to 220 times the sum of the then outstanding principal
amount of this April 2024 Note plus accrued and unpaid interest on the unpaid principal amount of this April 2024 Note to the date of
payment plus Default Interest, if any. At no time may the April 2024 Note be converted into shares of our common stock if such conversion
would result in the Investor and its affiliates owning an aggregate of in excess of 4.99 of the then outstanding shares As of September
30, 2024, the principal balance of the April 2024 Note was 97,407.

 50,000, net of original issue discount and fees of 17,500. Under the terms of the June 2024 Note, the Company is required to make nine
monthly payments of principal and interest of 8,775 beginning on July 15, 2024. Any amount of principal or interest on the April 2024
Note which is not paid when due shall bear interest at the rate of 22 per annum from the due date thereof until the same is paid Default
Interest ). Through August 15, 2024, the June 2024 Note was only convertible into shares of the Company s common stock in
the event of a default. On August 15, 2024, we entered into an amendment to its June 2024 Note in favor of Diagonal in the principal amount
of 67,500. The amendment to the June 2024 Note made the June 2024 Note convertible at any time at Diagonal s option and changed
the conversion price to 65 multiplied by the lowest closing bid price during the 10 trading days prior to the conversion date (representing
a discount rate of 35 ). All other terms in the June 2024 Note remain the same. Accordingly, on August 15, 2024, the principal amount
outstanding of 47,453 was reclassified from notes to convertible notes payable (See Note 8). Among other things, an event of default Event of Default shall occur if the Company fails to pay the principal or interest when due on the June 2024 Note, whether
at maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, the June 2024 Note shall become immediately

times the sum of the then outstanding principal amount of this June 2024 Note plus accrued and unpaid interest on the unpaid principal
amount of this June 2024 Note to the date of payment plus Default Interest, if any. At no time may the June 2024 Note be converted into

Summary 

As of September 30, 2024,
we determined that there was substantial doubt about our ability to maintain operations as a going concern. Our unaudited consolidated
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities
and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements, the Company
had a net loss of 1,226,346 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net cash used in operations was 1,136,520 and 1,228,280 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated
deficit, shareholders deficit, and working capital deficit of 62,094,359, 4,869,010 and 1,786,279, respectively. Management
cannot provide assurance that we will ultimately achieve profitable operations or become cash flow positive or raise additional debt and/or
equity capital. We will seek to raise capital through additional debt and/or equity financings to fund operations in the future. Although
we have historically raised capital from sales of common and preferred shares, from the issuance of notes payable, and from the issuance
of convertible promissory notes, there is no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so. If we are unable to raise additional
capital or secure additional lending in the near future, management expects that the Company will need to curtail its operations. Our
unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets
or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Our forecast of the period
of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves
risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially because of a number of factors. We have based this estimate on assumptions
that may prove to be wrong and could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our capital requirements
are difficult to forecast. Please see the section titled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC, for additional risks associated with our capital requirements. 

Until such time as we generate
substantial product revenue to offset operational expenses, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public and private
equity offerings and debt financings. We may be unable to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements when needed or on favorable
terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on
our financial condition. 

Additional cash liquidity
is generated from product sales. However, to date, we are not profitable, and we cannot provide any assurances that we will be profitable.
We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund our current operating plans.

Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

Contractual Obligations

obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest
rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing
and amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented
in the tables, to assist in the review of this information within the context of our consolidated financial position, results of operations,

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance
sheet arrangements during the period presented as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Not applicable to smaller
reporting companies. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure
controls and procedures, as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e), promulgated by the SEC pursuant to the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. Our management, with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated our disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective. 

As reported in Item 9A of
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, our management concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was not effective as of that date because of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. The ineffectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures was due to the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting:
(1) the lack of multiples levels of management review on complex business, accounting and financial reporting issues, and (2) a lack of
adequate segregation of duties as a result of our limited financial resources to support hiring of personnel. 

Until such time as we expand
our staff to include additional accounting and executive personnel, it is likely we will continue to report material weaknesses in our
internal control over financial reporting. 

A material weakness is a
deficiency or a combination of control deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes in
our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

55 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From time to time, we may
become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject
to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm business. 

Except as set forth below,
the Company is not involved in any pending or threatened legal proceedings that it believes could reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 

On March 8, 2021, a former
officer of the Company resigned. Both parties alleged certain claims against the other, including with respect to certain compensation
claims. Neither party has filed litigation. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against any possible claims and assert any
relevant claims against the former executive and believes it will prevail. The Board of Directors of the Company have resolved and taken
action in February 2024 to cause the forfeiture of equity and deferred compensation owed/outstanding by said officer. Accordingly, on
February 8, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company determined that 120 shares of Series B convertible preferred stock and 5,250,000
shares of the Company s common stock shall be forfeited (See Note 9). Additionally, on February 8, 2024, the Company reversed accrued
compensation that was outstanding to this former officer as of December 31, 2023 of 347,097 and accordingly, during the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a gain on debt extinguishment of 347,097. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

There have been no material
changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

None. 

ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES 

On October 21, 2024, we received
a notice default stating that the Company is now in default of its Notes Payable with an investor for non-payment of the October 2024
installment payment due. Demand was made for the immediate payment (as provided in the Notes) of a sum representing 220 of the remaining
outstanding principal balances (in the aggregate, 140,086 (March Note balance) + 99,056 (April Note balance) + 52,650 (June Note balance)
 2.2= 641,942), together with accrued interest and Default Interest as provided for in the Notes. 

ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES 

Not applicable. 

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION 

(a) None. 

(b) There have been no material
changes to the procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to the Company s Board of Directors since the Company
last provided disclosure in response to the requirements of Item 407(c)(3) of Regulation S-K. 

(c) During the quarter ended
September 30, 2024, no director or officer of the Company or a contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase
or sale of securities of the Company intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) and/or a non-Rule 10b5-1
