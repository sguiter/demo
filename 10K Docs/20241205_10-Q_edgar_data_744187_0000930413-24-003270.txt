Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations 

Ethanol and By-Products 

At October 31, 2024, we
had investments in three ethanol limited liability companies, in two of which we have a majority ownership interest. The following
table is a summary of ethanol entity ownership interests at October 31, 2024:

Our ethanol operations and the results thereof
are highly dependent on commodity prices, especially prices for corn, ethanol, distillers grains, distillers corn oil and natural
gas, and availability of corn. As a result of price volatility for these commodities, our operating results can fluctuate substantially.
The price and availability of corn is subject to significant fluctuations depending upon several factors that affect commodity
prices in general, including crop conditions, the amount of corn stored on farms, weather, federal policy, foreign trade, and international
disruptions caused by wars or conflicts. Because the market prices of ethanol and distillers grains are not always directly related
to corn prices (for example, demand for crude and other energy and related prices, the export market demand for ethanol and distillers
grains, soybean meal prices, and the results of federal policy decisions and trade negotiations can impact ethanol and distillers
grains prices), at times ethanol and distillers grains prices may not follow movements in corn prices and, in an environment of
higher corn prices or lower ethanol or distillers grains prices, reduce the overall margin structure at the plants. As a result,
at times, we may operate our plants at negative or minimally positive operating margins. 

We expect our ethanol plants to produce approximately
2.9 gallons of denatured ethanol for each bushel of corn processed in the production cycle. We refer to the actual gallons of denatured
ethanol produced per bushel of corn processed as the realized yield. We refer to the difference between the price per gallon of
ethanol and the price per bushel of corn (divided by the realized yield) as the crush spread . Should the crush spread
decline, it is possible that our ethanol plants will generate operating results that do not provide adequate cash flows for sustained
periods of time. In such cases, production at the ethanol plants may be reduced or stopped altogether in order to minimize variable
costs at individual plants. 

We attempt to manage the risk related to
the volatility of commodity prices by utilizing forward corn and natural gas purchase contracts, forward ethanol, distillers grains
and distillers corn oil sale contracts and commodity futures agreements, as management deems appropriate. We attempt to match quantities
of these sale contracts with an appropriate quantity of corn purchase contracts over a given period of time when we can obtain
an adequate gross margin resulting from the crush spread inherent in the contracts we have executed. However, the market for future
ethanol sales contracts generally lags the spot 

23 

market with respect to ethanol price. Consequently, we generally
execute fixed price ethanol contracts for no more than four months into the future at any given time and we may lock in our corn
or ethanol price without having a corresponding locked in ethanol or corn price for short durations of time. As a result of the
relatively short period of time during which our fixed price contracts are fulfilled, we generally cannot predict the future movements
in our realized crush spread for more than four months; thus, we are unable to predict the likelihood or amounts of future income
or loss from the operations of our ethanol facilities. We utilize derivative financial instruments, primarily exchange traded commodity
future contracts and swap contracts, in conjunction with certain of our corn procurement activities and commodity marketing activities. 

One Earth Energy, LLC Carbon Sequestration and Plant Expansion 

Through our affiliate, One Earth Energy,
LLC, we are in the developmental stage of a carbon sequestration project near the One Earth Energy ethanol plant in Gibson City,
IL. A test well has been drilled to a total depth of approximately 7,100 feet, in which almost 2,000 feet of Mt. Simon Sandstone
was encountered, which is the geological formation that is the region s primary carbon storage resource. Three-dimensional
seismic testing has been performed, as well as geological modeling for predicting the movement of injected carbon and the plume
area to determine maximum injection pressure, reservoir quality and storage capacity for the potential wells. In October 2022,
we applied for a Class VI injection well permit for three wells with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA ),
and we continue to provide information to the EPA during the technical review of our application upon request. We currently expect
the EPA to prepare a draft permit by the first quarter of 2025 and make a final permit decision by the third quarter of 2025, according
to the EPA s Class VI Permit Tracker Dashboard on their website. We have now secured sufficient subsurface easements for
the proposed first injection well to allow for sequestration of all the carbon emissions from the One Earth Energy ethanol plant
for a minimum of 15 years. We also need to obtain a county special-use zoning permit for the sequestration site. Last year, we
began construction of a facility to capture, dehydrate, and compress carbon dioxide from the One Earth Energy ethanol plant to
a state suitable for sequestration. We are nearing the completion of construction of the capture and compression facility. 

In October 2023, we submitted an application
to the Illinois Commerce Commission ICC for a certificate of authority under the state s Carbon Dioxide Transportation
and Sequestration Act (the CO 2 Act to build a short pipeline to deliver carbon dioxide from the One Earth
Energy ethanol plant to the proposed sequestration site. We also have obtained easements from all of the necessary landowners for
the use of their land for the pipeline for the first two wells. On May 26, 2024, however, the Illinois General Assembly passed
the Safety and Aid for the Environment in Carbon Capture and Sequestration Act (Senate Bill 1289), which was signed by the governor
in July 2024. The new legislation imposes additional safety, environmental and other requirements on obtaining permits and approvals
for carbon capture and sequestration facilities in Illinois, including CO 2 pipelines. Further, the new legislation imposes
a moratorium on the issuance of new certificates of authority for the construction of CO 2 pipelines until the earlier
of the date proposed federal CO 2 pipeline safety standards are finalized by the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials
Safety Administration (PHMSA) or, subject to certain other conditions, July 1, 2026. As a result of this legislation, the ICC dismissed
our application without prejudice, and we will be required to resubmit an application after rules are finalized or subsequent to
July 1, 2026. 

Although we have made meaningful progress
and significant investments in the carbon sequestration project at One Earth Energy, we continue to work with the various government
agencies 

24 

involved to obtain all required permits and approvals, with
no assurance of the ultimate success or timing of the project. Also see the discussion under Trends and Uncertainties 
on page 27 of certain recently proposed legislation that, if enacted, could impact our carbon sequestration project. 

We also are concurrently expanding the One
Earth ethanol plant. We received a construction permit from the EPA to increase production from 150 million gallons of ethanol
per year to 175 million gallons of ethanol per year. Once we achieve that level of production, planned for the third quarter of
fiscal 2025, we intend to apply for another permit to further increase production to 200 million gallon per year. 

We continue to work to identify ways to reduce
our carbon intensity CI score at the One Earth plant with the intention of maximizing the tax credits available
under the Inflation Reduction Act, which created a new Clean Fuel Production Credit under 45Z of the Internal Revenue Code 45Z ),
available for calendar years 2025 2027, of approximately 0.02 per ethanol gallon per CI point reduction below a 50 CI
point threshold to incentivize further increases in plant efficiencies within the industry. The U.S. Department of the Treasury
has not yet issued final rules on qualification for 45Z tax credits. 

We expect the total cost of these projects
to be approximately 165-175 million, which we continue to pay from our available cash. As of October 31, 2024, we have spent 52.9
million life-to-date and are contractually committed to spend an additional 2.4 million toward the carbon sequestration project.
If the carbon sequestration project is successful, we believe we will qualify for tax credits under section 45Q of the Internal
Revenue Code 45Q and section 45Z of the Internal Revenue Code, as outlined in the Inflation Reduction Act, with
45Z credits being subject to final guidance yet to be issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. As of October 31, 2024, we
have spent 50.2 million life-to-date and are contractually committed to spend an additional 7.4 million at the One Earth plant
toward plant capacity expansion and ongoing efforts to reduce our CI scoring. 

Refined Coal 

On August 10, 2017, we purchased, through
a 95.35 owned subsidiary, for approximately 12.0 million, the entire ownership interest of an entity that owned a refined coal
facility. We began operating the refined coal facility immediately after the acquisition. As the plant was no longer eligible to
receive federal production tax credits beginning on November 18, 2021, we ceased operations on that date. We began classifying
this operation as discontinued operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Over the course of operation, we recognized 58.2
million in tax credits. The federal production tax credits received through operation of this facility remain under IRS audit. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

During the three months ended October 31,
2024, we did not change any of our critical accounting policies as disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 29, 2024.

Trends and Uncertainties 

Renewable Fuel Standard
II RFS II ), established in October 2010, has been an important factor in the growth of ethanol usage in the United
States. In recent years, there has been much uncertainty in the enforcement of RFS II. When it was originally established, RFS
II required the volume of conventional or corn derived ethanol to be blended with gasoline to increase each year
until it reached 15.0 billion gallons in 2015 and required that it remain at that level through 2022. There are no established
congressional target volumes beginning in 2023, with the EPA to issue volume obligations in those subsequent years. The EPA also
has the authority to waive the biofuel mandate, in whole or in part, if there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply or the
requirement severely harms the domestic economy or environment. 

In addition, under RFS
II, a small refiner that processes less than 75,000 barrels of oil per day can petition the EPA for a waiver of their obligation
to submit renewable identification numbers RINs ). The EPA, through consultation with the Department of Energy and
the U.S. Department of Agriculture USDA ), can grant the refiner a full or partial waiver, or deny the waiver petition.
The EPA issued 88 small refinery exemptions SREs for the 2016-2018 compliance years, undercutting the statutory
renewable fuel volumes by a total of 4.3 billion gallons. The EPA did not grant any small refinery waivers for 2019-2022 and has
continued that stance in the proposed volumes for 2023-2025. There remain multiple ongoing legal challenges to how the EPA has
handled the small refinery waivers. In July 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated many of
the EPA s 2022 SRE denials. The EPA had denied 105 SREs in 2022. As a result of this Court ruling, the EPA has voluntarily
moved to rescind the agency s 2023 denial of 26 SREs. On November 21, 2024, the EPA reported that 130 SRE petitions were
then pending under the RFS, up from 50 as of mid-September. The increase is attributed to submissions from small refineries seeking
reconsideration of petitions that were previously denied. 

The EPA has issued Renewable
Fuel Standard volume obligations for calendar years 2023-2025 for conventional biofuels (which includes corn-based ethanol) of
15.0 billion gallons for each year. Additionally, for 2023, the EPA restored 250 million gallons previously waived. 

The Inflation Reduction
Act will likely impact our business by creating a new Clean Fuel Production Credit, section 45Z of the Internal Revenue Code 45Z ),
available for the years 2025 to 2027. The Clean Fuel Production Credit is approximately 0.02 per ethanol gallon per CI point reduction
below a 50 CI point threshold. The Act also raises the carbon capture tax credit from 50 per metric ton to 85 per metric ton
under section 45Q. Taxpayers may elect to be treated as making a payment against tax for 100 

26 

of the value of the 45Q
credit direct pay for the first five years, starting with the year a qualifying carbon sequestration facility is
placed in service, but not beyond December 31, 2032. Companies may elect either the 45Q credit or the 45Z credit in periods in
which both tax credits are available. Other potential impacts of the Inflation Reduction Act include (a) extension of the biodiesel
tax credit, which could support the value of our renewable corn oil, as this co-product serves as a low-carbon feedstock for renewable
diesel and biomass based diesel production; (b) creation of new tax credit for sustainable aviation fuel SAF (c)
funding of biofuel refueling infrastructure which could increase the availability of higher level ethanol blended fuel; and (d)
provision for production and purchase credits for electric vehicles, which could reduce the amount of internal combustion engines
on the road over time, and ultimately reduce the demand for gasoline, diesel fuels and ethanol. 

In April 2024, the U.S
Department of the Treasury and the IRS released updated guidance which included an updated GREET (Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions,
and Energy use in Technologies) lifecycle model for the section 40B SAF tax credit. This model provides a pathway for U.S. corn-based
ethanol to be considered a qualifying feedstock for SAF if certain measures are taken to lower carbon intensity of production.
GREET is used as a model to calculate greenhouse gas GHG reductions. The GREET model aims to provide a comprehensive
assessment of the environmental impact of aviation fuels focusing on reducing GHG emissions through the entire lifecycle of the
fuel, including through carbon capture and certain climate-smart agricultural CSA) practices. CSA practices for corn production
must include no-till farming, planting cover crops and using enhanced efficiency nitrogen fertilizers. The section 40B credit expires
on December 31, 2024 and is being replaced by the 45Z tax credit. A new 45Z-GREET model has not yet been developed by the U.S.
Department of the Treasury, but will likely require further modeling, data assumptions, and verification. 

Illinois Senate Bill 3968,
which was recently introduced into the Illinois Senate and assigned to the Executive Senate Committee would, if eventually enacted,
ban carbon sequestration projects if they overlie, underlie, or pass through a sole-source aquifer, including the aquifer s
upstream areas that are part of the aquifer s project review area, as identified by the U.S. EPA. On November 14, 2024, the
Executive Senate Committee paused the bill until they can gather additional information. The first well for our proposed carbon
sequestration project is located inside, at the edge of the Mahomet Sole Source Aquifer Project Review Area, within the Sangamon
River near Fisher Upstream Area. It is approximately five miles north of the Sangamon River and nearly six miles from the mapped
boundary of the Mahomet Aquifer, which has been designated as a sole source or principal aquifer by the U.S. EPA. We believe our
second and third sequestration well sites are outside the Mahomet Sole Source Aquifer Project Review Area. The Company is closely
monitoring this bill and any impact it would have on our project. 

Additionally, see One Earth Energy,
LLC Carbon Sequestration and Plant Expansion above for a discussion of certain other uncertainties associated with our Illinois
carbon sequestration and plant expansion projects. 

The trends and uncertainties mentioned above
could impact our future operating results in both positive and negative ways.

Net sales and revenue
in the quarter ended October 31, 2024 decreased 21 compared to the prior year s third quarter. Net sales and revenue in
the first nine months ended October 31, 2024 decreased approximately 25 compared to the first nine months of 2023. 

Ethanol revenue decreased
19 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 as the average selling price of
ethanol at our consolidated plants decreased 21 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 compared to the prior year comparable
period, partially offset by a 3 increase in gallons of ethanol sold. Ethanol revenue decreased 25 in the first nine months of
fiscal year 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2023, driven by a 25 decrease in selling price while gallons
sold did not change significantly. The decrease in the ethanol selling price resulted primarily from a decrease in corn prices
as the market price for ethanol often correlates with the market price for corn. 

Dried distillers grains
revenue decreased 28 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 as the average
price per ton sold decreased 25 , coupled with a 5 decrease in tons sold. Dried distillers grains revenue decreased 27 in the
first nine months of fiscal year 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2023, driven by a 25 decrease in the average
selling price, along with a 3 decrease in the tons sold. The decrease in the dried distillers grains selling price resulted primarily
from a decrease in corn prices as dried distillers grains prices often correlate with corn pricing. 

Distillers corn oil revenue
decreased approximately 31 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 as the average
price per pound sold decreased 28 , along with a 3 decrease in pounds sold. Distillers corn oil revenue decreased 27 in the first
nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 as the average price per pound decreased 27 , along with 

29 

a 1 decrease in pounds
sold. The decrease in the distillers corn oil selling price resulted primarily from fluctuations in demand with the renewable biodiesel
market and is often tied to the price of soybean oil. 

Modified distillers grains
revenue did not change in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 due to a 36 
increase in the tons sold, offset by a decrease in the average selling price per ton sold of 27 . Modified distillers grains revenue
decreased 9 in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2023 due to a 34 decrease
in the average selling price per ton sold, offset by a 39 increase in tons sold during the same period. The decrease in the modified
distillers grains selling price resulted primarily from a decrease in corn prices as prices tend to move in the same direction.
Our consolidated plants decisions to sell modified or dried distillers grains fluctuate from time to time based upon market
conditions. 

Gains on derivative financial
instruments, included in net sales and revenue, were approximately 0.3 million in the three-month period ended October 31, 2024,
compared to no gain or loss on derivative financial instruments during the three-month period ended October 31, 2023. Gains on
derivative financial instruments, included in net sales and revenue, were approximately 0.7 million in the nine-month period ended
October 31, 2024, compared to losses of 29,000 on derivative financial instruments during the nine-month period ended October
31, 2023. These gains and losses are related to our risk management activities and were impacted by the price movements of ethanol. 

Cost of sales decreased approximately 26 
in the quarter ended October 31, 2024, compared to the prior year third quarter. Corn accounted for approximately 76 102.6 million)
of our cost of sales during the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 compared to approximately 80 145.2 million) during the third
quarter of fiscal year 2023. Natural gas accounted for approximately 3 of our cost of sales during the third quarter of fiscal
year 2024 4.6 million) and the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 6.2 million). Cost of sales decreased approximately 29 in
the nine-months ended October 31, 2024, compared to the prior year comparable period. Corn accounted for approximately 76 312.2
million) of our cost of sales during the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 compared to approximately 81 467.0 million) during
the first nine months of fiscal year 2023. Natural gas accounted for approximately 4 of our cost of sales during the nine months
ended October 31, 2024 15.6 million) and during the first nine months of fiscal year 2023 23.3 million). The cost of corn and
natural gas decreased primarily due to lower pricing for both during the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024. 

As a result of the foregoing,
gross profit for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 increased approximately 0.4 million compared to the prior year s
third quarter. Gross profit for the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 increased approximately 6.1 million compared to the
first nine months of fiscal year 2023. 

We attempt to match quantities
of ethanol, distillers grains and distillers corn oil sales contracts with an appropriate quantity of corn purchase contracts over
a given time period when we can obtain a satisfactory margin resulting from the crush spread inherent in the contracts we have
executed. However, the market for future ethanol sales contracts generally lags the spot market with respect to ethanol price.
Consequently, we generally execute fixed price sales contracts for no more than four months into the future at any given time and
we may lock in our corn or ethanol price without having a corresponding locked in ethanol or corn price for short durations of
time. As a result of the relatively short period of time our contracts cover, we generally cannot predict the future movements
in our realized crush spread for 

30 

more than four months. We
utilize derivative financial instruments, primarily exchange traded commodity future contracts and swap contracts, in conjunction
with certain of our corn procurement activities and commodity marketing activities. 

SG A expenses were approximately 8.4
million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, compared to approximately 7.6 million of expenses for the third quarter of
fiscal year 2023. The increase from the prior year third quarter are due primarily to an increase in railcar lease expense and
an increase in donations of emergency equipment to local first responders related to carbon capture. SG A expenses were approximately
 21.0 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, compared to approximately 22.0 million for the first nine months
of fiscal year 2023. The decrease compared to the prior year nine-month period are primarily related to restricted stock awards
granted to certain executive officers in the second quarter of 2023, which were expensed upon issuance, offset partially by the
increase in performance bonus expense as a result of higher net income in 2024. 

During the third quarter
of fiscal year 2024, we recognized income from our equity investment in Big River of approximately 3.6 million compared to income
of approximately 4.7 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. During the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, we recognized
income from our equity investment in Big River of approximately 7.1 million compared to income of approximately 9.3 million during
the first nine months of fiscal year 2023. Our investment in Big River, which has interests in four ethanol production plants,
represents an effective ownership of approximately 38.5 million gallons of ethanol shipped in the trailing twelve months ended
October 31, 2024. Due to the inherent volatility of commodity prices within the ethanol industry, we cannot predict the likelihood
of future operating results from Big River being similar to historical results. 

Interest and other income
was approximately 4.6 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 versus approximately 4.9 million for the third quarter
of fiscal year 2023. Interest and other income was approximately 15.0 million for the first nine months of 2024 versus approximately
 10.9 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2023. One of our consolidated ethanol plants recognized 1.2 million in
patronage income from an investment in a cooperative in the first quarter of 2024. During
2023, the Company s consolidated plants received COVID-19 relief grants from the USDA of approximately 0.9 million and 1.0
million for the three- and nine-month periods ended October 31, 2023. The remaining change between the year-to-date periods related
to increased interest income in the current year based upon higher balances and yields on our excess cash and short-term
investments in fiscal year 2024, compared to 2023. 

As a result of the foregoing, income before
income taxes was approximately 39.5 million and 41.3 million for the third quarters of fiscal year 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Income before income taxes was approximately 75.0 million and 66.0 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 and
2023, respectively. 

The Company applies an effective tax rate
to interim periods that is consistent with the Company s estimated annual tax rate as adjusted for discrete items impacting
the interim periods. Our income tax provision was approximately 9.4 million and 9.6 million for the three months ended October
31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our income tax provision was approximately 17.6 million and 15.4 million for the first nine
months of fiscal year 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

31 

As
a result of the foregoing, net income was approximately 30.1 for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 compared to approximately
 31.6 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. Net
income was approximately 57.4 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 compared to approximately 50.6 million for
the first nine months of fiscal year 2023. 

Net income attributable
to noncontrolling interests was approximately 5.6 million for the third quarters of fiscal year 2024 and 2023. Net income attributable
to noncontrolling interests was approximately 10.3 million for the first nine months of fiscal years 2024 and 2023. These amounts
represent the other owners share of the income of NuGen and One Earth. 

As
a result of the foregoing, net income attributable to REX common shareholders for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was approximately
 24.5 million, compared to net income attributable to REX common shareholders of approximately 26.1 million for the third quarter
of fiscal year 2023. Net
income attributable to REX common shareholders from the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 was approximately 47.1 million,
compared to net income attributable to REX common shareholders of approximately 40.4 million for the first nine months of fiscal
year 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Net cash provided by
operating activities was approximately 39.1 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, compared to net cash provided
by operating activities of approximately 65.5 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2023. For the first nine months
of fiscal year 2024, cash was provided by net income of approximately 57.4 million, adjusted upward for non-cash items of approximately
 20.3 million, which consisted of depreciation, amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets, income from equity method
investments, interest income from short-term investments, the deferred income tax provision, stock-based compensation expense,
and loss on disposal of property and equipment. We received dividends from Big River of approximately 3.0 million. A decrease
in the balance of accounts receivable provided cash of approximately 0.9 million, primarily a result of the timing of products
shipped and the receipt of customer payments at One Earth and NuGen. Inventories increased over the first nine months of fiscal
year 2024, using cash of approximately 2.1 million. An increase in the balance of other assets of approximately 12.6 million
primarily relates to prepayments on certain executed lease agreements, offset by changes in the carrying value of forward purchase
contracts and commodity futures positions recorded at fair value, decreases to spare parts inventory and decreases to prepaid insurance
balances. A decrease in the balance of refundable income taxes of approximately 0.2 million primarily relates to the accrual of
the federal taxes currently payable and the timing of estimated tax payments for the first nine months of 2024. While the Company
has tax credits available to offset all amounts owed, the Company is limited to using tax credits for only 75 of federal taxes
owed. A decrease in the balance of accounts payable used cash of approximately 21.6 million, which was primarily a result of the
timing of inventory receipts and vendor payments. A decrease in the balance of other liabilities used cash of approximately 6.2
million, which was primarily caused by the reduction in the lease liability of 4.0 million from payments made during the year.
Additionally, a decrease in accrued payroll and accrued utility liabilities used cash of approximately 0.6 million and 1.3 million,
respectively. The decrease in the accrued payroll is primarily related to the payment of the 2023 incentive bonuses, offset partially
by the accrual of the 2024 incentive bonuses to be paid in 2025. Other offsetting fluctuations within other liabilities were insignificant. 

32 

Net cash provided by operating activities
was approximately 65.5 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2023. For the first nine months of fiscal year 2023, cash
was provided by net income of approximately 50.6 million, adjusted for non-cash items of approximately 16.3 million, which consisted
of depreciation, amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets, income from equity method investments, interest income from
short-term investments, the deferred income tax provision, stock-based compensation expense, and loss on disposal of property and
equipment. We received dividends from Big River of approximately 5.5 million. An increase in the balance of accounts receivable
used cash of approximately 5.0 million, primarily a result of the timing of products shipped and the receipt of customer payments
at One Earth and NuGen. Inventories decreased over the first nine months of fiscal year 2023, providing cash of 11.2 million.
An increase in the balance of other assets of approximately 1.3 million primarily relates to changes in the carrying value of
forward purchase contracts and commodity futures positions recorded at fair value. An increase in the balance of refundable income
taxes of approximately 1.5 million primarily relates to overpayment of taxes currently payable for the previous fiscal year and
quarterly estimated tax payments. While the Company has tax credits available to offset all amounts owed, the Company is limited
to using tax credits for only 75 of federal taxes owed. A decrease in the balance of accounts payable used cash of approximately
 5.6 million, which was primarily a result of the timing of inventory receipts and vendor payments. A decrease in the balance of
other liabilities used cash of approximately 4.8 million. 

At October 31, 2024, working capital was
approximately 392.5 million, compared to 385.8 million at January 31, 2024. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities
was 9.9 to 1 at October 31, 2024 and 6.8 to 1 at January 31, 2024. 

Cash of approximately 37.6 million was provided
by investing activities for the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, compared to cash used in investing activities of approximately
 63.3 million during the first nine months of fiscal year 2023. During the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, the Company had
capital expenditures of approximately 55.4 million, primarily for various capital projects at our consolidated ethanol plants,
including 24.5 million for expansion and CI scoring reduction projects at the One Earth facility and 22.4 million for the carbon
sequestration project. During the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, we purchased short-term U.S. Treasury Bills of approximately
 210.3 million, while U.S. Treasury Bills of approximately 303.0 million matured. The U.S Treasury Bills had maturities of less
than one year and we classified them as short-term investments. Depending on the investment options available, we may elect to
retain the funds, or a portion thereof, in cash, short-term investments or long-term investments. 

Cash of approximately 63.3 million was used
in investing activities for the first nine months of fiscal year 2023. During the first nine months of fiscal year 2023, we had
capital expenditures of approximately 22.4 million, primarily for various capital projects at our consolidated ethanol plants,
including 7.7 million for expansion and CI scoring reduction projects at the One Earth facility and 8.0 million for the carbon
sequestration project. During the first nine months of fiscal year 2023, we purchased U.S. Treasury Bills of approximately 378.4
million. During the first nine months of fiscal year 2023 U.S. Treasury Bills of approximately 337.5 million matured. The U.S
Treasury Bills had maturities of less than one year and we classified them as short-term investments. 

33 

Cash of approximately
 1.9 million was used in financing activities for the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 for payments to noncontrolling interests
holders, compared to approximately 0.7 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2023. 

We are investigating
various uses for our excess cash and short-term investments. We expect total capital expenditures related to the construction at
the One Earth facilities to approximate 165 million to 175 million, inclusive of the carbon sequestration project and plant capacity
expansion and ongoing efforts to reduce CI scoring, which we currently plan to pay from our available cash. As of October 31, 2024,
we have spent 52.9 million since inception and are contractually committed to spend an additional 2.4 million toward the carbon
sequestration project. As of October 31, 2024, we have spent 50.2 million since inception and are contractually committed to spend
an additional 7.4 million toward plant capacity expansion and CI scoring reduction efforts. For all projects, we plan to spend
 25 million to 35 million during the remainder of fiscal year 2024. 

We have a stock buyback
program with 876,786 shares remaining authorized at October 31, 2024. We typically repurchase our common stock when our stock price
is trading at a price we deem to be a discount to the underlying value of our net assets. We continue to seek investment opportunities,
including ethanol and/or energy related, carbon sequestration related, agricultural or other ventures, we believe meet our investment
criteria. 

Forward-Looking Statements

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk 

We are exposed to the impact of market
fluctuations associated with commodity prices as discussed below. 

We manage a portion of our risk with respect
to the volatility of commodity prices inherent in the ethanol industry by using forward fixed-price purchase and fixed-price sale
contracts and exchange traded commodity futures contracts. Our remaining exposure to market risk, which includes the impact of
our risk management activities resulting from our fixed-price purchase and sale contracts and derivatives, is based on the estimated
effect on pre-tax income for the twelve months following October 31, 2024 is as follows, assuming normal operating capacity (amounts
in thousands):
