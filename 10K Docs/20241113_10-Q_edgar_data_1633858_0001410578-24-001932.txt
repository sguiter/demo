 parts, as follows: the first part of the Incentive Fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus the Company s operating expenses accrued for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement (as defined below) and any interest expense on any credit facilities or outstanding debt and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the Incentive Fee). The Company determines pre-incentive fee net investment income in accordance with GAAP, including, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature, such as debt instruments with PIK interest, OID securities and accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, computed net of all realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Company s net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to a hurdle of per quarter annualized). The Company determines its average gross assets during each fiscal quarter and calculates the base management fee payable with respect to such amount at the end of each fiscal quarter. As a result, a portion of the Company s net investment income is included in its gross assets for the period between the date on which such income is earned and the date on which such income is distributed. Therefore, the Company s net investment income used to calculate part of the Incentive Fee is also included in the amount of the Company s gross assets used to calculate the annual base management fee. The Company pays its Adviser an Incentive Fee with respect to its pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows: amount is paid on the income-portion of the Incentive Fee in any calendar quarter in which the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle of annualized); of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than in any calendar quarter annualized). The Company refers to this portion of its pre-incentive fee net investment income (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than as the catch-up provision. The catch-up is meant to provide the Adviser with of the pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate did not apply if net investment income exceeds in any calendar quarter annualized); and of the amount of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds in any calendar quarter annualized) is payable to the Adviser. 
 Pursuant to the Waiver Agreement, the Adviser has agreed to waive its right to receive the Incentive Fee on pre-incentive fee net investment income to the extent necessary so that such Incentive Fee equals, and is calculated in the same manner as, the corresponding Incentive Fee on pre-incentive fee net investment income, if such Incentive Fee (i) were calculated based upon the Adviser receiving (instead of of the applicable pre-incentive fee net investment income and (ii) did not include any catch-up feature in favor of the Adviser. The second part of the Incentive Fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), and equals of the Company s realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from June 16, 2015, the effective date of the Company s registration statement on Form 10 (file no. 000-55426), through the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain Incentive Fees with respect to each of the investments in the Company s portfolio. Pursuant to the Waiver Agreement, the Adviser has agreed to waive the right to receive the Incentive Fee on capital gains to the extent necessary so that such portion of the Incentive Fee equals, and is calculated in the same manner as, the corresponding Incentive Fee on capital gains, if such portion of the Incentive Fee were calculated based upon the Adviser receiving (instead of ).

 in any calendar quarter. The waivers from the Adviser will remain effective until terminated earlier by either party upon prior written notice. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, we do not pay any Capital Gains Incentive Fee in respect of unrealized capital appreciation in our portfolio. However, under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, we are required to accrue for the Capital Gain Incentive Fee on a quarterly basis as if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized in full at the end of each period. If the Capital Gain Incentive Fee Base, adjusted as required by GAAP to include unrealized appreciation, is positive at the end of a period, then GAAP and the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement require us to accrue a capital gain incentive fee equal to of such amount, less the aggregate amount of actual capital gain incentive fees paid or capital gain incentive fees accrued under GAAP in all prior periods. If such amount is negative, then there is no accrual for such period. The resulting accrual under GAAP for a capital gain incentive fee payable in any period will result in additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period, or in a reversal of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than in the prior period. We can offer no assurance that any unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded incentive fees related to net investment income of and , respectively. Offsetting the incentive fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were waivers of the incentive fees of and , respectively, as set forth within the accompanying statements of operations.

Offsetting the incentive fees were waivers of the incentive fees of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, as set forth within the accompanying statements of operations. Administration Agreement and Administrative Fee The Company has also entered into an administration agreement (the Administration Agreement with Audax Management Company, LLC (the Administrator pursuant to which the Administrator provides administrative services to the Company. Under the Administration Agreement, the Administrator performs, or oversees the performance of administrative services necessary for the operation of the Company, which include being responsible for the financial records which the Company is required to maintain and prepare reports filed with the SEC. In addition, the Administrator assists in determining and publishing the Company s net asset value, oversees the preparation and filing of the Company s tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to the Company s stockholders, and generally oversees the payment of the Company s expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to the Company by others. The Company reimburses the Administrator for its allocable portion of the costs and expenses incurred by the Administrator for overhead in performance by the Administrator of its duties under the Administration Agreement, including the cost of facilities, office equipment and the Company s allocable portion of cost of compensation and related expenses of its Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and their respective staffs, as well as any costs and expenses incurred by the Administrator relating to any administrative or operating services provided by the Administrator to the Company. Such costs are reflected as an administrative fee in the accompanying statements of operations.

 of the sum of its net ordinary income and net short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses, if any (i.e., investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid), for each taxable year. The amount to be paid out as distributions to the Company s stockholders is determined by the Board of Directors and is based on management s estimate of the fiscal year earnings. Based on that estimate, the Company intends to make the requisite distributions to its stockholders, which will generally relieve the Company from corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes. Although the Company currently intends to distribute its net capital gains (i.e., net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses), if any, recognized in respect of each taxable year as dividends out of the Company s assets legally available for distribution, the Company in the future may decide to retain for investment and be subject to entity-level income tax on such net capital gains. Additionally, depending on the level of taxable income earned in a taxable year, the Company may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year distributions into the next taxable year and incur a excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that the Company determines that its estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year distributions, the Company will accrue an excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as such excess taxable income is earned. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company executed a total of in Tender Offers that resulted in differing GAAP vs. tax treatment of proceeds distributed.

 OVERVIEW Audax Credit BDC Inc. is a Delaware corporation that was formed on January 29, 2015. We are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, we have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. Our investment objective is to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. We intend to meet our investment objective by investing primarily in senior secured debt of privately owned U.S. middle market companies. We intend to invest at least 80 of our net assets plus the amount of any borrowings in credit instruments, which we define as any fixed income instruments. Although we have no present intention of doing so, we may decide to incur leverage. If we do incur leverage, we anticipate that it will be used in limited circumstances and on a short-term basis for purposes such as funding distributions. As a BDC, we are limited in our use of leverage under the 1940 Act. Under the 1940 Act, a BDC generally is required to maintain asset coverage of 200 for senior securities representing indebtedness (such as borrowings from banks or other financial institutions) or stock (such as preferred stock). The Small Business Credit Availability Act (the SBCAA ), which was signed into law on March 23, 2018, provides that a BDC s required asset coverage under the 1940 Act may be reduced from 200 (i.e., 1 of debt outstanding for each 1 of equity) to 150 (i.e., 2 of debt outstanding for each 1 of equity). This reduction in asset coverage permits a BDC to double the amount of leverage it may utilize, subject to certain approval, timing and reporting requirements, including either stockholder approval or approval of a majority of the directors who are not interested persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the BDC and who have no financial interest in the arrangement. In addition, as a non-traded BDC, if we receive the relevant approval to increase our authorized leverage, we will be required to offer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their shares of Common Stock over the next year following the calendar quarter in which the approval was obtained. In determining whether to use leverage, we would analyze the maturity, covenants and interest rate structure of the proposed borrowings, as well as the risks of such borrowings within the context of our investment outlook and the impact of leverage on our investment portfolio. The amount of any leverage that we will employ as a BDC will be subject to oversight by our Board of Directors. We generate revenue in the form of interest on the debt securities that we hold in our portfolio companies. The senior debt we invest in generally has stated terms of three to ten years. Our senior debt investments generally bear interest at a floating rate. Interest on debt securities is generally payable quarterly or semiannually. In some cases, some of our investments may provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest generally will become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment and other fees in connection with transactions, although we do not expect to do so. OID as well as market discount and premium are accreted and amortized in determining our interest income. We record any prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as income. PORTFOLIO COMPOSITION AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY Portfolio Composition The fair value of our investments, comprised of syndicated loans and equity, as of September 30, 2024, was approximately 395,592,598 and held in 232 portfolio companies as of September 30, 2024.

The increase in base management fees before waivers for the three months ended September 30, 2024 in comparison to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was driven by our increasing average gross assets balance.

The decrease in incentive fees before waivers for the three months ended September 30, 2024 in comparison to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was driven by our decrease in net investment income. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we accrued incentive fees related to net investment income before waivers of 1,465,399 and 1,487,402, respectively.

The increase in incentive fees before waivers for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 in comparison to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was driven by our increase in net investment income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we accrued incentive fees related to net investment income before waivers of 4,315,250 and 4,234,793, respectively. Offsetting those fees, we recognized incentive fee waivers of 2,694,707 and 2,671,096, respectively. Additionally, we accrued 66,250 and 198,750 of administrative fees for each of the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Refer to Note 4 Related Party Transactions in the notes accompanying our financial statements for more information related to base management fees, incentive fees and waivers. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred professional fees of 147,656 and 503,583, respectively, related to audit fees, tax fees, and legal fees. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred professional fees of 190,921 and 402,827, respectively, related to audit fees, tax fees, and legal fees. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred expenses related to fees paid to our independent directors of 69,000 and 216,000, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred expenses related to fees paid to our independent directors of 63,750 and 191,250, respectively.

Net change in unrealized appreciation on investments during the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the change in the results and financial position of the portfolio companies. Net change in unrealized depreciation on investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the change in the results and financial position of the portfolio companies. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We generate cash primarily from the net proceeds of any offering of shares of our Common Stock, from cash flows from interest and fees earned from our investments, and from principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. Our primary use of cash is investments in portfolio companies, payments of our expenses, cash distributions to our stockholders, and repurchases of common stock from our stockholders. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash of 21,068,881 and 20,940,279, respectively. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 19,835,485. The primary operating activities during this period were investments in portfolio companies. The Company invested 67,864,094 in new portfolio investments and 23,671,676 in existing portfolio investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This was offset by repayments of bank loans and sales of investments of 65,130,510 and 15,229,825, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 61,718,423. The primary operating activities during this period were investments in portfolio companies. The Company invested 32,885,316 in new portfolio investments and 9,522,941 in existing portfolio investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was offset by repayments of bank loans and sales of investments of 37,397,666 and 34,263,233, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had 106 investments with unfunded commitments of 41,769,864. As of December 31, 2023, we had 84 investments with unfunded commitments of 27,258,654. We believe that, as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had sufficient assets to adequately cover any obligations under our unfunded commitments.

Net cash used in our financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 48,389,492, which consisted of 30,000,000 in issuances of 3,267,974 shares to our stockholders, 47,515,735 in repurchases of 5,125,458 shares to our stockholders in connection with the Tender Offer during the period, 13,178,611 in connection with repayments of our short-term borrowings during the period, and 17,695,146 of distributions paid to our common stockholders during the period. Equity Activity An investor made capital commitments to us in the amounts set forth below as of the date opposite each capital commitment: 

Amount Date 140,000,000 June 23, 2015 50,000,000 December 2, 2016 100,000,000 On December 7, 2017 40,000,000 March 22, 2019 30,000,000 September 23, 2019 11,200,000 March 20, 2020 8,900,000 May 28, 2021 110,000,000 December 15, 2021 30,000,000 June 13, 2023 37,000,000 May 25, 2024 As of September 30, 2024, there were no unfunded capital commitments by the Company s investors. The number of shares of our Common Stock issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, were 45,266,064 and 44,518,989, respectively. Distributions to Stockholders Common Stock Distributions We have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a RIC, we generally are not subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders. To qualify to be taxed as a RIC and thus avoid corporate-level income tax on the income that we distribute as dividends to our stockholders, we are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders each taxable year generally of an amount at least equal to 90 of our investment company taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for any dividends paid. To avoid a 4 excise tax on undistributed earnings, we are required to 

 56 

Table of Contents 
 distribute dividends to our stockholders in respect of each calendar year of an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) 98 of our ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for such calendar year, (ii) 98.2 of our capital gain net income, adjusted for certain ordinary losses, for the one-year period ending October 31 of that calendar year and (iii) any income or capital gains recognized, but not distributed, in preceding calendar years and on which we incurred no federal income tax. We intend to make distributions to stockholders on an annual basis of substantially all of our net investment income. Although we intend to make distributions of net realized capital gains, if any, at least annually, out of assets legally available for such distributions, we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment. In addition, the extent and timing of special dividends, if any, will be determined by our Board of Directors and will largely be driven by portfolio specific events and tax considerations. We may fund our cash distributions from any sources of funds available, including offering proceeds, borrowings, net investment income from operations, capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, non-capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, dividends or other distributions paid to us on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies and fee waivers from our Adviser. Our distributions may exceed our earnings, especially during the period before we have substantially invested the proceeds from an offering. As a result, a portion of the distributions may represent a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, the source of a distribution to our stockholders may be the original capital invested by the stockholder rather than our income or gains. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings applicable to us as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We declared distributions of 26,706,974, or 0.580 per share during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. We declared distributions of 17,695,204, or 0.410 per share during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The determination of the tax attributes of the Company s distributions, including distributions in connection with tender offers, are made annually at the end of the Company s taxable year, based upon the Company s taxable income for the full taxable year and distributions paid for the full taxable year. Therefore, a determination made on an interim basis may not be representative of the actual tax attributes of distributions for a full taxable year. The actual tax characteristics of distributions to stockholders will be reported to the Company s stockholders subject to information reporting after the close of the calendar year. Related Party Fees For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded base management fees of 1,061,088 and 1,022,684, respectively. Offsetting these fees were waivers to the base management fees of 371,381 and 357,939, respectively, as set forth within the accompanying statements of operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded base management fees of 3,158,434 and 3,215,515, respectively. Offsetting these fees were waivers to the base management fees of 1,105,452 and 1,125,430, respectively, as set forth within the accompanying statements of operations. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded incentive fees of 1,465,399 and 1,487,402, respectively. Offsetting these waivers to the incentive fees of 902,083 and 893,033, respectively, as set forth within the accompanying statements of operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded incentive fees of 4,315,250 and 4,234,793, respectively.

 Tender Offers To provide our stockholders with limited liquidity, we may, in the absolute discretion of our Board of Directors, conduct tender offers. Our tenders for shares of Common Stock, if any, are conducted on such terms as may be determined by our Board of Directors and in accordance with the requirements of applicable law, including Section 23(c) of the 1940 Act and Regulation M under the Exchange Act. On April 10, 2024, the Company issued a Tender Offer to repurchase 30.0 million worth of Common Stock from the Stockholder. The Offer was accepted in full on May 10, 2024. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES This discussion of our operations is based upon our financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. In addition to the discussion below, we describe our critical accounting policies in the notes to our financial statements. Valuation of Investments On December 3, 2020, the SEC announced that it adopted the Valuation Rule, which established an updated regulatory framework for determining fair value in good faith for purposes of the 1940 Act. Pursuant to the Valuation Rule, which became effective on September 8, 2022, our Board of Directors designated the Adviser as our Valuation Designee to perform fair value determinations relating to the value of our assets for which market quotations are not readily available in good faith. Such valuation by the Valuation Designee must be made in good faith and may be based on, among other things, the input of independent third-party valuation firms, where applicable. The Valuation Designee s valuation process is subject to our Board of Directors oversight. In accordance with the 1940 Act, our Board of Directors has the ultimate responsibility for reviewing the good faith fair value determination of our investments for which market quotations are not readily available based on our Policy and for overseeing the Valuation Designee. Such review and oversight include receiving written fair value determinations and supporting materials provided by the Valuation Designee and any independent third-party valuation firms as may be used by the Valuation Designee or our Board of Directors from time to time. As part of the valuation process, the Valuation Designee may take into account the following types of factors, if relevant, in determining the fair value of our investments: applicable market yields and multiples; security covenants; call protection provisions; information rights; comparisons of financial ratios of the portfolio companies that issued such private equity securities to peer companies that are public; comparable merger and acquisition transactions; the nature and realizable value of any collateral; the portfolio company s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow; available current market data, including relevant and applicable markets in which the portfolio company does business; and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the Valuation Designee will consider the pricing indicated by the external event in its valuation of the portfolio investment. The Valuation Designee utilizes the following multi-step process in determining fair value for our investments for which market quotations are not readily available : The Adviser s investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment and other senior members of the Adviser s investment and management team, with oversight from the Adviser s finance team, will make initial valuations of each investment; The Adviser s investment professionals and management team, with oversight by the Adviser s finance and compliance team, will document the preliminary valuation conclusions and oversee sample testing of valuations with third-party valuation agents; 

 58 

Table of Contents 
 The preliminary valuation conclusions will be presented to the valuation committees for consideration; The valuation committees will discuss the recommended valuations and determine, in good faith, the fair value of each investment; The valuation determinations of the valuation committees will be presented to the risk committee and then shared with our CEO and CFO; and The Adviser will provide certain quarterly and annual reports to our Board of Directors. 
 Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different from the valuations currently assigned. The Valuation Designee determines fair value in good faith for all our investments without readily available market quotations by using methodologies consistent with the principles of the valuation approaches set forth in ASC 820, Section 2(a)(41) of the 1940 Act and Rule 2a-5 thereunder. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. For some assets and liabilities, observable market transactions or market information might be available. For other assets and liabilities, observable market transactions and market information might not be available. However, the objective of a fair value measurement in both cases is the same to estimate the price when an orderly transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions (that is, an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability). ASC 820 establishes a hierarchal disclosure framework which ranks the observability of inputs used in measuring financial instruments at fair value. The observability of inputs is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of financial instruments and their specific characteristics. Financial instruments with readily available quoted prices, or for which fair value can be measured from quoted prices in active markets, generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment applied in determining fair value. The three-level hierarchy for fair value measurement is defined as follows: Level 1 Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices available in active markets for identical financial instruments as of the measurement date. The types of financial instruments in this category include unrestricted securities, including equities and derivatives, listed in active markets. We do not adjust the quoted price for these instruments, even in situations where we hold a large position, and a sale could reasonably be expected to impact the quoted price. Level 2 Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date. The types of financial instruments in this category include less liquid and restricted securities listed in active markets, securities traded in markets that are not active, government and agency securities, and certain over-the-counter derivatives where the fair value is based on observable inputs. Level 3 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the investment. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. The types of financial instruments in this category include investments in privately held entities, non-investment grade residual interests in securitizations, collateralized loan obligations, and certain over-the-counter derivatives where the fair value is based on unobservable inputs. 

 59 

Table of Contents 
 In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the determination of which category within the fair value hierarchy is appropriate for any given financial instrument is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. Pursuant to the framework set forth above, the Valuation Designee values securities traded in active markets on the measurement date by multiplying the exchange closing price of such traded securities/instruments by the quantity of shares or amount of the instrument held. The Valuation Designee may also obtain quotes with respect to certain of our investments from pricing services, brokers or dealers quotes, or counterparty marks in order to value liquid assets that are not traded in active markets. Pricing services aggregate, evaluate and report pricing from a variety of sources including observed trades of identical or similar securities, broker or dealer quotes, model-based valuations and internal fundamental analysis and research. When doing so, the Valuation Designee determines whether the quote obtained is sufficient in accordance with GAAP to determine the fair value of the security. If determined adequate, the Valuation Designee uses the quote obtained. Securities that are illiquid or for which the pricing source does not provide a valuation or methodology or provides a valuation or methodology that, in the judgment of the Valuation Designee, does not represent fair value, are each valued as of the measurement date using all techniques appropriate under the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available. These valuation techniques vary by investment but include comparable public market valuations, comparable precedent transaction valuations and discounted cash flow analyses. Inputs for these valuation techniques include relative credit information, observed market movement, industry sector information, and other market data, which may include benchmarking of comparable securities, issuer spreads, reported trades, and reference data, such as market research publications, when available. Investment performance data utilized are the most recently available as of the measurement date, which in many cases may reflect up to a one quarter lag in information. Securities for which market quotations are not readily available or for which a pricing source is not sufficient may include the following: private placements and restricted securities that do not have an active trading market; securities whose trading has been suspended or for which market quotes are no longer available; debt securities that have recently gone into default and for which there is no current market; securities whose prices are stale; and securities affected by significant events. 
 Subject to the oversight of our Board of Directors, the Valuation Designee has the overall responsibility for the implementation and monitoring of our pricing policies to ensure fair, accurate and current valuations. Determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on our financial statements. Security transactions are recorded on the trade date (the date the order to buy or sell is executed or, in the case of privately issued securities, the closing date, which is when all terms of the transactions have been defined). Realized gains and losses on investments are determined based on the identified cost method. Realized gains and losses on investments are determined based on the identified cost method. Refer to Note 3 Investments in the notes to our accompanying financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information regarding fair value measurements and our application of ASC 820.

 Revenue Recognition We record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. For loans and debt securities with contractual PIK interest, which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the principal balance, we generally will not accrue PIK interest for accounting purposes if the portfolio company valuation indicates that such PIK interest is not collectible. We do not accrue as a receivable interest on loans and debt securities for accounting purposes if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. OID, market discounts or premiums are accreted or amortized using the effective interest method as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income. Net Realized Gains or Losses and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation We measure net realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, but considering unamortized upfront fees and prepayment penalties. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation, when gains or losses are realized. PIK Interest We may have investments in our portfolio that contain a PIK interest provision. Any PIK interest will be added to the principal balance of such investments and is recorded as income if the portfolio company valuation indicates that such PIK interest is collectible. In order to maintain our status as a RIC, substantially all of this income must be included in the amounts paid out by us to stockholders in the form of distributions, even if we have not collected any cash. U.S. Income Taxes We have elected to be subject to tax as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not have to incur any corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute as dividends to our stockholders. To qualify and maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements as well as distribute dividends to our stockholders each taxable year of an amount generally at least equal to 90 of our investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any distributions paid. Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a taxable year, we may choose to retain taxable income in excess of current year distributions into the next taxable year. We would then incur a 4 excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income may exceed estimated current year distributions, we will accrue an excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned. We did not accrue any excise tax for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021. Because U.S. federal income tax regulations differ from GAAP, distributions in accordance with tax regulations may differ from net investment income and realized gains recognized for financial reporting purposes. Differences may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified within capital accounts in the financial statements to reflect their tax character. Permanent differences may also result from differences in classification in certain items, such as the treatment of short-term gains as ordinary income for tax purposes. Temporary differences arise when certain items of income, expense, gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future. We evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our financial statements to determine whether any relevant tax positions would more-likely-than-not be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are reversed and recorded as a tax benefit or expensed in the current fiscal year. All penalties and interest associated with any income taxes accrued are included in income tax expense. Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, ongoing analyses of tax law, regulations and interpretations thereof. Our accounting policy on income taxes is critical because if we are unable to qualify, or once qualified, maintain our tax status as a RIC, we would be required to record a provision for corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes, as well as any related state or local taxes which may be significant to our financial results.

 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES From time to time, we, or the Adviser, may become party to legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings related to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. Neither we nor the Adviser is currently subject to any material legal proceedings. Unfunded commitments to provide funds to portfolio companies are not reflected in our accompanying statements of assets and liabilities. Our unfunded commitments may be significant from time to time. These commitments are subject to the same underwriting and ongoing portfolio maintenance as are the on-balance sheet financial instruments that we hold. Since these commitments may expire without being drawn, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We use cash flow from normal and early principal repayments and proceeds from borrowings and offerings to fund these commitments. As of September 30, 2024, we had 106 investments with unfunded commitments of 41,769,864. As of December 31, 2023, we had 84 investments with unfunded commitments of 27,258,654. We believe that, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had sufficient assets to adequately cover any obligations under our unfunded commitments.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. During the period covered by our financial statements, many of the loans in our portfolio had floating interest rates, and we expect that many of our loans to portfolio companies in the future will also have floating interest rates based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) or an equivalent risk-free index rate. Interest rate fluctuations may have a substantial negative impact on our investments, the value of our Common Stock and our rate of return on invested capital. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 

Increase (decrease) in Change in interest rates investment income Up 300 basis points 12,051,028 Up 200 basis points 8,034,019 Up 100 basis points 4,017,009 Down 100 basis points (4,017,009) Down 200 basis points (8,034,019) Down 300 basis points (12,051,028) Although we believe that this measure is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not reflect potential changes in the credit market, credit quality, size and composition of the assets on the Statements of Assets and Liabilities and other business developments that could affect our net increase in net assets resulting from operations or net investment income. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from those shown above. In addition, any investments we make that are denominated in a foreign currency will be subject to risks associated with changes in currency exchange rates. These risks include the possibility of significant fluctuations in the foreign currency markets, the imposition or modification of foreign exchange controls and potential illiquidity in the secondary market. These risks will vary depending upon the currency or currencies involved. We may hedge against interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments with fixed interest rates. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the period covered by this report, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness and design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level in timely alerting management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of material information about us required to be included in periodic SEC filings. However, in evaluation of the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Exhibit 99.1 AUDAX MANAGEMENT COMPANY, LLC AUDAX MANAGEMENT COMPANY (NY), LLC AUDAX CREDIT BDC INC. JOINT CODE OF ETHICS This is the Joint Code of Ethics (the Code of Audax Management Company, LLC and Audax Management Company (NY), LLC (together, the Firm and Audax Credit BDC Inc. Audax BDC (the Firm and Audax BDC referred to collectively as the Group Companies ). The Code is intended to satisfy the code of ethics requirements of Rule 204A-1 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act and Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ). WHO IS SUBJECT TO THE CODE? The Code applies in its entirety to the following persons: Every officer or employee of the Firm. Every Access Person (i.e., every natural person (whether or not an employee of the Firm) who is subject to the Firm s supervision and control who (i) has access to nonpublic information regarding an Advised Vehicle s purchase or sale of securities, (ii) who is involved in making securities or investment recommendations to an Advised Vehicle, or (iii) who has access to securities recommendations to an Advised Vehicle that are nonpublic). For the avoidance of doubt, summer interns placed at an Audax Private Equity portfolio company are not considered Access Persons and are not subject to the Code. The directors of Audax BDC. This Code applies to the Independent Directors of Audax BDC unless otherwise stated. 
 THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW TO USE THE CODE 1. Terms in boldface type have special meanings as used in the Code. To understand the Code, you need to read the definitions of these terms. The definitions are at the end of the Code. 2. There are certain Reporting Forms that persons covered by the Code have to complete. Please submit the Reporting Forms electronically through the Audax Compliance Website (currently ComplySci). Independent Directors of Audax BDC are not required to complete or submit Reporting Forms. 3. The Chief Compliance Officer has the authority to grant written waivers of the provisions of the Code in appropriate instances. However: The Firm expects that waivers will be granted only in rare instances; and Some provisions of the Code that are prescribed by Securities and Exchange Commission SEC rules cannot be waived. These provisions include, but are not limited to, the requirements that covered persons file certain reports and obtain preclearance of certain transactions. 

4. The management of the Group Companies and the Chief Compliance Officer will review the terms and provisions of the Code at least annually and make amendments as necessary. The Chief Compliance Officer must provide a copy of the Code, and a copy of any amendment to the Code, to each person covered by the Code. Such copies will be provided electronically through the Audax Compliance Website. 5. You must familiarize yourself with the Code and acknowledge your receipt of the Code (and any amendment thereto) by completing an Acknowledgment (in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A through the Audax Compliance Website. Independent Directors of Audax BDC are not required to complete an Acknowledgment. GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND RESTRICTIONS General Principles It is generally improper for the Firm or persons covered by the Code to: use for their own benefit (or the benefit of anyone other than an Advised Vehicle) information about the Firm s trading or investment recommendations for an Advised Vehicle; take advantage of investment opportunities that would otherwise be available for an Advised Vehicle; or take advantage of business opportunities (including opportunities for personal investment) by using the Firm s reputation or goodwill for personal gain in an inappropriate manner. 
 The Group Companies expect all persons covered by the Code to comply with the spirit of the Code, as well as the specific rules contained in the Code. The Group Companies treat violations of the Code (including violations of the spirit of the Code) seriously. If you violate either the letter or the spirit of the Code, the Group Companies may take disciplinary measures against you, including, without limitation, imposing penalties or fines, reducing your compensation, demoting you, requiring unwinding of any applicable trade, requiring disgorgement of trading gains, suspending or terminating your employment or any combination of the foregoing. Improper trading activity can constitute a violation of the Code. But you can also violate the Code by failing to file required reports, or by making inaccurate or misleading reports or statements concerning trading activity or securities accounts. Your conduct can violate the Code even if neither any Advised Vehicle nor the Firm is harmed by your conduct. You and any member of your Family/Household may be required to divest existing investments (including investments in private, commingled funds) in the event those investments give rise to conflicts of interest or otherwise violate the letter or spirit of the Code. If you have any doubt or uncertainty about what the Code requires or permits, you should ask the Chief Compliance Officer . Please do not guess at the answer. Any violations of the Code must be reported promptly to the Chief Compliance Officer . Compliance with the Federal Securities Laws. All persons covered by the Code must comply with applicable U.S. federal securities laws at all times. TRANSACTION RESTRICTIONS 1. Preclearance . You and members of your Family/Household are prohibited from engaging in any transaction in a Covered Security for any account in which you or a member of your 

Family/Household has any Beneficial Ownership unless you obtain, in advance of the transaction, preclearance for that transaction. For purposes of these preclearance requirements, you should assume that any investment transaction that you or members of your Family/Household are considering making is subject to preclearance pursuant to the Code, unless the Code specifically provides that the transaction is not subject to preclearance. Independent Directors of Audax BDC, and members of their Family/Household , are not required to obtain preclearance for a transaction in a Covered Security for any account in which they or a member of their Family/Household has any Beneficial Ownership . Preclearance is obtained by first completing and submitting a Preclearance Form electronically through the Audax Compliance Website. If preclearance is obtained, the approval is valid for five (5) business days, including the day on which it is granted (except in the case of private placements, as discussed below under Private Placements ). The Chief Compliance Officer may revoke a preclearance at any time after it is granted and before you execute the transaction. The Chief Compliance Officer may deny or revoke preclearance for any reason and is not required to explain such revocation or denial to you. The preclearance requirements do not apply to the following categories of transactions: Transactions in Covered Securities issued or guaranteed by any state, local, or national government that is a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or any agency or authority thereof. Transactions that occur by operation of law or under any other circumstance in which neither you nor any member of your Family/Household exercises any discretion to buy or to sell or makes recommendations to a person who exercises such discretion. Purchases of Covered Securities pursuant to an automatic investment plan. An automatic investment plan means a program in which regular periodic purchases (or withdrawals) are made automatically in (or from) investment accounts in accordance with a predetermined schedule and allocation. An automatic investment plan includes a dividend reinvestment plan. Purchases pursuant to the exercise of rights issued pro rata to all holders of any class of Covered Securities and received by you (or a Family/Household member) from the issuer. Shares of open-end investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (i.e., mutual funds). Transactions in shares of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Derivatives (such as options or futures contracts) where preclearance is not required for the underlying asset pursuant to this policy (e.g., options on a currency, ETF, or index). 
 NOTE: Any investment in a Covered Security of any Advised Vehicle portfolio company is subject to preclearance. While transactions in shares of mutual funds are not subject to preclearance (because they are not Covered Securities ), shares of publicly traded business development companies (BDCs) are subject to preclearance. 2. Private Placements . Neither you nor any member of your Family/Household may acquire any Beneficial Ownership in any security (not just Covered Securities in a private placement, including the purchase of a direct interest in any Advised Vehicle , except with the specific, advance written approval of the Chief Compliance 

Officer (which may be provided electronically). The Chief Compliance Officer , following consultation with the Chief Legal Officer or, in the Chief Legal Officer s absence, another executive officer of the Firm (either the Chief Operating Officer or a Co-CEO), may deny requests to acquire securities in a private placement due to a perceived or actual conflict of interest (including, but not limited to, prospective business relationships or corporate opportunities) or for any other reason. Independent Directors of Audax BDC, and members of their Family/Household , are not required to obtain preclearance to acquire Beneficial Ownership of any security by means of a private placement. If preclearance is granted, it is valid until the applicable private placement transaction closes, unless the nature of the investment, or representations made in the preclearance request, change materially. Investments in Private Advised Vehicles, Portfolio Companies and Similar Entities Particularly since the Firm is a diversified alternative asset manager offering multiple products and investment vehicles, investments by Firm employees in private, commingled funds and similar vehicles managed by others (or related portfolio companies) may raise heightened conflicts of interest and similar concerns. Given this context: Requests to invest in private equity, mezzanine debt, unitranche debt, senior debt and other private, commingled funds following strategies similar to those of the Advised Vehicles (or the Advised Vehicles portfolio companies) generally will not be approved, except in circumstances where the Firm determines that there is not a material conflict of interest, or potential conflict of interest between the desired investment and the applicable Advised Vehicle and the Advised Vehicle s portfolio companies. Similar guidelines will apply to requests to invest in private companies (including portfolio companies of prohibited funds). Requests to invest in other types of private, commingled funds (and related private companies) may be approved on a case-by-case basis, subject to the Firm confirming that (i) the requesting party will have no influence over, or prior knowledge of, investment or governance decisions of the applicable fund/company and (ii) other factors do not indicate the request should be denied. In most cases, these requests are expected to be approved principally for funds or companies following strategies dissimilar to those of the Advised Vehicles and the Advised Vehicles portfolio companies (e.g., real estate (including core, opportunistic and mortgage credit), venture capital, equity hedge and fund-of-funds strategies). The preceding guidelines will not apply to investments in the Advised Vehicles in accordance with Firm procedure. Also, these guidelines do not constitute an exhaustive list of rules governing preclearance requests for private investments. Each preclearance request is considered based upon the applicable facts at the time of the request and other relevant factors. 
 3. Initial Public Offerings . Neither you nor any member of your Family/Household may acquire any Beneficial Ownership in any security (not just Covered Securities in an initial public offering, except with the specific, advance written approval of the Chief Compliance Officer (which may be provided electronically), which the Chief Compliance Officer may deny for any reason. Independent Directors of Audax BDC, and members of their Family/Household , are not required to obtain advance written approval of the Chief Compliance Officer to acquire Beneficial Ownership of any security by means of an initial public offering. 

REPORTING Reporting Requirements NOTE: One of the most complicated parts of complying with the Code is understanding what holdings, transactions and accounts you must report and what accounts are subject to trading restrictions. For example, accounts of certain members of your family and household are covered, as are certain categories of trust accounts, certain investment pools in which you might participate, and certain accounts that others may be managing for you. To be sure you understand what holdings, transactions and accounts are covered, it is essential that you carefully review the definitions of Covered Security , Family/Household and Beneficial Ownership in the Definitions section at the end of the Code. Compliance with the following reporting requirements does not relieve you of any of your other obligations under the Code, including the requirement that you seek preclearance of transactions in Covered Securities . Reporting forms must generally be completed and submitted electronically through the Audax Compliance Website. The Chief Compliance Officer or a designee shall have the responsibility of periodically reviewing personal securities transactions and holdings. Initial Holdings Reports . No later than 10 calendar days after you joined the Firm or otherwise became covered by the Code, you must submit an Initial Holdings Report (containing information substantively similar to that set forth in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B via the Audax Compliance Website. The Initial Holdings Report requires you to list all Covered Securities (including identifying information related to the security and the number of shares and/or principal amount) in which you (or members of your Family/Household have Beneficial Ownership . It also requires you to confirm that you have listed all brokers, dealers and banks with which you or a member of your Family/Household maintained an account in which any securities (not just Covered Securities were held for the direct or indirect benefit of you or a member of your Family/Household on the date you joined the Firm or became a person otherwise covered by the Code. The information contained in the Initial Holdings Report must be current as of a date no more than 45 days prior to the date you joined the Firm or became a person otherwise covered by the Code. The Initial Holdings Report also requires you to confirm that you have read and understand the Code and that you understand that it applies to you and to members of your Family/Household . Independent Directors of Audax BDC are not required to submit an Initial Holdings Report. Duplicate Confirmation Statements and Account Statements . If you or any member of your Family/Household has a securities account that contains one or more Covered Securities (or has Beneficial Ownership of Covered Securities in another person s account) with any broker, dealer or bank, you or your Family/Household member are requested to direct that broker, dealer or bank to send, directly to the Chief Compliance Officer through the Audax Compliance Website, contemporaneous copies (in electronic form) of all transaction confirmation statements and account statements relating to that account. Any confirmation statements must include, for each transaction, the date of the transaction, the title and type of security and, as applicable, the exchange ticker symbol or CUSIP number, interest rate and maturity date, the number of shares and principal amount of the security, as well as the nature of the transaction i.e. , purchase, sale or any other type of acquisition or disposition), the price of the security at which the transaction was effected and the name of the broker, dealer or bank with or through which the transaction was effected. You should disclose any newly opened account containing one or more 

Covered Securities through the Audax Compliance Website after opening the account and should confirm that all accounts are appropriately disclosed as part of the quarterly certification process. . Every calendar quarter, you will be prompted to and must certify through the Audax Compliance Website that you and members of your Family/Household have directed all brokers, dealers and banks to furnish duplicate confirmation statements and account statements directly to the Chief Compliance Officer through the Audax Compliance Website; that no transactions that would be required to be reported were effected during the quarter, except (i) transactions effected through accounts for which you and members of your Family/Household have directed the broker, dealer or bank to send duplicate confirmation statements and account statements directly to the Chief Compliance Officer through the Audax Compliance Website, (ii) statements you have provided directly to the Chief Compliance Officer or a designee, or (iii) transactions reported on Quarterly Transaction Reports; and that, as far as you and members of your Family/Household know, those statements, together with any Quarterly Transaction Reports, are complete and accurate representations of all transactions during the most recent calendar quarter. Independent Directors of Audax BDC are not required to provide or arrange for, or certify that they have provided or arranged for, duplicate confirmation statements and account statements. EXCEPTION: If applicable laws or regulations in the jurisdiction(s) relevant for you or members of your Family/Household prohibit brokers, dealers or banks from providing duplicate transaction confirmation statements directly to the Chief Compliance Officer through the Audax Compliance Website, you or members of your Family/Household were unable to direct the broker, dealer or bank in which you or they had Beneficial Ownership to provide such statements, or you or members of your Family/Household otherwise have transactions in Covered Securities not held by brokers, dealers or banks, you instead must file a Quarterly Transaction Report, as specified below. Note, however, that such Quarterly Transaction Report (attached hereto as Exhibit C) need not list any transactions by you or members of your Family/Household that are covered by duplicate transaction confirmation and account statements sent directly to the Chief Compliance Officer . NOTE: The requirement to furnish duplicate confirmation and account statements to the Chief Compliance Officer is in addition to the preclearance requirement generally applicable to transactions in Covered Securities and certain other transactions. Furnishing a confirmation statement does not constitute compliance with the Code s transaction restrictions and prohibitions. Quarterly Transaction Reports . If applicable laws or regulations in the jurisdictions relevant for you or members of your Family/Household prohibit brokers, dealers or banks from providing duplicate transaction confirmation statements directly to the Chief Compliance Officer , you or members of your Family/Household were unable to direct the broker, dealer or bank in which you or they had Beneficial Ownership to provide such statements, or you or members of your Family/Household otherwise have transactions in Covered Securities not held by brokers, dealers or banks, no later than 30 calendar days after the end of March, June, September and December each year, you must submit a Quarterly Transaction Report electronically through the Audax Compliance Website, which must indicate the submission date thereof. The Quarterly Transaction Report requires you to (i) list all transactions (other than transactions by you or members of your Family/Household that are covered by duplicate transaction confirmation and account statements sent directly to the Chief Compliance Officer during the most recent calendar quarter in Covered Securities (including the date of the transaction, the title and type of security and, as applicable, the exchange ticker symbol or CUSIP number, interest rate and maturity date, the number of shares and principal amount) in which you (or a member of your Family/Household had Beneficial Ownership or (ii) certify that no transactions in Covered Securities took place during the quarter in question. It also requires you to report the nature of the transaction i.e. , purchase, sale or any other type of acquisition or 

disposition), the price of the security at which the transaction was effected and the name of the broker, dealer or bank with or through which the transaction was effected. You must certify in the Quarterly Transaction Report that any transaction confirmation statements and similar information sent by the broker, dealer or bank, directly to the Audax Compliance Website, together with transaction confirmation and account statements submitted directly to the Chief Compliance Officer , accurately reflect all transactions during the most recent calendar quarter in Covered Securities in which you or members of your Family/Household had Beneficial Ownership and were executed through a broker, dealer or bank. Independent Directors of Audax BDC are not required to submit a Quarterly Transaction Report unless such director knew or, in the ordinary course of fulfilling his or her official duties as a director of Audax BDC, should have known that during the 15-day period immediately preceding or after the date of the transaction in a Covered Security by the director such Covered Security is or was purchased or sold by Audax BDC or that Audax BDC was or is considering purchasing or selling such Covered Security . EXCEPTION: You need not report transactions effected pursuant to an automatic investment plan. An automatic investment plan means a program in which regular periodic purchases (or withdrawals) are made automatically in (or from) investment accounts in accordance with a predetermined schedule and allocation. An automatic investment plan includes a dividend reinvestment plan. You also do not need to report transactions in mutual funds or ETFs, and do not need to provide account statements for accounts in which there was not trading activity for the quarter in question.

You will also be required to list all brokers, dealers and banks with which you or a member of your Family/Household maintained an account in which any securities (not just Covered Securities were held for the direct or indirect benefit of you or a member of your Family/Household on December 31 of the prior year.

DEFINITIONS These terms have special meanings in the Code: Beneficial Ownership Chief Compliance Officer Covered Security Family/Household Advised Vehicle Independent Director The special meanings of these terms as used in the Code are explained below. Some of these terms (such as beneficial ownership are sometimes used in other contexts, not related to codes of ethics, where they have different meanings. For example, beneficial ownership has a different meaning in the Code than it does in the SEC s rules for proxy statement disclosure of corporate directors and officers stockholdings, or in determining whether an investor has to file 13D or 13G reports with the SEC. IMPORTANT: If you have any doubt or question about whether an investment, account or person is covered by any of these definitions, ask the Chief Compliance Officer . Please do not guess at the answer. Beneficial Ownership means any opportunity, directly or indirectly, to profit or share in the profit from any transaction in securities. Note that you do not have Beneficial Ownership of holdings in qualified tuition programs established pursuant to Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code 529 Plans if neither the Firm nor a control affiliate of the Firm manages, distributes, markets, or underwrites the 529 Plan or the investments and strategies underlying the 529 Plan. Beneficial Ownership is a very broad concept. Some examples of forms of Beneficial Ownership include: Securities held in a person s own name, or that are held for the person s benefit in nominee, custodial or street name accounts. Securities owned by or for a partnership in which the person is a general partner (whether the ownership is under the name of that partner, another partner or the partnership or through a nominee, custodial or street name account). Securities that are being managed for a person s benefit on a discretionary basis by an investment adviser, broker, bank, trust company or other manager, unless the securities are held in (i) a blind trust or similar arrangement under which the person is prohibited by contract from communicating with the manager of the account and the manager is prohibited from disclosing to the person what investments are held in the account, or (ii) in an account with respect to which the person has certified to the Chief Compliance Officer that the person has had no influence or control regarding any particular transaction made or to be made in the account and the adviser, broker, bank, trust company or other manager has made all investment decisions without informing the person as to the transaction until after the transaction has been effected. (Just putting securities into a discretionary account is not enough to remove them from a person s Beneficial Ownership . This is because, unless the account is of the type described above, the owner of the account can still communicate with the manager about the account and potentially influence the manager s investment decisions.) A person wishing to take advantage of the exception described in (ii) above must also use his or her best efforts to obtain an acknowledgment from the relevant adviser, broker, bank, trust company or other manager that 

such person has no influence or control regarding any particular transaction made or to be made in the relevant account, which acknowledgment must be submitted electronically to the Chief Compliance Officer . Securities in a person s individual retirement account. Securities in a person s account in a 401(k) or similar retirement plan, even if the person has chosen to give someone else investment discretion over the account. Securities owned by a trust of which the person is a beneficiary. Securities owned by a corporation, partnership or other entity that the person controls (whether the ownership is under the name of that person, under the name of the entity or through a nominee, custodial or street name account). Securities owned by an investment club in which the person participates. 
 This is not a complete list of the forms of ownership that could constitute Beneficial Ownership for purposes of the Code. You should ask the Chief Compliance Officer if you have any questions or doubts at all about whether you or a member of your Family/Household would be considered to have Beneficial Ownership in any particular situation. NOTE: By way of clarification, notwithstanding the foregoing, no Advised Vehicle is prohibited by the Code from purchasing or selling a Covered Security of which certain persons covered by the Code might be deemed to have Beneficial Ownership . Chief Compliance Officer means the person designated by the Firm as its chief compliance officer in accordance with Rule 206(4)-7(c) under the Advisers Act, or another person that he or she designates to perform the functions of Chief Compliance Officer when he or she is not available. With respect to Audax BDC, Chief Compliance Officer means the person designated by Audax BDC as its chief compliance officer in accordance with Rule 38a-1 under the 1940 Act, or another person that he or she designates to perform the functions of Chief Compliance Officer when he or she is not available. Currently, the same person serves as the Chief Compliance Officer for the Group Companies. For purposes of reviewing the Chief Compliance Officer s own transactions and reports under the Code, the functions of the Chief Compliance Officer are performed by the Chief Legal Officer of the Firm or his or her designee. Covered Security means (i) any economic interest in any portfolio company of any Advised Vehicle and (ii) anything that is considered a security under section 202(a)(18) of the Advisers Act, except : Direct obligations of the U.S. Government. Bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit, commercial paper and high quality short-term debt instruments, including repurchase agreements. Shares of money market investment companies (i.e., money market funds) registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Shares of open-end investment companies (i.e., mutual funds) registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Shares of unit investment trusts that invest exclusively in one or more open-end investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. 

This is a very broad definition of security. It includes most kinds of investment instruments, including things that you might not ordinarily think of as securities, such as: options on securities, on indexes and on currencies; investments in all kinds of limited partnerships; investments in foreign unit trusts and foreign mutual funds; and investments in hedge funds and private investment funds (including an Advised Vehicle). 
 If you have any question or doubt about whether an investment is a considered a Covered Security under the Code, assume that the investment is a Covered Security and seek guidance from the Chief Compliance Officer . Do not guess . Members of your Family/Household include: Your spouse (unless they do not live in the same household as you and you do not contribute in a material way their support). Your children under the age of 18. Your children who are 18 or older (unless they do not live in the same household as you and you do not contribute in a material way their support). Any of these people who live in your household: your stepchildren, grandchildren, parents, stepparents, grandparents, brothers, sisters, parents-in-law, sons-in-law, daughters-in-law, brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law, including adoptive relationships. 
 COMMENT 1: There are a number of reasons why the Code covers transactions in which members of your Family/Household have Beneficial Ownership . First, the SEC regards any benefit to a person that you help support financially as indirectly benefiting you, because it could reduce the amount that you might otherwise contribute to that person s support. Second, members of your household could, in some circumstances, learn of information regarding the Firm s possible investment transactions, and must not be allowed to benefit from that information. COMMENT 2: If a member of your Family/Household s primary occupation involves buying and selling securities, and you deliver to the CCO a certification acceptable to the CCO regarding such activity, you need not consider that person a member of your Family/Household for purposes of this Code with respect to such transactions made in a professional capacity. All other transactions of such person remain subject to this Code. Advised Vehicle means any investment vehicle that is or may in the future be advised by the Firm, including Audax BDC. Independent Director means a director of Audax BDC who is not an interested person of the Corporation as such term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act.
