Note 1 - 
 
 Revisions to Previously Issued Financial Statements 
 In connection with the preparation of its financial statements for the second quarter of 2024, management corrected a prior computation of the Company s total capital (to risk-weighted assets), Tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets), and Tier 1 capital (to average assets) ratios for purposes of the Company s consolidated financial statements for holding companies filed with the Federal Reserve (the Regulatory Filings ), which involved an incorrect classification of the Company s subordinated notes as Tier 1 capital. This incorrect classification affected the Company's regulatory capital disclosures in certain prior period filings with the SEC, as those disclosures were sourced from the Regulatory Filings. The Company evaluated the effects of the incorrect classification to its previously filed Regulatory Filings and previously issued financial statements in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins No. 99 and No. 108 and, based upon qualitative and quantitative factors, determined the errors were not material to the previously filed Regulatory Filings or the previously issued financial statements and disclosures included in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023, or for any of the quarterly reports included therein or through our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2024. The Company has amended its Regulatory Filings for the periods ended March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 to reclassify the subordinated notes balance from Tier 1 capital into Tier 2 capital. The correction of the classification had no effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures or the amounts or disclosure of the regulatory capital ratios of the Bank as included in its call reports. The Company continues to exceed regulatory proxy ratios to be considered well capitalized , plus the capital conservation buffer, at September 30, 2024. 
 Nature of Business and Basis of Reporting 
 
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Horizon Bancorp, Inc. Horizon or the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Horizon Bank Horizon Bank or the Bank ), which is an Indiana commercial bank. All inter company balances and transactions have been eliminated. The results of operations for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year of 2024 or 2023. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion of Horizon s management, necessary to fairly present the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Horizon for the periods presented. Those adjustments consist only of normal recurring adjustments. 
 Certain information and note disclosures normally included in Horizon s annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP have been condensed or omitted. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Horizon s Annual Report on Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 15, 2024 (the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10 K ). The condensed consolidated balance sheet of Horizon as of December 31, 2023 has been derived from the audited balance sheet as of that date. 
 On July 16, 2019, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a stock repurchase program for up to shares of Horizon s issued and outstanding common stock, no par value. As of September 30, 2024, Horizon had repurchased a total of shares at an average price per share of .

 Certain investments in debt securities are reported in the consolidated financial statements at an amount less than their historical cost. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had and securities, respectively, with market values below their cost basis. The total fair value of these investments at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was billion and billion, which is approximately and , respectively, of the Company's available for sale and held to maturity securities portfolio. These declines resulted primarily from fluctuations in market interest rates after purchase. Management believes the declines in fair value for these securities are temporary. 
 allowance for credit losses for available for sale debt securities was recorded at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 The allowance for credit losses for held to maturity securities is a contra asset valuation account that is deducted from the carrying amount of held to maturity securities to present the net amount expected to be collected. Held to maturity securities are charged off against the allowance for credit loss when deemed uncollectible. Adjustments to the allowance for credit loss are reported in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income in credit loss expense. We measure expected credit losses on held to maturity securities on a collective basis by major security type with each type sharing similar risk characteristics, and consider historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and

 and was recorded on these securities based on applying the long-term historical rating agency credit loss rate for similarly rated securities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 On a quarterly basis, the Company refreshes the credit quality indicator of each held-to-maturity security. The Company applies ratings derived from Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations ("NRSRO"), specifically Moody's and Standard Poor's. For state and municipal securities where no rating is available from the NRSROs, a consistent internally-assigned rating methodology is applied. The amortized cost of these securities in the following tables subject to this methodology totaled million as of September 30, 2024, and million as of December 31, 2023.

Credit loss expense (benefit) ) ) Ending balance 
 Accrued interest receivable on available for sale debt securities and held to maturity secur ities totaled million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023 and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. 
 The U.S. government sponsored entities and agencies and mortgage backed securities are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government, are highly rated by major credit rating agencies, and have a long history of no credit losses. Therefore, for those securities, we do not record expected credit losses. 
 Based on an evaluation of available evidence, management believes the unrealized losses on available for sale state and municipal securities, private labeled mortgage backed pools and corporate notes were due to changes in interest rates. Due to the contractual terms, the issuers of state and municipal securities are not allowed to settle for less than the amortized cost of the security. In addition, the Company does not intend to sell these securities prior to the recovery of the amortized cost, which may not occur until maturity. No allowance for credit losses was recognized for available for sale debt securities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

For purposes of this disclosure, the Company considers default to mean 30 days or more past due of contractual interest or principal. 
 
 The Company did not have any loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that had a payment default during the three and nine month ended September 30, 2023 and had been modified on or after January 1, 2023 (date the Company adopted ASU 2022-02). 
 Collateral Dependent Financial Assets 
 A collateral dependent financial loan relies solely on the operation or sale of the collateral for repayment. In evaluating the overall risk associated with the loan, the Company considers character, overall financial condition and resources, and payment record of the borrower; the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors; and the nature and degree of protection provided by the cash flow and value of any underlying collateral. However, as other sources of repayment become inadequate over time, the significance of the collateral's value increases and the loan may become collateral dependent.

 Credit Quality Indicators 
 Horizon Bank s processes for determining credit quality differ slightly depending on whether a new loan or a renewed loan is being underwritten, or whether an existing loan is being re evaluated for credit quality. The latter usually occurs upon receipt of current financial information or other pertinent data that would trigger a change in the credit quality grade. 
 For new and renewed commercial loans, the Bank s Credit Department, which acts independently of the loan officer, assigns the credit quality grade to the loan. Loan grades for loans with an aggregate credit exposure that exceeds the authorities in the respective regions (ranging from to are validated by the Loan Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Commercial Banking Officer CCBO ). 
 Commercial loan officers are responsible for reviewing their loan portfolios and promptly assessing any adverse change in credit quality and revising the risk rating appropriately. When circumstances warrant a change in the credit quality grade, loan officers are required to notify the Credit Department of the change in the credit quality grade. Downgrades are accepted immediately, however, lenders must present their factual information to the Credit Department when recommending an upgrade. Downgrades to impaired status require the concurrence of the CCBO and the Senior Workout Loan Manager. 
 The CCBO, or a designee, meets periodically with loan officers to discuss the status of past due loans and

 to days delinquent a loan is charged off unless it is well secured and in the process of collection. If the latter case exists, the loan is placed on non accrual. Occasionally a mortgage loan may be graded as Special Mention. When this situation arises, it is because the characteristics of the loan and the borrower fit the definition of a Risk Grade 5 described below, which is normally used for grading commercial loans. Loans not graded Substandard are considered Pass. 
 Horizon Bank employs a nine grade rating system to determine the credit quality of commercial loans. The first five grades represent acceptable quality, and the last four grades mirror the criticized and classified grades used by the bank regulatory agencies (special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss). The loan grade definitions are detailed below. 
 Risk Grade 1: Excellent (Pass) 
 Loans secured by liquid collateral, such as certificates of deposit, reputable bank letters of credit, or other cash equivalents or loans to any publicly held company with a current long term debt rating of A or better and meeting defined key financial metric ranges. 
 Risk Grade 2: Good (Pass) 
 Loans to businesses that have strong financial statements containing an unqualified opinion from a CPA firm and at least consecutive years of profits; loans supported by unaudited financial statements containing strong balance sheets, five consecutive years of profits, a satisfactory relationship with the Bank, and key balance sheet and income statement trends that are either stable or positive; loans secured by publicly traded marketable securities with required margins where there is no impediment to liquidation; loans to individuals backed by liquid personal assets and unblemished credit histories; or loans to publicly held companies with current long term debt ratings of Baa or better and meeting defined key financial metric ranges. 
 Risk Grade 3: Satisfactory (Pass) 
 Loans supported by financial statements (audited or unaudited) that indicate average or slightly below average risk and having some deficiency or vulnerability to changing economic conditions; loans with some weakness but offsetting features of other support are readily available; loans that are meeting the terms of repayment, but which may be susceptible to deterioration if adverse factors are encountered and meeting defined key financial metric ranges. Loans may be graded Satisfactory when there is no recent information on which to base a current risk evaluation and the following conditions apply: 
 At inception, the loan was properly underwritten, did not possess an unwarranted level of credit risk, and the loan met the above criteria for a risk grade of Excellent, Good, or Satisfactory; 
 At inception, the loan was secured with collateral possessing a loan value adequate to protect the Bank from loss. 
 The loan has exhibited two or more years of satisfactory repayment with a reasonable reduction of the principal balance. 
 During the period that the loan has been outstanding, there has been no evidence of any credit weakness. Some examples of weakness include slow payment, lack of cooperation by the borrower, breach of loan covenants, or the borrower is in an industry known to be experiencing problems. If any of these credit weaknesses is observed, a lower risk grade may be warranted. 
 Risk Grade 4: Satisfactory/Monitored (Pass)

 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. There were no changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may exist. When assessing goodwill for impairment, first, a qualitative assessment can be made to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its estimated carrying value. If the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is performed. Alternatively, a quantitative goodwill test can be performed without performing a qualitative assessment. 
 
 goodwill impairment charges were recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. During the third quarter of 2024, Horizon considered the amount by which fair value exceeded book value by performing a qualitative analysis. The Company engaged a third-party valuation specialist in performing its quantitative impairment analysis during the third quarter of 2023, which included a combination of valuation approaches to determine the fair value of the Bank reporting unit. These valuation approaches required certain assumptions such as the discount rate, economic conditions impacting interest and growth rates, the control premium, and a relative weighting given to the fair value derived by each of the valuation approaches used and supported that the fair value of goodwill exceeded its carrying value. At the conclusion of the quantitative analysis for the third quarter of 2023, the Company determined that as of September 30, 2023, it was more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill exceeded its carrying value.

The Notes are structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of Horizon's subsidiaries, including the deposit liabilities and claims of other creditors of Horizon Bank, and are effectively subordinated to Horizon s existing and future secured indebtedness.

 on a notional amount of million. Under the agreement, the Company paid or received the net interest amount monthly, with the monthly settlements included in interest expense. The Company terminated this interest rate swap agreement on May 23, 2023 and recorded a related gain of million as a reduction of interest expense. 
 For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings. 
 Fair Value Hedges 
 Fair value hedges are intended to reduce the interest rate risk associated with the underlying hedged item. The Company enters into fixed rate loan agreements as part of its lending policy. To mitigate the risk of changes in fair value based on fluctuations in interest rates, the Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements on individual loans, converting the fixed rate loans to a variable rate. Additionally, the Company entered into fair value hedges for certain of our fixed rate AFS municipal securities. The instruments are designated as fair value hedges as the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap are expected to offset changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to changes in the SOFR swap rate, the designated benchmark interest rate. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings. The change in fair value of both the hedge instruments and the underlying hedged item are recorded as gains or losses in non interest income. At September 30, 2024, the Company s fair value hedges were effective and are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s net income over the next months.

 Forward Looking Statements 
 This report contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, with respect to Horizon Bancorp, Inc. Horizon or the Company and Horizon Bank (the Bank ). Horizon intends such forward looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements contained in the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995, and is including this statement for the purposes of these safe harbor provisions. Statements in this report should be considered in conjunction with the other information available about Horizon, including the information in the other filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The forward looking statements are based on management s expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. We have tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements by using words such as anticipate, expect, estimate, project, intend, plan, believe, could, will and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements. 
 Actual results may differ materially, adversely or positively, from the expectations of the Company that are expressed or implied by any forward looking statement. Risks, uncertainties, and factors that could cause the Company s actual results to vary materially from those expressed or implied by any forward looking statement include but are not limited to: 
 current financial conditions within the banking industry; 
 changes in the level and volatility of interest rates, spreads on earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, and interest rate sensitivity; 
 the aggregate effects of elevated inflation levels in recent years; 
 loss of key Horizon personnel; 
 macroeconomic conditions and their impact on Horizon and its customers; 
 the increasing use of Bitcoin and other crypto currencies and/or stable coin and the possible impact these alternative currencies may have on deposit disintermediation and income derived from payment systems; 
 the effect of interest rates on net interest rate margin and their impact on mortgage loan volumes and the outflow of deposits; 
 increases in disintermediation, as new technologies allow consumers to complete financial transactions without the assistance of banks; 
 potential loss of fee income, including interchange fees, as new and emerging alternative payment platforms (e.g., Apple Pay or Bitcoin) take a greater market share of the payment systems; 
 estimates of fair value of certain of Horizon s assets and liabilities; 
 volatility and disruption in financial markets; 
 changes in prepayment speeds, loan originations, credit losses and market values, collateral securing loans and other assets; 
 changes in sources of liquidity; 
 potential risk of environmental liability related to lending and acquisition activities;

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10 K contain a summary of the Company s significant accounting policies. Certain of these policies are important to the portrayal of the Company s financial condition, since they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company considers these policies to be its critical accounting estimates. Management has identified as critical accounting policies the allowance for credit losses, goodwill and intangible assets, mortgage servicing rights, hedge accounting and valuation measurements. 
 
 For additional information regarding critical accounting estimates, see Note 1 Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Item 8 of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes in the Company s application of critical accounting estimates since December 31, 2023.

 Net Income 
 
 Net income increased 2.0 million to 18.2 million, or 0.42 per share, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to 16.2 million, or 0.37 per share, for the same period in 2023. The increase from the year ago period was primarily driven by an increase in net interest income and a reduction in the effective tax rate in the current period, partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense when compared to the year ago period. Net interest income

 increased by 4.8 million, or 11.5 when compared with the year ago period, driven by a modest increase in average earning assets and a 25 basis point increase in the net FTE interest margin 1 , to 2.66 in the current period. 
 
 Net income declined 6.9 million to 46.3 million, or 1.06 per share, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to 53.2 million, or 1.22 per share, for the same period in 2023. The decrease from the year ago period was primarily a result of growth in non-interest expense, a decline in non-interest income and increased provision for loan loss related to loan growth in the current period. 
 
 Net Interest Income 
 
 Net interest income increased 4.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, to 46.9 million, when compared to the same period in 2023. While average earning asset growth was modest, the reported net FTE interest margin 1 increased by 25 basis points, to 2.66 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the year ago period, attributable to the favorable mix shift in both average interest earning assets toward higher-yielding loans and the funding mix toward lower cost deposit liabilities, in addition to a higher contribution to the net FTE interest margin 1 from interest-free funds. Interest accretion from the fair value of acquired loans did not contribute significantly to the third quarter net interest income, or net FTE interest margin 1 .

 Net interest income increased 2.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, to 135.5 million, when compared to the same period in 2023. Growth in average earning asset balances and a 1 basis point increase in the reported net FTE interest margin 2 , to 2.60 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the year ago period drove the net interest income growth versus the year ago comparable period. The net FTE interest margin expansion over the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was modest, as the increased contribution from interest-free funds was largely offset by the contraction in the net spread between the yield on earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.

 Total non-interest income declined 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, and declined 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Primary drivers of the periodic changes are noted below. 
 
 Service charges on deposit accounts increased 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The increases compared to the year ago periods were primarily a result of higher transaction-based fee activity in the current period. 
 
 Interchange fees, which include fees earned on qualified debit card volume and merchant processing fees, increased 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The increases were primarily driven by growth in qualified debit card volume for both periods. 
 
 Mortgage servicing income decreased 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by higher levels of amortization expense of mortgage servicing rights in the current period. 
 
 Cash value of bank owned life insurance decreased 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The declines were due to the surrender of several policies during the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 
 Other income, which includes various miscellaneous income items as well as fair market value adjustments to certain other assets, increased by 0.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily related to positive fair market value adjustments on certain marketable securities. 
 
 Non-Interest Expense 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, September 30, September 30, (Dollars in Thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Non-interest Expense Salaries and employee benefits 21,829 20,058 62,680 58,932 Net occupancy expenses 3,207 3,283 9,945 10,095 Data processing 2,977 2,999 8,020 8,684 Professional fees 676 707 1,997 1,873 Outside services and consultants 3,677 2,316 10,094 7,548 Loan expense 1,034 1,120 2,791 3,635 FDIC insurance expense 1,204 1,300 3,839 2,680 Core deposit intangible amortization 844 903 2,560 2,709 Other losses 297 188 828 543 Other expense 3,527 3,294 11,147 10,255 Total non-interest expense 39,272 36,168 113,901 106,954 
 
 Non-interest expense increased 3.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily the result of higher expenses related to outside services and consultants, salaries and employee benefits, and other expenses, which was partially mitigated by lower expenses related to FDIC insurance expense and net occupancy expense. Non-interest expense increased 6.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily the result of higher expenses related to salaries and employee benefits, outside services and consultants, FDIC insurance, and other expense. 
 
 Salaries and employee benefits expense increased by 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , and 3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , when compared to the same periods a year ago. The increase

 in both periods is partially attributable to growth in salary expense related to ongoing hiring efforts in revenue generating roles in commercial lending, equipment finance and treasury management. In addition, the current period was unfavorably impacted by an expense related to a legacy benefits program and additional compensation-related accrual relative to the prior periods. 
 
 Outside services and consultant expense increased by 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , and 2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , when compared to the same periods a year ago. The increase in both periods is related to ongoing strategic initiatives . 
 
 FDIC insurance expense increased by 1.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the year ago period. The increase in the period related to higher incurred assessment rates. 
 
 Other expenses, which includes corporate and other service expenses, increased by 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023, and increased by 0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Liability for Unfunded Lending Commitments

 Horizon assesses the adequacy of its Allowance for Credit Losses ACL by regularly reviewing the performance of its loan portfolio against various economic backdrops, which periodically change. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses on loans of 1.0 million. This compares to a provision for credit losses on loans of 0.3 million during the third quarter of 2023. The increase in the provision for credit losses when compared to the year ago period was primarily attributable to changes in loan mix and in the economic forecast. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net loan charge-offs decreased by 0.4 million to 0.4 million, compared to 0.8 million in the third quarter of last year. 
 
 The provision for credit losses on loans of 4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 3.0 million when compared to the prior year period, which is primarily attributable to loan growth and the change in loan mix.

 For the Three and Nine Months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net loan charge-offs decreased by 0.3 million to 1.3 million compared to 1.6 million in the prior year period. 
 
 The Company s allowance for credit losses as a percentage of period-end loans HFI was 1.10 at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.14 at September 30, 2023. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the liability for unfunded lending commitments was relatively unchanged at 0.7 million when compared to the third quarter of last year. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The Company s income tax expense for the third quarter of 2024 was 0.1 million c ompared to 1.3 million for the third quarter of 2023, resulting in effective tax rates of 0.4 and 7.3 , respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the third quarter 2024 is primarily due to the increase in the net realizable tax credits for the current year . 
 
 The Company s income tax expense for the first nine months of 2024 was 3.0 million compared to 4.6 million for the same period in 2023, resulting in effective tax rates of 6.0 and 8.0 , respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the first nine months 2024 is primarily due to the increase in net realizable tax credits in the current period. 
 
 The effective income tax rates differed from the U.S. statutory federal income tax rates of 21 during the comparable periods primarily due to the effect of tax exempt income from securities, loans, and life insurance policies, and net tax benefits from tax credit investments.

 Total assets decreased by 13.0 million, or 0.2 , as of September 30, 2024, from 7.9 billion as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in total assets is primarily due to decreases in cash and cash equivalents of 291.7 million over the period, or 55.4 , to 234.8 million as of September 30, 2024, and a decrease in total securities balances of 63.3 million, to 2.4 billion, partially offset by growth in loans HFI of 383.5 million, or 8.8 , to 4.8 billion as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Total investment securities decreased 63.3 million, or 2.5 , to 2.4 billion as of September 30, 2024 from 2.5 billion as of December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of amortization and maturities. There were no purchases of investment securities during the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 Total loans HFI increased to 4.8 billion as of September 30, 2024 compared to 4.4 billion as of December 31, 2023, led by organic commercial loan growth of 239.1 million. The company continues to maintain a balanced growth profile across various geographies, products and industries, and holds a diverse lending portfolio consisting primarily of commercial real estate, consumer, residential and commercial and industrial portfolios. 
 
 Total deposit balances increased by 62.1 million, or 1.1 , to 5.7 billion on September 30, 2024 when compared to balances as of December 31, 2023. The Company maintains a granular and tenured deposit base, with a continued focus on core commercial and consumer deposit gathering. 
 
 Total borrowings decreased by 87.9 million, or 6.5 , to 1.3 billion as of September 30, 2024 when compared to balances as of December 31, 2023, primarily related to repayment of a portion of Federal Home Loan Bank advances in August.

 Liquidity 
 The Bank maintains a stable base of core deposits provided by long standing relationships with individuals and local businesses. These deposits are the principal source of liquidity for Horizon. Other sources of liquidity for Horizon include earnings, loan repayment, investment security sales and maturities, proceeds from the sale of residential mortgage loans, unpledged investment securities and borrowing relationships with correspondent banks, including the FHLB. At September 30, 2024, in addition to liquidity available from the normal operating, funding, and investing activities of Horizon, the Bank had approximately 1.52 billion in unused credit lines with various money center banks, including the FHLB and the FRB Discount Window compared to 1.41 billion at December 31, 2023. 
 The cash flows from the operating, investing and financing activities of the Company resulted in a net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of 291.7 million during the first nine months of 2024, as reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows in this report. Operating activities, consisting mainly of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, provided cash flow of 54.7 million and have historically been a stable source of funds. Investing activities, which occur mainly in the loan and investment securities portfolios, used cash of 322.4 million mainly due to growth in the loan portfolio, which used cash of 413.4 million. Financing activities used cash of 24.0 million, largely resulting from the repayment of long-term borrowings of 563.1 million and 21.3 million in dividends paid on common stock during the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 Capital Resources 
 The capital resources of Horizon and the Bank exceeded regulatory capital ratios for well capitalized banks at September 30, 2024. Stockholders equity totaled 754.8 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 718.8 million as of December 31, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the ratio of average stockholders equity to average assets was 9.30 compared to 8.97 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. The increase in stockholders equity during the period was due to net income generated during the period and the improved market value of securities available for sale, offset by cash dividends paid to common shareholders. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the ratio of total stockholders equity to total assets is 9.52 . Book value per common share was 17.27, increasing 0.80 compared to December 31, 2023. 
 Tangible common equity 1 totaled 588.5 million at September 30, 2024, and the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets 1 was 7.58 at September 30, 2024. Tangible book value, which excludes intangible assets from total equity, per common share 1 was 13.46, increasing 0.87 compared to December 31, 2023. 
 Horizon declared common stock dividends in the amount of 0.48 per share during the first nine months of 2024 and 0.48 per share for the same period in 2023. The dividend payout ratio (dividends as a percent of basic earnings per share) was 45.3 and 39.3 for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. For additional information regarding dividends, see Horizon s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10 K.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Interest rate risk management focuses on monitoring and maintaining variances in the Company's net interest income profile due to changes in interests rates to within Board-approved policy limits. The Company primarily uses earnings simulation models to expose net interest income to 12- and 24- month sensitivities to various movements in rates. Simulations are modeled quarterly to include scenarios where market rates change instantaneously up or down in a parallel or non-parallel manner, which account for the periodic changes in the balance sheet composition. For further discussion of the Company s market risk, see the Interest Rate Sensitivity section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 The table below shows the modelled effects of an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates on the Company's net interest income profile over a one-year horizon versus the base case net interest income in a flat rate scenario. The simulation model assumes a static balance sheet over that twelve month period, and utilizes various non-maturity interest bearing deposit beta assumptions, based on the underlying products, ranging from 12 to 80 in the disclosed model outputs below. Deposit beta is an estimate for how quickly interest-bearing deposit pricing will change for a given change in interest rates. Because of limitations inherent in any approach used to measure interest rate risk, simulation results are not intended as a forecast of the actual effect of a change in market interest rates on our results, but rather to provide insight into our current interest rate exposure and to assist in the execution of appropriate asset/liability management strategies. As shown below, the model output would indicate that as of September 30, 2024, the Company's interest-bearing liabilities are projected to reprice at a faster pace than interest-earning assets for the next 100 basis points of declining interest rates. 
 
 September 30, 2024 (Dollars in millions) Change in Net Interest Income Change in Net Interest Income 200 basis points rising (17.7) (7.9) 100 basis points rising (7.9) (3.5) 100 basis points falling 2.8 1.3 200 basis points falling (2.7) (1.2)

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Based on an evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, Horizon s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of Horizon s disclosure controls (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a 15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act )). Based on such evaluation, such officers have concluded that, as of the evaluation date, Horizon's disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by Horizon in the reports it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time specified in Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in those reports is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosures. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Horizon s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, also have concluded that during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, there have been no changes in Horizon s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Horizon s internal control over financial reporting.
