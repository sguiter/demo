TILRAY BRANDS, INC. 
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Investments in entities over which the Company does not have a controlling financial interest but has significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method, with the Company s share of earnings or losses reported in earnings or losses from equity method investments on the statements of net loss and comprehensive loss. Equity method investments are recorded at cost, adjusted for the Company s share of undistributed earnings or losses, and impairment, if any, within Interest in equity investees on the balance sheets. The Company assesses investments in equity method investments when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may be impaired. If it is determined that the current fair value of an equity method investment is less than the carrying value of the investment, the Company will assess if the shortfall is other than temporary (OTTI). Evidence of a loss in value might include, but would not necessarily be limited to, absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment or inability of the equity investee to sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment. Once a determination is made that an OTTI exists, the investment is written down to its fair value in accordance with ASC 820 at the reporting date, which establishes a new cost basis. 
 
 and common shares from RSUs, and common shares from share options, and common shares for warrants and and common shares for convertible debentures, respectively. 

In determining the transaction price for the sale of goods or services, the Company considers the effects of variable consideration and the existence of significant financing components, if any. 
 
 We may enter into certain contracts for the sale of goods or services, which provide customers with rights of return, volume discounts, bonuses for volume/quality achievement, and/or sales allowances. In addition, the Company may provide in certain circumstances, a retrospective price reduction to a customer based primarily on inventory movement. The inclusion of these items may give rise to variable consideration. The Company uses the expected value method to estimate the variable consideration because this method provides the most accurate estimation of the amount of variable consideration to which the Company will be entitled. The Company uses historical evidence, current information and forecasts to estimate the variable consideration. The Company reduces revenue and recognizes a contract liability equal to the amount expected to be refunded to the customer in the form of a future rebate or credit for a retrospective price reduction, representing its obligation to return the customer s consideration. The estimate is updated at each reporting period date. 
 
 On July 12, 2022, the Company and HEXO Corp. ("HEXO") entered into various commercial transaction agreements, as described in Note 24 (Segment reporting), which included an advisory services arrangement. The fees associated with the advisory services arrangement were recognized as revenue when such services were provided to HEXO. Any payments that were received for such services in advance of performance were recognized as a contract liability. On June 22, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of HEXO as described in Note 6 (Business acquisitions), simultaneously terminating the advisory services arrangement and other commercial transactions.

The Company has agreed to pay Molson as contingent consideration an amount equal to 57.5 of any proceeds from any divesture, net of any costs and expenses associated with the disposition.

Legal proceedings 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, we are at times subject to various legal proceedings and disputes, including the proceedings specifically discussed below. We assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings utilizing the latest information available. Where it is probable that we will incur a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements. These legal reserves may be increased or decreased to reflect any relevant developments on a quarterly basis. Where a loss is not probable or the amount of loss is not estimable, we do not accrue legal reserves. While the outcome of legal proceedings is inherently uncertain, based on information currently available and available insurance coverage, our management believes that it has established appropriate legal reserves. Any incremental liabilities arising from pending legal proceedings are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations, or consolidated cash flows. However, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to our consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations, or consolidated cash flows. 
 
 There have been no material changes from the legal proceedings since our Annual Report on Form 10 -K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2023 , except with respect to certain aspects of the legal proceedings disclosed below: 
 
 Class Action Suits and Stockholder Derivative Suits 
 
 Authentic Brands Group Related Class Action (New York, United States) 
 
 On May 4, 2020, Ganesh Kasilingam filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York SDNY ), against Tilray Brands, Inc., Brendan Kennedy and Mark Castaneda, on behalf of himself and a putative class, seeking to recover damages for alleged violations of Sections 10 (b) and 20 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Kasilingam litigation ). The complaint alleges that Tilray and the individual defendants overstated the anticipated advantages of the Company s revenue sharing agreement with Authentic Brands Group ABG ), announced on January 15, 2019, and that the plaintiff suffered losses when Tilray s stock price dropped after Tilray recognized an impairment with respect to the ABG deal on March 2, 2020. On August 6, 2020, SDNY entered an order appointing Saul Kassin as Lead Plaintiff and The Rosen Law Firm, P.A. as Lead Counsel. Lead Plaintiff filed an amended complaint on October 5, 2020, which asserts the same Sections 10 (b) and 20 (a) claims against the same defendants on largely the same theory, and includes new allegations that Tilray s reported inventory, cost of sales, and gross margins in its financial reports during the class period were false and misleading because Tilray improperly recorded unsellable trim as inventory and understated the cost of sales for its products. 

On September 27, 2021, the U.S. District Court entered an Opinion Order granting the Defendants motion to dismiss the amended complaint in the Kasilingam litigation without prejudice. On December 3, 2021, the lead plaintiff filed a second amended complaint alleging similar claims against Tilray and Brendan Kennedy. The defendants moved to dismiss the second amended complaint on February 2, 2022. On September 28, 2022, the Court granted in part and denied in part the defendants motion to dismiss the second amended complaint. On October 12, 2022, the Company filed a motion for reconsideration and/or interlocutory appeal of this Court decision. 
 
 On August 21, 2023, the U.S. District Court granted Tilray s motion for reconsideration and dismissed the second amended complaint with leave to amend one final time. Tilray continues to believe that all of the underlying claims are without merit, and that the plaintiff will not be able to fix the deficiencies in its claims as part of its amended complaint.

The Company s financial assets and liabilities required to be measured on a recurring basis are its convertible notes receivable, equity investments measured at fair value, convertible debentures measured at fair value, acquisition-related contingent consideration, and warrant liability. 
 
 Convertible notes receivable and long-term investments are recorded at fair value. The estimated fair value is determined using the Black Scholes option pricing model, probability of legalization and is classified as Level 3. 
 
 Convertible debentures payable are recorded at fair value when elected or required under US GAAP. Specifically, the APHA 24 instrument's estimated fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is classified as Level 3. 
 
 Certain equity investments recorded at fair value have quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and are classified as Level 1.The Company classified securities with observable inputs as level 2 and without a quoted market price as Level 3. 
 
 The warrants associated with the warrant liability are classified as Level 3 derivatives. Consequently, the estimated fair value of the warrant liability is determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model. Until the warrants are exercised, expire, or other facts and circumstances lead the warrant liability to be reclassified to stockholders equity, the warrant liability (which relates to warrants to purchase shares of common stock) is marked-to-market each reporting period with the change in fair value recorded in change in fair value of warrant liability.

Trends and Other Factors Affecting Our Business 
 
 Canadian cannabis market trends: 
 
 The cannabis industry in Canada continues to evolve at a rapid pace during the early periods following the federal legalization of adult-use cannabis. Through analysis of the current market conditions, the following key trends have emerged and are anticipated to influence the near-term future in the industry: 

- 
 Market share . Tilray continues to maintain its market leadership position in Canada. During the quarter, we experienced a significant increase in market share in Canada, with our share increasing from 8.1 to a 13.4 from the immediately preceding quarter, as reported by Hifyre data for all provinces excluding Quebec where Weedcrawler was deemed more accurate. This increase was driven by the strategic acquisitions of HEXO and Truss during the quarter which contributed favorably to our increase in adult use revenue. We expect that during the next fiscal year, the contribution to our market share from these acquired lines of business will fluctuate until they are fully absorbed into our distribution channels. 

- 
 Price compression. We have historically seen price compression in the market, when compared to the prior fiscal year, which was driven by intense competition from the approximately 1,000 Licensed Producers in Canada. The price compression year over year has reduced the Company's revenue by approximately 3.1 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023, which affects our cannabis gross margin as well as our bottom line. 

- 
 Excise taxes. Given the impacts of the above-referenced price compression, excise tax continues to become a larger component of net revenue as it is predominantly computed as a fixed price on grams sold rather than as a percentage of the selling price. The Cannabis Council of Canada has formed an Excise Task Force to present these challenges to the Ministry of Finance in Canada and continues to pursue reform. Additionally, as many as two-thirds of Canadian licensed producers had excise tax deficits owed, which they were unable to pay on time. The Company believes this may result in insolvencies and may be a key element of potential consolidation in the industry and we believe long term there is a possibility of some level of reform but it will likely not occur in the near term. 

- 
 Timing difference in recognizing synergized operating results . As we continue to acquire businesses such as HEXO and Truss, a large part of our strategy involves removing legacy costs from these businesses as part of our acquisition strategy. Once we have completed our full 27 million synergy plan for HEXO and integrated Truss's operations, we expect our operating results to be more profitable. 

- 
 Change facility utilization as a result of acquisitions . We continue to assess our facilities for further optimization or cost reduction to ensure utilization is prioritized and our value chain is operating at its peak efficiency. During this period of facility optimization, we expect there to be a temporary short-term negative impact on our operating results until our capacity is optimized. 

These identified trends have had impacts on the current period results of operations and are discussed in greater detail in the respective sections. 
 
 International cannabis market trends: 

30

The cannabis industry in Europe is in its early stages of development whereby countries within Europe are at different stages of legalization of medical and adult-use cannabis as some countries have expressed a clear political ambition to legalize adult-use cannabis (Germany, Portugal, Luxembourg and Czech Republic), some are engaging in an experiment for adult-use (Netherlands, Switzerland) and some are debating regulations for cannabinoid-based medicine (France, Spain, Italy, and the United Kingdom). In Europe, we believe that, despite continuing recessionary economic conditions and the Russian conflict with Ukraine, cannabis legalization (both medicinal and adult-use) will continue to gain traction albeit more slowly than originally expected. We also continue to believe that Tilray remains uniquely positioned to maintain and gain significant market share in these markets with its infrastructure and its investments, which is comprised of two EU-GMP cultivation facilities within Europe located in Portugal and Germany, our distribution network and our demonstrated commitment to the availability, quality and safety of our cannabinoid-based medical products. Today, Germany remains the largest medical cannabis market in Europe. 
 
 The following is a summary of the state of cannabis legalization within Europe: 
 
 Germany . In late October 2022, the German government published key details of its plan to legalize and regulate adult-use cannabis, including what Health Minister Karl Lauterbach described as complete cultivation within the country. 
 
 Recently, Mr. Lauterbach advised that the proposal had been revised and that the new plan is a two-part model, which appears to be designed in order to legalize cannabis as broadly as possibly without running afoul of European Union rules. On July 6, 2023, it was announced that the draft regulations pertaining to decriminalization, home cultivation and non-commercial cultivation associations (i.e., social clubs) had been finalized by the health ministry and was ready to be delivered to the German parliament, which is expected to take place in the Fall of 2023. 
 
 We continue to believe that Tilray is well-positioned in Germany to provide consistent and sustainable cannabis products for the adult-use market whether only in-country cultivation is permitted or whether imports are also allowed given our Aphria RX facility located in Germany and our EU-GMP-certified production facility in Portugal, as well as our distribution platform, which provides us with access to 13,000 pharmacies in Germany. 
 
 Switzerland. In October 2021, Switzerland announced its intention to legalize cannabis by allowing production, cultivation, trade, and consumption. In the meantime, a three-year pilot project commenced on January 30, 2023, which permits selected participants to purchase cannabis for adult-use in various pharmacies in Basel, and more recently in Zurich, to conduct studies on the cannabis market and its impact on Swiss society. It is the first trial for the legal distribution of adult-use cannabis containing THC in Europe. 
 
 Spain. The Spanish Congress' Health Committee has recently approved a Medical Cannabis Report that paves the way for a government-sponsored bill on medical cannabis. The Report explicitly opens the door to standardized preparations other than the drugs already approved, highlighting their advantages in relation to safety, security and stability; as well as the possibility to prescribe medical cannabis in community pharmacies and not only in hospitals, favoring the access to the patients that may need it. 
 
 France . France launched a two-year pilot experiment to supply approximately 3,000 patients with medical cannabis. To date, 2,300 patients are enrolled in the experiment, which has been extended for another year and is now ending March 2024 in order to collect more data and to adopt a legal framework. The first results of the experimentation are positive. Several independent agencies have produced reports that show the effectiveness of medical cannabis, especially in situations of chronic pain. 
 
 Czech Republic. The Czech Republic has discussed plans to launch a fully regulated adult-use cannabis market and is reviewing in the context of the European regulations. 
 
 Malta . In 2021, became the first country in the European Union to legalize personal possession of the drug and permit private cannabis clubs, where members can grow and share the drug. 
 
 Beverage alcohol market trends: 

The beverage alcohol category, while more established, continues to shift with changes in consumer trends for the craft industry. Specifically, based on IRI data, for the last 13 weeks ended August 27, 2023, the US beer industry grew 3.14 , with craft beer growing 0.71 , a slight improvement from the immediately preceding quarter. Nationally SweetWater trends softened during the three months ended August 31, 2023, due to the timing of key marketing programming being pushed into our second quarter, while SweetWater s home market remained in a growth trend, finishing an increased 5.9 in the quarter. SweetWater is expected to return to growth nationally at the start of the second quarter through programming and innovation. Early results from the launch of SweetWater s latest innovation, Gummies, are encouraging, with the brand quickly becoming a top 3 offering in activated markets. Additionally, Montauk finished the period with an increased 9.2 growth based on IRI data for the aforementioned period, through sustained success in home markets and new market expansion. The Company anticipates continued growth through focused innovation, targeted marketing efforts, and gains in distribution across the portfolio of brands. 

Breckenridge Distillery is a leader in the bourbon industry and continues to gain market share in both the vodka and gin markets. A primary growth objective is to continue expansion of market share across the United States, including expanding the national chain's footprint, to maintain a double-digit annual top-line growth. To ensure continued growth in the future, the company is focused on expanding the marketing strategy, highlighting its quality products. Recent media coverage includes coverage of newly released products, the expanded Denver Broncos Sponsorship, and recognition of the world class restaurant located at the distillery. The overall whiskey market continues to grow through premiumization and expanding into new target demographics. The Company expects its spirits business to continue to grow with the integration of the national distributer agreement with RNDC as well as new product offerings. 

31

Wellness market trends: 
 
 Manitoba Harvest s branded hemp business continued to expand its U.S. and Canadian leading market share position this year. During the quarter, the Company successfully continued expansion of its Hemp Food portfolio into more accessible consumer formats with the continued launch of a breakthrough CBD wellness beverage, Happy Flower . The Company will look to expand the Happy Flower brand with retail distribution into key markets, focusing on U.S. states with established CBD permissibility and sales momentum in future periods. 
 
 Acquisitions, Strategic Transactions and Synergies 
 
 We strive to continue to expand our business on a consolidated basis, through a combination of organic growth and acquisition. While we continue to execute against our strategic initiatives that we believe will result in the long-term, sustainable growth and value to our stockholders, we continue to evaluate potential acquisitions and other strategic transactions of businesses that we believe complement our existing portfolio, infrastructure and capabilities or provide us with the opportunity to enter attractive new geographic markets and product categories as well as expand our existing capabilities. In addition, we have exited certain businesses and continue to evaluate certain businesses within our portfolio that are dilutive to profitability and cash flow. As a result, we incur transaction costs in connection with identifying and completing acquisitions and strategic transactions, as well as ongoing integration costs as we combine acquired companies and continue to achieve synergies, which is offset by income generated in connection with the execution of these transactions. For the three months ended August 31, 2023, we incurred 8.5 million of transaction expenses, discussed further below. 
 
 Our acquisition strategy has had a material impact on the Company s results in the current quarter and we expect will continue into future periods generating accretive impacts for our stockholders. There are currently three primary cost saving initiatives as follows: 

HEXO acquisition: 

On June 22, 2023, Tilray acquired HEXO Corp. HEXO as discussed in Note 6 (Business acquisitions). With the HEXO Acquisition, Tilray expects to achieve additional cost savings in excess of 27M on an annualized pre-tax basis, driven by synergies across production, sales, marketing, distribution, and corporate savings, with potential incremental upside resulting from consolidating packaging, procurement, freight, and logistics. This builds on Tilray s substantial progress optimizing its Canadian cannabis operations discussed below. During the three months ended August 31, 2023, we have achieved 17.1 million of our synergy plan on an annualized run-rate basis of which 2.9 million represented actual cost savings during the period. As discussed in our trends section, these saving initiatives take time to implement, resulting in related benefits being realized over time. 

32

Cannabis business cost reduction plan: 

During the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, the Company launched a 30 million cost optimization plan of our existing cannabis business to solidify our position as an industry leading low-cost producer. The Company took decisive action to manage cash flow amid an evolving retail environment by identifying opportunities to leverage technology, supply chain, procurement, and packaging efficiencies while driving labor savings. In the current period ended August 31, 2023, we have achieved 22 million of our cost optimization plan on an annualized run-rate basis of which 21 million represented actual cost savings during the period. The amount achieved is comprised of the following items: 

- 
 Optimizing cultivation . We made impactful strides to right-size our cultivation footprint by maximizing our yield per plant and by honing the ability to flex production during optimal growing seasons to manage our cost to grow. 

- 
 Refining selling fees. We assessed our current product-to-market strategy to optimize our direct and controllable selling fees as a percentage of revenue without compromising our sales strategy on a go-forward basis. 

- 
 Reducing general and administrative costs . We remain focused on reducing operating expenses by leveraging innovative solutions to maintain a lean organization. We plan to further automate processes, reducing outside spend where efficient, and ensuring we are obtaining competitive pricing on our administrative services. 

International Cannabis business cost reduction plan : 

During our fiscal year ended May 31 2023, the Company launched an 8.0 million cost optimization plan for our international cannabis business to adapt to changing market dynamics and slower than anticipated legalization in Europe. In the current period ended August 31, 2023, the Company achieved an annualized run-rate basis of 6.8 million of cost savings. This was driven by the integration of our Distribution and European cannabis business for redundant costs including headcount consolidation in addition to optimization of our facility utilization. 
 
 In addition to our cost saving strategies, the Company has also executed the following strategic transactions during the quarter: 

Beverage Alcohol Acquisitions: 

On August 7, 2023, the Company entered into a securities and asset purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement by and among Anheuser-Busch Companies, LLC, Craft USA Holdings, LLC, Craft Brew Alliance, Inc. (collectively, AB ), the Company and Tilray Beverages, LLC. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Tilray will acquire a portfolio of craft beer brands, assets and businesses from AB that includes Breckenridge Brewery, Blue Point, 10 Barrel, Redhook, Widmer Brothers, Square Mile, Shock Top and HiBall. The purchase price to be paid to AB at closing is expected to be equal to 85.0 million in cash, subject to working capital and other applicable closing adjustments. The acquisition closed on September 29, 2023 as described in Note 25 (Subsequent events), and is expected to be transformational to our growing beverage alcohol strategy. 

33

Political and Economic Environment 
 
 Our results of operations can also be affected by economic, political, legislative, regulatory, legal actions, the global volatility and general market disruption resulting from geopolitical tensions, such as Russia's incursion into Ukraine. Economic conditions, such as recessionary trends, inflation, supply chain disruptions, interest and monetary exchange rates, and government fiscal policies, and the recent banking credit crises, can have a significant effect on operations. Accordingly, we could be affected by civil, criminal, environmental, regulatory or administrative actions, claims or proceedings.

Use of Non-GAAP Measures 
 
 Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including reference to: 

adjusted gross profit (excluding purchase price allocation PPA fair value step up) for each reporting segment (Cannabis, Beverage alcohol, Distribution and Wellness) as applicable, 

adjusted gross margin (excluding purchase price allocation PPA fair value step up) for each reporting segment (Cannabis, Beverage alcohol, Distribution and Wellness) as applicable, 

adjusted EBITDA, 

cash and marketable securities, and 

constant currency presentation of net revenue. 

All these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, ("GAAP"). These measures, which may be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies, are presented to help investors' overall understanding of our financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Please see "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Measures" below for reconciliation of such non-GAAP Measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as well as a discussion of our adjusted gross margin, adjusted gross profit and adjusted EBITDA measures and the calculation of such measures. 
 
 Constant Currency Presentation 
 
 We believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it provides transparency to underlying performance in our consolidated net sales by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on period-to-period comparability given the volatility in foreign currency exchange markets. To present this information for historical periods, current period net sales for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar are translated into U.S. Dollars at the average monthly exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year rather than at the actual average monthly exchange rate in effect during the current period of the current fiscal year. As a result, the foreign currency impact is equal to the current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in average foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. 
 
 Cash and Marketable Securities 
 
 The Company combines the Cash and cash equivalent financial statement line item and the Marketable securities financial statement line item as an aggregate total as reconciled in the liquidity and capital resource section below. The Company s management believes that this presentation provides useful information to management, analysts and investors regarding certain additional financial and business trends relating to its short-term liquidity position by combining these three GAAP metrics. 

35

Operating Metrics and Non-GAAP Measures 
 
 We use the following operating metrics and non-GAAP measures to evaluate our business and operations, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, project our future performance, and make strategic decisions. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate operating metrics and non-GAAP measures with similar names differently which may reduce their usefulness as comparative measures. Certain variances are labeled as not meaningful ("NM") throughout management's discussion and analysis.

Revenue from Canadian medical cannabis: Revenue from Canadian medical cannabis decreased to 6.1 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023, compared to revenue of 6.5 million for the prior year same period. On a constant currency basis revenue from Canadian medical cannabis decreased to 6.3 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023, compared to revenue of 6.5 million for the prior year same periods. While revenue was relatively consistent period over period and on a constant currency basis, the decrease in revenue from medical cannabis continues to be driven by increased competition from the adult-use recreational market and its related price compression impacting the medical cannabis market. 
 
 Revenue from Canadian adult-use cannabis: During the three months ended August 31, 2023, our revenue from Canadian adult-use cannabis increased to 71.2 million compared to revenue of 58.4 million and for the prior year same period. The increase in adult-use revenue was driven by organic growth from launching new product innovations from our existing brand portfolios as well as the increased revenue from the acquisition of HEXO on June 22, 2023, and Truss on August 3, 2023. Additionally, due to the decline in the Canadian dollar, on a constant currency basis, our revenue from Canadian adult-use cannabis increased to 73.1 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023. Offsetting the increase in the current period, was the reduction of advisory services revenue to 1.5 million from 7.8 million in the prior year comparative period as a result of the HEXO acquisition being completed during the quarter which terminated the previous strategic arrangement that was in place. 
 
 Wholesale cannabis revenue: Revenue from wholesale cannabis increased to 5.3 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023, compared to revenue of 0.4 million for the prior year same period. On a constant currency basis, revenue from wholesale cannabis increased to 5.5 million. The Company continues to believe that wholesale cannabis revenue will remain subject to quarter-to-quarter variability and is based on opportunistic sales. The wholesale transactions that occurred in the period aided with our liquidity initiatives to increase our cash flow from operations despite having unfavorable impacts on our gross margin and EBITDA of (2.7) million. 
 
 International cannabis revenue: Revenue from international cannabis increased to 14.3 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023, compared to revenue of 10.4 million for the prior year same period. Given the increase of the Euro against the U.S. Dollar when compared to the prior year quarter, on a constant currency basis, revenue from international cannabis was 13.8 million compared to 10.4 million in the prior year same period for the three months ended August 31, 2023. The increase in the period is largely driven by expansion into emerging international medical markets. 

39

Distribution revenue 
 
 Revenue from Distribution operations increased to 69.2 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023 compared to revenue of 60.6 million for the prior year same period. Revenue was positively impacted during the three month period from the increase of the Euro against the U.S. Dollar in the quarter, which when the impacts are eliminated on a constant currency basis, revenue was 67.0 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023. The increase in the period was driven by increased production capacity achieved through out-sourcing to third party production facilities as well as leveraging our own internal production and improved procurement processes, which has allowed CC Pharma to improve its product mix. 
 
 Beverage alcohol revenue 
 
 Revenue from our Beverage alcohol operations increased to 24.2 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023, compared to revenue of 20.7 million for the prior year same period. The increase in the three month period relates primarily to our acquisition of Montauk which occurred on November 7, 2022, and is not reflected in the prior year comparative period. 
 
 Wellness revenue 
 
 Our Wellness revenue from Manitoba Harvest was relatively consistent at 13.3 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023 compared to 13.4 million from the prior year same period. On a constant currency basis for the three months ended August 31, 2023, Wellness revenue increased to 13.5 million from 13.4 million. Overall, sales remained relatively consistent period over period despite increasing pricing when compared to prior year to combat the inflation of ingredient costs.

 Adjusted gross profit is our Gross profit (adjusted to exclude purchase price accounting valuation step-up) and adjusted gross margin is our Gross margin (adjusted to exclude purchase price accounting valuation step-up) and are non-GAAP financial measures. See Use of Non-GAAP Measures below for additional discussion regarding these non-GAAP measures. The Company s management believes that adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin are useful to our management to evaluate our business and operations, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, project our future performance, and make strategic decisions. We do not consider adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP.

Cannabis gross margin: Gross margin decreased during the three months ended August 31, 2023 to 28 from 51 for the prior year same period. Excluding the impact of the non-cash fair value purchase price accounting step-up, adjusted gross margin during the three months ended August 31, 2023 decreased to 35 from 51 when comparing the same prior year period. The remaining decrease is a result of the termination of the HEXO advisory services agreement which contributed 1.5 million of gross profit in the current year compared to 7.8 million in the prior year and a significant wholesale transaction with a negative gross profit of (2.7) million, which was entered into to optimize our inventory levels and prioritize the generation of positive operating cash flow. Combining these factors, adjusted gross cannabis margin would have been 39 compared 43 in the prior period and the remaining decrease in gross margin is due to price compression. 
 
 Distribution gross margin: Gross margin of 11 for the three months ended August 31, 2023 increased from 9 for the same periods in the prior year. The increase in the three month period is attributed to a change in product mix as the Company continues to focus on higher margin sales and a decrease in its cost of goods driven by the outsourcing of production. 
 
 Beverage alcohol gross margin: Gross margin of 53 for the three months ended August 31, 2023 increased from 47 from the same period in the prior year. Adjusted gross margin of 56 for the three months ended August 31, 2023 increased from 53 from the same periods in the prior year. The increase in beverage alcohol gross margin for the current three month period is a result of a change in sales mix between beer and spirits as well as the impacts of the Montauk acquisition that was not completed in the prior period comparison. 
 
 Wellness gross margin: Gross margin of 29 for the three months ended August 31, 2023 increased from 26 from the same period in the prior year. The increase in gross margin is a result of increased pricing from the prior period, which was used to combat the impacts of higher input costs of seed ingredients as a result of inflation.

Executive compensation increased by 3 in the three months ended August 31, 2023. Executive compensation has remained generally consistent period over period. 
 
 Office and general increased by 40 during the three months ended August 31, 2023. The increase for the three months is a result of the acquisition of Montauk and HEXO, which did not occur in the prior period. 
 
 Salaries and wages decreased by 10 during the three months ended August 31, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to our focus on optimizing our cost structure and is offset by the inclusion of Montauk and HEXO employees, which were not in the prior period. 

44

The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of 8.3 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023 compared to 9.2 million for the same period in the prior year. The balance has remained relatively consistent period over period as this is based on the time-based vesting schedules. 
 
 Insurance expenses increased by 42 for the three months ended August 31, 2023 to 3.8 million from 2.7 million for the same period in the prior year. This increase was driven by the expanded polices required for our recently acquired HEXO and Montauk entities. 
 
 Selling costs 
 
 For the three months ended August 31, 2023, the Company incurred selling costs of 6.9 million or 3.9 of net revenue as compared to 9.7 million and 6.3 of net revenue in the prior year period. These costs relate to third-party distributor commissions, shipping costs, Health Canada cannabis fees, and patient acquisition and maintenance costs. Patient acquisition and ongoing patient maintenance costs include funding to individual clinics to assist with additional costs incurred by clinics resulting from the education of patients using the Company s products. The decrease in the three month period was related to the renegotiation of terms in one of our distributor relationships resulting in reduced variable fees. This impact was also emphasized in the three month period as a portion of our selling fees related to our Canadian adult-use cannabis with fixed components did not increase with the increase in our revenue during the quarter. 
 
 Amortization 
 
 The Company incurred non-production related amortization charges of 22.2 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023 compared to 24.4 million in the prior year period. The decreased amortization in the period, is a result of the reduced intangible asset levels. 
 
 Marketing and promotion costs 
 
 For the three months ended August 31, 2023, the Company incurred marketing and promotion costs of 8.5 million as compared to 7.2 million for the prior year period. The increase is due to the acquisition of HEXO and Montauk in the period. 
 
 Research and development 
 
 Research and development costs were 0.1 million during the three months ended August 31, 2023 compared to 0.2 million in the prior year period. These relate to external costs associated with the development of new products. 
 
 Change in fair value of contingent consideration 
 
 The Company measures contingent consideration at fair value classified as Level 3, as discussed in Note 23 (Fair value measurements). The Company currently has three contingent consideration liabilities of 3.0 million, 13.0 million and 4.2 million for the Sweetwater, Montauk, and Truss acquisitions, respectively, as of August 31, 2023 compared to 16.2 million, 10.9 million and nil respectively as of May 31, 2023. The decrease in fair value of 11.1 million was driven by the lowered probability of achieving the incentive targets, primarily relating to Sweetwater. 

45

Litigation 
 
 For the three months ended August 31, 2023, the Company recorded 2.0 million of litigation cost compared to an expense of 0.4 million for the prior period comparative. The increase is related to period to period variability as litigation is non-recurring in nature. 
 
 Restructuring costs 
 
 In connection with executing our acquisition strategy and strategic transactions, the Company has incurred non-recurring restructuring and exit costs associated with the integration efforts of these transactions. For the three months ended August 31, 2023, the Company incurred 0.9 million of restructuring costs compared to nil for the prior period comparative. The restructuring charges for the three months ended August 31, 2023 are related to the HEXO cost optimizations occurring subsequent to acquisition and the operating costs of the Truss facility, which is classified as assets held for sale. 
 
 Transaction (income) costs 
 
 Items classified as transaction (income) costs are non-recurring or extraordinary in nature and correspond largely to our acquisition and synergy strategy. The three months decrease of 166 from the prior year period is related to the following items: 

the current period included costs associated with exit and closing costs on completing the HEXO Acquisition on June 22, 2023, including, but not limited to, discretionary incentive compensation payments of 5.8 million, transaction income from the loan amendment agreement of (6.0) million, and HEXO director and office runoff insurance of 5.1 million; 

in the prior year period comparative, we recognized transaction income for a change in fair value of 18.3 million on the HTI Share Consideration s purchase price derivative as a result of an increase in our share price on the shares paid for the HEXO convertible note receivable in the previous year. This did not recur in the current period results.

For the three months ended August 31, 2023, the Company recognized a change in fair value of its convertible debentures payable of 2.1) million compared to 7.9) million in the prior year same periods. The change is driven primarily by the changes in the Company s share price and the change in the trading price of the convertible debentures payable. Additionally, for the three months ended August 31, 2023, the Company recognized a change in fair value of its warrants, resulting in a loss of 8.2) million compared to 1.5 million also as a result of the change in our share price and the exercise price of the instrument. For the three months ended August 31, 2023, the Company recognized a gain of 6.3 million, resulting from the changes in foreign exchange rates during the period, compared to losses of 25.6) million for the prior year same periods, largely associated with the recovery of the Euro. Lastly, included in other non-operating (losses) gains, net for the three months ended August 31, 2023 was the disposal of an operating entity during the period. 
 
 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Measures 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The Company calculates adjusted EBITDA as net loss/net income before income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization, equity in net loss of equity-method investees, non-cash inventory valuation adjustments, purchase price accounting step-up on inventory, stock-based compensation, integration activities, transaction (income) costs, litigation costs, change in fair value of contingent consideration, unrealized currency gains and losses and other adjustments. 
 
 We believe that this presentation provides useful information to management, analysts and investors regarding certain additional financial and business trends relating to its results of operations and financial condition. In addition, management uses this measure for reviewing the financial results of the Company and as a component of performance-based executive compensation. 
 
 We do not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of Adjusted EBITDA is that it excludes certain expenses and income that are required by U.S. GAAP to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is subject to inherent limitations as this metric reflects the exercise of judgment by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining Adjusted EBITDA. In order to compensate for these limitations, management presents Adjusted EBITDA in connection with GAAP results. 
 
 For three months ended August 31, 2023, adjusted EBITDA decreased to 11.4 million compared to 13.5 million from the prior year same period. The decrease was primarily driven by the aforementioned negative impacts to our cannabis gross margin.

Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, net loss. There are a number of limitations related to the use of Adjusted EBITDA as compared to net loss, the closest comparable GAAP measure. Adjusted EBITDA adjusts for the following: 

Non-cash inventory valuation adjustments; 

Non-cash amortization and amortization expenses and, although these are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future; 

Stock-based compensation expenses, a non-cash expense and are an important part of our compensation strategy; 

Non-cash impairment charges, as the charges are not expected to be a recurring business activity; 

Non-cash foreign exchange gains or losses, which accounts for the effect of both realized and unrealized foreign exchange transactions. Unrealized gains or losses represent foreign exchange revaluation of foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities; 

Non-cash change in fair value of warrant liability; 

Interest expense, net; 

Costs incurred to start up new facilities, and to fund emerging market operations for our German cultivation facilities and Columbian operations. The prior period also included start up costs for SweetWater Colorado and Malta facilities; 

Lease expense, to conform with competitors who report under IFRS;

Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin 
 
 Adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin are non-GAAP financial measures and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Adjusted gross profit is our Gross profit (adjusted to exclude purchase price accounting valuation step-up) and adjusted gross margin is our Gross margin (adjusted to exclude purchase price accounting valuation step-up) and are non-GAAP financial measures. The Company s management believes that adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin are useful to our management to evaluate our business and operations, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, project our future performance, and make strategic decisions. We do not consider adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin percentage in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, and complete acquisitions. We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs for a short and long term outlook. 
 
 For the Company's short-term liquidity requirements, we are focused on generating positive cash flows from operations and being free cash flow positive. As a result of delays in legalization across multiple markets, management continues to optimize our operating structure, headcount, as well as the elimination of other discretionary operational costs. Some of these actions may be less accretive to our adjusted EBITDA in the short term, however we believe that they will be required for our liquidity aspirations in the near term future. Additionally, the Company continues to invest our excess cash in the short-term in marketable securities which are comprised of U.S. treasury bills and term deposits with major Canadian banks. 
 
 For the Company's long-term liquidity requirements, we will be focused on funding operations through profitable organic and inorganic growth through acquisitions. We may need to take on additional debt or equity financing arrangements in order to achieve these ambitions on a long-term basis. 
 
 The following table sets forth the major components of our statements of cash flows for the periods presented:

 Cash and marketable securities are non-GAAP financial measures. See Use of Non-GAAP Measures below for additional discussion regarding these non-GAAP measures. The Company combines the Cash and cash equivalent financial statement line item, and the Marketable securities financial statement line item as an aggregate total as reconciled in the liquidity and capital resource section below. The Company s management believes that this presentation provides useful information to management, analysts and investors regarding certain additional financial and business trends relating to its short-term liquidity position by combing these three GAAP metrics.

Cash flows from operating activities 
 
 The change in net cash used in operating activities was 15.8) million for three months ended August 31, 2023 compared to 46.3) million for the prior year same period. This decrease in cash used in the three month period was primarily related to improved operating efficiencies and increased management of our working capital requirements. 
 
 Cash flows from investing activities 
 
 The change in net cash used in investing activities was 26.3) million for three months ended August 31, 2023 compared to 1.5) million for the prior year same period, and is a result of investing in marketable securities partially offset by cash acquired from the HEXO Acquisition, Note 6 (Business acquisitions). 
 
 Cash flows from financing activities 
 
 The change in cash provided by financing activities was 14.0 million for three months ended August 31, 2023 compared to 123.6 million for the prior year same period.

 Subsequent Events 
 
 Refer to Part I, Financial Information, Note 25 Subsequent Events. 
 
 Contingencies 
 
 In addition to the litigation described in the Part II, Item 1 - Legal Proceedings, the Company is and may be a defendant in lawsuits from time to time in the normal course of business. While the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes the reasonably possible losses of such matters, individually and in the aggregate, are not material. Additionally, the Company believes the probable final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated results of operations, financial position, cash flows or liquidity. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The accounting principles we use require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods presented. We believe in the quality and reasonableness of our critical accounting policies; however, materially different amounts may be reported under different conditions or using assumptions different from those that we have applied. The accounting estimates that have been identified as critical to our business operations and to understanding the results of our operations pertain to revenue recognition, valuation of inventory, valuation of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets, stock-based compensation and valuation allowances for deferred tax assets. The application of each of these critical accounting policies and estimates is discussed in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2023. 
 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 A description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations is disclosed in Part I, Item 1. Note 1 Basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 There have been no material changes in market risk from those addressed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2023 during the three months ended August 31, 2023. See the information set forth in Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, and summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report was made under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. 
 
 Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of May 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures (a) are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is timely recorded, processed, summarized and reported and (b) include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Consistent with guidance issued by the SEC, the scope of management s assessment of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures did not include the internal controls over financial reporting of Montauk Brewing Company, Inc., which we acquired on November 7, 2022, of HEXO Corp., which we acquired June 22, 2023 and of Truss Beverage Co. which we acquired August 3, 2023, and represented 1.3 , 3.2 and 0.3 of our consolidated assets and 1.5 , 7 and 0.9 of our consolidated revenues respectively as of and for the three months ended August 31, 2023. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. As mentioned above, the Company acquired Montauk Brewing Company, Inc. on November 7, 2022, HEXO Corp. on June 22, 2023 and Truss Beverage Co., on August 3, 2023. The Company is in the process of reviewing the internal control structure of Montauk Brewing Company, Inc., HEXO Corp., and Truss Beverage Co., if necessary, will make appropriate changes as it integrates them into the Company s overall internal control over financial reporting process.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, we are at times subject to various legal proceedings and disputes, including the proceedings specifically discussed below. We assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings utilizing the latest information available. Where it is probable that we will incur a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements. These legal reserves may be increased or decreased to reflect any relevant developments on a quarterly basis. Where a loss is not probable or the amount of loss is not estimable, we do not accrue legal reserves. While the outcome of legal proceedings is inherently uncertain, based on information currently available, our management believes that it has established appropriate legal reserves. Any liabilities arising from pending legal proceedings are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations, or consolidated cash flows. However, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to our consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations, or consolidated cash flows. 
 
 Item 3. Legal Proceedings of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2023 includes a discussion of our legal proceedings. There have been no material changes from the legal proceedings described in our Form 10-K, except with respect to the matters disclosed and incorporated herein by reference to Note 18 (Commitments and contingencies), in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 

53

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2023 includes a discussion of our known material risk factors, other than risks that could apply to any issuer or offering. A summary of our risk factors is included below. Except for the below risk factors, there have been no material changes from the risk factors described in our Form 10-K. 

We may not achieve the expected revenue or other benefits from the craft beer operations acquired from Anheuser-Busch. 

Additional impairments of our goodwill, impairments of our intangible and other long-lived assets, and changes in the estimated useful lives of intangible assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. 

We may experience difficulties integrating Tilray and HEXO s operations and realizing the expected benefits of the Arrangement. 

Our business is dependent upon regulatory approvals and licenses, ongoing compliance and reporting obligations, and timely renewals. 

Government regulation is evolving, and unfavorable changes or lack of commercial legalization could impact our ability to carry on our business as currently conducted and the potential expansion of our business. 

Our production and processing facilities are integral to our business and adverse changes or developments affecting our facilities may have an adverse impact on our business. 

We face intense competition, and anticipate competition will increase, which could hurt our business. 

Regulations constrain our ability to market and distribute our products in Canada. 

United States regulations relating to hemp-derived CBD products are new and rapidly evolving, and changes may not develop in the timeframe or manner most favorable to our business objectives. 

Changes in consumer preferences or public attitudes about alcohol could decrease demand for our beverage alcohol products. 

SweetWater, Breckenridge and Montauk each face substantial competition in the beer industry or the broader market for alcoholic beverage products which could impact our business and financial results. 

We have a limited operating history and a history of net losses, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. 

We are subject to litigation, arbitration and demands, which could result in significant liability and costs, and impact our resources and reputation. 

Our strategic alliances and other third-party business relationships may not achieve the intended beneficial impact and expose us to risks. 

We may not be able to successfully identify and execute future acquisitions, dispositions or other equity transactions or to successfully manage the impacts of such transactions on our operations. 

We are subject to risks inherent in an agricultural business, including the risk of crop failure. 

We depend on significant customers for a substantial portion of our revenue. If we fail to retain or expand our customer relationships or significant customers reduce their purchases, our revenue could decline significantly. 

Our products may be subject to recalls for a variety of reasons, which could require us to expend significant management and capital resources. 

Significant interruptions in our access to certain supply chains for key inputs such as raw materials, supplies, electricity, water and other utilities may impair our operations. 

Management may not be able to successfully establish and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting. 

The price of our common stock in public markets has experienced and may continue to experience severe volatility and fluctuations. 

The volatility of our stock and the stockholder base may hinder or prevent us from engaging in beneficial corporate initiatives. 

The terms of our outstanding warrants may limit our ability to raise additional equity capital or pursue acquisitions, which may impact funding of our ongoing operations and cause significant dilution to existing stockholders. 

We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the convertible securities in cash or to repurchase the convertible securities upon a fundamental change. 

We are subject to other risks generally applicable to our industry and the conduct of our business. 

We may experience difficulties achieving the expected benefits, including revenue and sales growth, of acquiring certain craft beer operations from Anheuser-Busch (the ABI Acquisitions ). 
 
 The success of the ABI Acquisitions will depend in part on our ability to achieve the expected business opportunities, revenue and sales growth prospects from the ABI Acquisitions in an efficient and effective manner. We may also not be able to fully realize the operational efficiencies and associated cost synergies or leverage the potential business opportunities and growth prospects to the extent anticipated or at all. 
 
 The ABI Acquisitions were completed on September 29, 2023. Efforts to achieve expected benefits of the ABI Acquisitions may require substantial resources and divert management attention. Challenges associated with achieving such benefits may include those related to sales and marketing efforts across our expanded product portfolio, operational efficiency and production optimization, and effectively integrating the ABI Acquisitions into Tilray. If we are unable to successfully integrate certain aspects of the operations of the ABI Acquisitions or experience delays, we may incur unanticipated liabilities and be unable to fully realize the potential benefit of the revenue growth, synergies and other anticipated benefits resulting from the arrangement, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Some of these factors are outside our control, and any of them could delay or increase the cost of our efforts.

The restrictions on transfer set forth herein will lapse upon delivery to you of shares in respect of your vested Restricted Stock Units. 

(a) Death . Your Award is transferable by will and by the laws of descent and distribution.

Upon receiving written permission from the Board or its duly authorized designee, and provided that you and the designated transferee enter into transfer and other agreements required by the Company, you may transfer your right to receive the distribution of Common Stock or other consideration hereunder, pursuant to a domestic relations order, marital settlement agreement or other divorce or separation instrument as permitted by applicable law that contains the information required by the Company to effectuate the transfer. You are encouraged to discuss the proposed terms of any division of this Award with the Company General Counsel prior to finalizing the domestic relations order or marital settlement agreement to verify that you may make such transfer, and if so, to help ensure the required information is contained within the domestic relations order or marital settlement agreement. 

6. DATE OF ISSUANCE. 

(a) The issuance of shares in respect of the Restricted Stock Units is intended to be exempt under Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) and will be construed and administered in such a manner. Subject to the satisfaction of the Withholding Obligation set forth in Section 11 of this Agreement, in the event one or more Restricted Stock Units vests, the Company shall issue to you one (1) share of Common Stock for each Restricted Stock Unit that vests on the applicable vesting date(s) (subject to any adjustment under Section 3 above, and subject to any different provisions in the Grant Notice). Each issuance date determined by this paragraph is referred to as an Original Issuance Date . 

(b) If the Original Issuance Date falls on a date that is not a business day, delivery shall instead occur on the next following business day. In addition, if: 

(i) the Original Issuance Date does not occur (1) during an open window period applicable to you, as determined by the Company in accordance with the Company s then-effective policy on trading in Company securities, or (2) on a date when you are otherwise permitted to sell shares of Common Stock on an established stock exchange or stock market (including but not limited to under a previously established written trading plan that meets the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act and was entered into in compliance with the Company s policies (a 10b5-1 Arrangement )), and 

(ii) either (1) a Withholding Obligation does not apply, or (2) the Company decides, prior to the Original Issuance Date, (A) not to satisfy the Withholding Obligation by withholding shares of Common Stock from the shares otherwise due, on the Original Issuance Date, to you under this Award, and (B) not to permit you to enter into a same day sale commitment with a broker-dealer pursuant to Section 11 of this Agreement (including but not limited to a commitment under a 10b5-1 Arrangement) and (C) not to permit you to pay your Withholding Obligation in cash, then the shares that would otherwise be issued to you on the Original Issuance Date will not be delivered on such Original Issuance Date and will instead be delivered on the first business day when you are not prohibited from selling shares of the Company s Common Stock in the open public market, but in no event later than December 31 of the calendar year in which the Original Issuance Date occurs (that is, the last day of your taxable year in which the Original Issuance Date occurs), or, if and only if permitted in a manner that complies with Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(4), no later than the date that is the 15th day of the third calendar month of the applicable year following the year in which the shares of Common Stock under this Award are no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(d). 

(c) The form of delivery e.g. , a stock certificate or electronic entry evidencing such shares) shall be determined by the Company. 

7. DIVIDENDS. You shall receive no benefit or adjustment to your Award with respect to any cash dividend, stock dividend or other distribution that does not result from a Capitalization Adjustment; provided, however, that this sentence will not apply with respect to any shares of Common Stock that are delivered to you in connection with your Award after such shares have been delivered to you. 

8. RESTRICTIVE LEGENDS. The shares of Common Stock issued in respect of your Award shall be endorsed with appropriate legends as determined by the Company. 

9. EXECUTION OF DOCUMENTS. You hereby acknowledge and agree that the manner selected by the Company by which you indicate your consent to your Grant Notice is also deemed to be your execution of your Grant Notice and of this Agreement. You further agree that such manner of indicating consent may be relied upon as your signature for establishing your execution of any documents to be executed in the future in connection with your Award. 

10. AWARD NOT A SERVICE CONTRACT . 

(a) Nothing in this Agreement (including, but not limited to, the vesting of your Award or the issuance of the shares in respect of your Award), the Plan or any covenant of good faith and fair dealing that may be found implicit in this Agreement or the Plan shall: (i) confer upon you any right to continue in the employ or service of, or affiliation with, the Company or an Affiliate; (ii) constitute any promise or commitment by the Company or an Affiliate regarding the fact or nature of future positions, future work assignments, future compensation or any other term or condition of employment or affiliation; (iii) confer any right or benefit under this Agreement or the Plan unless such right or benefit has specifically accrued under the terms of this Agreement or Plan; or (iv) deprive the Company of the right to terminate you at will and without regard to any future vesting opportunity that you may have. 

(b) By accepting this Award, you acknowledge and agree that the right to continue vesting in the Award pursuant to the vesting schedule provided in the Grant Notice may not be earned unless (in addition to any other conditions described in the Grant Notice and this Agreement) you continue as an employee, director or consultant at the will of the Company and affiliate, as applicable (not through the act of being hired, being granted this Award or any other award or benefit) and that the Company has the right to reorganize, sell, spin-out or otherwise restructure one or more of its businesses or Affiliates at any time or from time to time, as it deems appropriate (a reorganization ). You acknowledge and agree that such a reorganization could result in the termination of your Continuous Service, or the termination of Affiliate status of your employer and the loss of benefits available to you under this Agreement, including but not limited to, the termination of the right to continue vesting in the Award. You further acknowledge and agree that this Agreement, the Plan, the transactions contemplated hereunder and the vesting schedule set forth herein or any covenant of good faith and fair dealing that may be found implicit in any of them do not constitute an express or implied promise of continued engagement as an employee or consultant for the term of this Agreement, for any period, or at all, and shall not interfere in any way with the Company s right to terminate your Continuous Service at any time, with or without your cause or notice, or to conduct a reorganization. 

11. WITHHOLDING OBLIGATION. 

(a) On each vesting date, and on or before the time you receive a distribution of the shares of Common Stock in respect of your Restricted Stock Units, and at any other time as reasonably requested by the Company in accordance with applicable tax laws, you hereby authorize any required withholding from the Common Stock issuable to you and/or otherwise agree to make adequate provision, including in cash, for any sums required to satisfy the federal, state, local and foreign tax withholding obligations of the Company or any Affiliate that arise in connection with your Award (the Withholding Obligation ). 

(b) By accepting this Award, you acknowledge and agree that the Company or any Affiliate may, in its sole discretion, satisfy all or any portion of the Withholding Obligation relating to your Restricted Stock Units by any of the following means or by a combination of such means: (i) causing you to pay any portion of the Withholding Obligation in cash; (ii) withholding from any compensation otherwise payable to you by the Company; (iii) withholding shares of Common Stock from the shares of Common Stock issued or otherwise issuable to you in connection with the Award with a Fair Market Value (measured as of the date shares of Common Stock are issued pursuant to Section 6) equal to the amount of such Withholding Obligation; provided, however, that the number of such shares of Common Stock so withheld will not exceed the amount necessary to satisfy the Withholding Obligation using the maximum statutory withholding rates for federal, state, local and foreign tax purposes, including payroll taxes, that are applicable to supplemental taxable income; and provided , further, that to the extent necessary to qualify for an exemption from application of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, if applicable, such share withholding procedure will be subject to the express prior approval of the Board or the Company s Compensation Committee; and/or (iv) permitting or requiring you to enter into a same day sale commitment, if applicable, with a broker-dealer that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (a FINRA Dealer ), pursuant to this authorization and without further consent, whereby you irrevocably elect to sell a portion of the shares to be delivered in connection with your Restricted Stock Units to satisfy the Withholding Obligation and whereby the FINRA Dealer irrevocably commits to forward the proceeds necessary to satisfy the Withholding Obligation directly to the Company and/or its Affiliates. Unless the Withholding Obligation is satisfied, the Company shall have no obligation to deliver to you any Common Stock or any other consideration pursuant to this Award. 

(c) In the event the Withholding Obligation arises prior to the delivery to you of Common Stock or it is determined after the delivery of Common Stock to you that the amount of the Withholding Obligation was greater than the amount withheld by the Company, you agree to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any failure by the Company to withhold the proper amount. 

12. TAX CONSEQUENCES. The Company has no duty or obligation to minimize the tax consequences to you of this Award and shall not be liable to you for any adverse tax consequences to you arising in connection with this Award. You are hereby advised to consult with your own personal tax, financial and/or legal advisors regarding the tax consequences of this Award and by signing the Grant Notice, you have agreed that you have done so or knowingly and voluntarily declined to do so. You understand that you (and not the Company) shall be responsible for your own tax liability that may arise as a result of this investment or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

13. UNSECURED OBLIGATION. Your Award is unfunded, and as a holder of a vested Award, you shall be considered an unsecured creditor of the Company with respect to the Company s obligation, if any, to issue shares or other property pursuant to this Agreement. You shall not have voting or any other rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to the shares to be issued pursuant to this Agreement until such shares are issued to you pursuant to Section 6 of this Agreement. Upon such issuance, you will obtain full voting and other rights as a stockholder of the Company. Nothing contained in this Agreement, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, shall create or be construed to create a trust of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between you and the Company or any other person. 

14. NOTICES . Any notice or request required or permitted hereunder shall be given in writing (including electronically) and will be deemed effectively given upon receipt or, in the case of notices delivered by mail by the Company to you, five (5) days after deposit in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to you at the last address you provided to the Company.

17. GOVERNING PLAN DOCUMENT . Your Award is subject to all the provisions of the Plan, the provisions of which are hereby made a part of your Award, and is further subject to all interpretations, amendments, rules and regulations which may from time to time be promulgated and adopted pursuant to the Plan.

18. EFFECT ON OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. The value of the Award subject to this Agreement shall not be included as compensation, earnings, salaries, or other similar terms used when calculating benefits under any employee benefit plan (other than the Plan) sponsored by the Company or any Affiliate except as such plan otherwise expressly provides.

21. AMENDMENT. This Agreement may not be modified, amended or terminated except by an instrument in writing, signed by you and by a duly authorized representative of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be amended solely by the Board by a writing which specifically states that it is amending this Agreement, so long as a copy of such amendment is delivered to you, and provided that, except as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, no such amendment materially adversely affecting your rights hereunder may be made without your written consent. Without limiting the foregoing, the Board reserves the right to change, by written notice to you, the provisions of this Agreement in any way it may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purpose of the Award as a result of any change in applicable laws or regulations or any future law, regulation, ruling, or judicial decision, provided that any such change shall be applicable only to rights relating to that portion of the Award which is then subject to restrictions as provided herein.

This Award is intended to be exempt from the application of Section 409A of the Code, including but not limited to by reason of complying with the short-term deferral rule set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) and any ambiguities herein shall be interpreted accordingly. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if it is determined that the Award fails to satisfy the requirements of the short-term deferral rule and is otherwise not exempt from, and determined to be deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, this Award shall comply with Section 409A to the extent necessary to avoid adverse personal tax consequences and any ambiguities herein shall be interpreted accordingly. If it is determined that the Award is deferred compensation subject to Section 409A and you are a Specified Employee (within the meaning set forth in Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code) as of the date of your Separation from Service (as defined in Section 409A), then the issuance of any shares that would otherwise be made upon the date of your Separation from Service or within the first six (6) months thereafter will not be made on the originally scheduled date(s) and will instead be issued in a lump sum on the date that is six (6) months and one day after the date of the Separation from Service, with the balance of the shares issued thereafter in accordance with the original vesting and issuance schedule set forth above, but if and only if such delay in the issuance of the shares is necessary to avoid the imposition of adverse taxation on you in respect of the shares under Section 409A of the Code. Each installment of shares that vests is intended to constitute a separate payment for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2). 

This Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement shall be deemed to be signed by the Company and the Participant upon the signing by the Participant of the Restricted Stock Unit Grant Notice to which it is attached.
