FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this "Quarterly Report") contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), that are based on the views and beliefs of management of American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. (the "Company," "AEO," "we," "us," and "our"), as well as assumptions and estimates made by management. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and we do not intend to correct or update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. Actual results could differ materially from such forward-looking statements as a result of various risk factors, including those contained in this Quarterly Report and in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on March 15, 2024 (the "Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K") that may not be in the control of management. Our fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31. As used herein, "Fiscal 2024" refers to the 52-week period that will end on February 1, 2025. "Fiscal 2023" refers to the 53-week period ended February 3, 2024. 
 All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report are forward-looking statements. Words such as "estimate," "project," "plan," "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "potential," and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about: 
 the planned opening of approximately five to 15 American Eagle stores and approximately 25 to 40 Aerie and OFFLINE stores, which will be a mix of stand-alone and Aerie side-by-sides, during Fiscal 2024; 

the anticipated selection of approximately 80 to 90 American Eagle and Aerie stores in North America for remodeling during Fiscal 2024; 

the potential closure of approximately 10 to 20 American Eagle stores at the expiration of their lease term, primarily in North America, during Fiscal 2024; 

the success of our core American Eagle and Aerie brands through our omni-channel and licensed outlets within North America and internationally; 

the success of our business priorities and strategies; 

the continued validity of our trademarks; 

our performance during the holiday selling season; 

the reduction of operating expenses and capital expenditures, including through our profit improvement program, and impact on our results of operations; 

the accuracy of the estimates and assumptions we make pursuant to our critical accounting policies and estimates; 

the payment of a dividend in future periods; 

our ability to fund our current and long-term cash requirements through current cash holdings and available liquidity, including under our revolving credit facility; 

the possibility that product costs are adversely affected by foreign trade issues (including import tariffs and other trade restrictions imposed by the United States ("U.S."), China or other countries), currency exchange rate fluctuations, increasing prices for raw materials, supply chain issues, political instability or other reasons; 

the possibility of changes in global economic and financial conditions, and resulting impacts on consumer confidence and consumer spending, as well as other changes in consumer discretionary spending habits; 

the effect of inflation on our business; 

the possibility that we may be required to take additional impairment or other restructuring charges; 

the impact of any macroeconomic or geopolitical conditions; and 

the ability of our distribution centers and stores to maintain adequate staffing to meet increased customer demand. 

Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: 
 4 

the risk that general macroeconomic conditions, including the effect of inflationary economic pressures and other business factors, will continue to negatively impact discretionary consumer spending and adversely impact our revenues and/or margins; 

the risk that foreign policy changes resulting from the presidential and congressional elections in the US and the foreign policy of other jurisdictions in which we conduct business, including threatened and actual changes in tariffs or other trade restrictions, uncertainty regarding international trade agreements, immigration policy, and defense and security policy, could adversely impact our business, our financial condition, and the results of operations ; 

the risk that our inability to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences and fashion trends and fluctuations in consumer demand in a timely manner could adversely impact our business and results of operations; 

the risk that seasonality may cause sales to fluctuate and negatively impact our results of operations; 

the risks associated with operating in a highly competitive industry, and with facing significant pricing pressures from existing and new competitors; 

the risk that our results could be adversely affected by events beyond our control, such as natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, negative global climate patterns, or other catastrophic events; 

the risk that impairments of goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets, including impairments relating to our Quiet Platforms business, could adversely impact our profitability; 

the risk that our inability to grow and optimize our digital channels and leverage omni-channel capabilities could adversely impact tour business; 

the risk that failure to define, launch and communicate a brand-relevant customer experience could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability; 

the risk that our inability to execute on our key business priorities could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability; 

the inherent risks of operating in other countries from our current international operations and efforts to further expand internationally; 

the risk that failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brands; 

the risk that failure to manage growth in our omni-channel operations and the resulting impact on our distribution and fulfillment networks may have an adverse effect on our results of operations; 

the risks that our inability to implement and sustain adequate information technology systems could adversely impact our profitability and that the loss or disruption of information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business; 

the risks related to our electronic processing of sensitive and confidential personal and business data, including as a result of cyberattacks, data breaches, other security incidents, or disruption of information technology systems or software; 

the risk that our inability to achieve targeted store performance, gain market share in the face of declining shopping center traffic or attract customers to our stores could adversely impact our profitability and our results of operations; 

the risk that failure to properly manage and allocate our inventory could have an adverse effect on our business, sales, margins, financial condition, and results of operations; 

the risks associated with our significant lease obligations and with leasing substantial amounts of space, including future increases in occupancy costs and the need to generate significant cash flow to meet our lease obligations; 

the risks associated with our reliance on key personnel, the loss of whom could have a material adverse effect on our business; 

the risk that increases in labor costs, including wages, could adversely impact our operational results, financial condition and results of operations; 

the risks that the current legal and regulatory environment, or changes to the legal and regulatory environment, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations; 

the risk that fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate could adversely affect us; and 

5 

the risk that the unfavorable outcome of pending or future litigation could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 retail stores in the U.S. and internationally, online through our digital channels at www.ae.com, www.aerie.com, www.toddsnyder.com, and www.unsubscribed.com and through more than i nternational store locations managed by third-party operators. Through its portfolio of brands, the Company offers high quality, on-trend clothing, accessories, and personal care products at affordable prices. We sell directly to consumers through our retail channel, which includes our stores and concession-based shop-within-shops. We operate stores in the U.S., Canada, Hong Kong, and Mexico. We also have license agreements with third parties to operate American Eagle and Aerie stores throughout Asia, Europe, India, Latin America, and the Middle East. The Company's online business, AEO Direct, ships to approximately countries worldwide. As e-commerce penetration and growth have normalized coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic, the supply chain landscape has continued to evolve. In Fiscal 2023, as part of its profit improvement program, the Company began to streamline and shift the operations of Quiet Platforms to better align with AEO's long term strategy. As a result of these changes, Quiet Platforms has refined its focus on its core capabilities as a regionalized fulfillment center network. The network and related growth plans have been updated to reflect this refined focus. Historically, our operations have been seasonal, with a large portion of total net revenue and operating income occurring in the third and fourth fiscal quarters, reflecting increased demand during the back-to-school and year-end holiday selling seasons, respectively. Our quarterly results of operations also may fluctuate based upon such factors as the timing of certain holiday seasons, the number and timing of new store openings, the acceptability of seasonal merchandise offerings, the timing and level of markdowns, store closings and remodels, competitive factors, weather and general economic and political conditions. 

. Non-controlling interest is included as a component of contributed capital within the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity and was not material for any period presented. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. At November 2, 2024 , the Company operated in reportable segments, American Eagle and Aerie.

 s Three to s 

As of November 2, 2024, the weighted average remaining useful life of our assets was approximately . In accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment ("ASC 360"), the Company s management evaluates the value of leasehold improvements, store fixtures, and operating lease right-of-use ("ROU") assets associated with retail stores. The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment at the individual store level, which is the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified. Impairment losses are recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the projected undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amounts. When events such as these occur, the impaired assets are adjusted to their estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recorded separately as a component of operating income within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Our impairment loss calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values. The significant assumption used in our fair value analysis is forecasted revenue. We do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, our consolidated operating results could be adversely affected. When the Company closes, remodels, or relocates a store prior to the end of its lease term, the remaining net book value of the assets related to the store is recorded as a write-off of assets within depreciation and amortization expense. Refer to Note 6, Property and Equipment, Net, to the Consolidat ed Financial Statements for additional information regarding property and equipment, and refer to Note 14, Impairment, Restructuring and Other Charges, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the impairment of assets during the 13 and 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023.

million recorded within impairment, restructuring and other charges on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for Fiscal 2023, due to insufficient prospective cash flows to support the carrying value of the business. Significant, subjective assumptions used in the Company s fair value estimate included forecasted cost of sales, forecasted operating expense and the discount rate. indicators of impairment were present during the 13 and 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023. Definite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value, with amortization computed utilizing the straight-line method over the assets estimated useful lives. The Company s definite-lived intangible assets, which consist primarily of trademark assets, are generally amortized over to years. The Company evaluates definite-lived intangible assets for impairment in accordance with ASC 360 when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Such an evaluation includes the estimation of undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by those assets. If the sum of the estimated future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amounts of the assets, then the assets are impaired and are adjusted to their estimated fair value. During Fiscal 2023, the Company recorded a million impairment charge within impairment, restructuring and other charges on the Consolidated Statements of Operations related to the definite-lived intangible assets of Quiet Platforms, due to insufficient prospective cash flows to support the carrying value of the assets. definite-lived intangible asset impairment charges were recorded during the 13 and 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023. Refer to Note 7, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Points earned under the Program on purchases at AE and Aerie are accounted for in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASC 606"). The portion of the sales revenue attributed to the reward points is deferred and recognized when the reward is redeemed or when the points expire, using the relative stand-alone selling price method. Additionally, reward points earned using the co-branded credit card on non-AE or Aerie purchases are accounted for in accordance with ASC 606. As the points are earned, a current liability is recorded for the estimated cost of the reward, and the impact of adjustments is recorded in revenue. The Company defers a portion of the sales revenue attributed to the loyalty points and recognizes revenue when the points are redeemed or expire, consistent with the requirements of ASC 606.

Long-Term Debt As of November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023 , there were outstanding borrowings under the Company's Credit Facility. Refer to Note 8, Long-Term Debt, Net, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding long-term debt and other credit arrangements. Non-Financial Assets The Company s non-financial assets, which include intangible assets and property and equipment, are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. However, if certain triggering events occur and the Company is required to evaluate the non-financial asset for impairment, a resulting impairment would require that the non-financial asset be recorded at the estimated fair value. The fair value is determined by estimating the amount and timing of net future cash flows and discounting them using a risk-adjusted rate of interest. The Company estimates future cash flows based on its experience and knowledge of the market in which the store is located. During the 13 and 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024, t he Company recorded impairment of assets of million related to the pending sale of its Hong Kong retail operations . There were long-lived asset impairment charges recorded during the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023. During the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023 , the Company recorded impairment of property and equipment of million.

 compared to for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023. The change in the effective tax rate, as compared to the prior period, is primarily due to a change in non-deductible executive compensation and international tax provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"). The effective income tax rate for the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024 was compared to for the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023. The change in the effective tax rate, as compared to the prior period, is primarily due to excess tax benefits on share-based payments and tax audit adjustments. The Company records accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense, which were insignificant for both the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023. The Company recognizes income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with ASC 740 and adjusts these liabilities when its judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Unrecognized tax benefits did not change significantly during either the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024 or October 28, 2023. Over the next twelve months, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by approximately million due to settlements, expiration of statute of limitations, or other changes in unrecognized tax benefits, which is expected to have an immaterial impact on the annual effective tax rate.

operating segments (American Eagle brand and Aerie brand) that also represent our reportable segments and reflect the CODM's internal view of analyzing results and allocating resources. Additionally, our Todd Snyder brand, Unsubscribed brand, and Quiet Platforms have been identified as separate operating segments; however, as they do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate disclosure, they are presented under the Other caption, as permitted by ASC 280. General corporate expenses consist of general and administrative costs that management does not attribute to any of our operating segments. These costs primarily relate to corporate administration, information and technology resources, finance and human resources functional and organizational costs, depreciation and amortization of corporate assets, and other general and administrative expenses resulting from corporate-level activities and projects. Our CEO analyzes segment results and allocates resources between segments based on the adjusted operating income, or the operating income in periods where there are no adjustments, of each segment. Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure ("non-GAAP" or "adjusted") that is defined by the Company as operating income excluding impairment, restructuring and other charges. Adjusted operating income is not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and is not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Non-GAAP information is provided as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, or as superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe that this non-GAAP information is useful as an additional means for investors to evaluate our operating performance, when reviewed in conjunction with our GAAP consolidated financial statements and provides a higher degree of transparency.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (this "MD A") is intended to help the reader understand the Company, our operations and our present business environment. This MD A is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our MD A for Fiscal 2023, which can be found in Part II, Item 7 of our Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K. 
 In addition, the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements and should be read in conjunction with these statements and notes thereto. 
 Introduction 
 This MD A is organized as follows: 

Executive Overview 

Key Performance Indicators 

Current Trends and Outlook 

Results of Operations 

Non-GAAP Information 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Recent accounting pronouncements that the Company has adopted or is currently evaluating prior to adoption, including the dates of adoption or expected dates of adoption, as applicable, and the anticipated effects on the Company s audited Consolidated Financial Statements, are included in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. 
 Executive Overview 
 We are a leading global specialty retailer offering high-quality, on-trend clothing, accessories and personal care products at affordable prices under our American Eagle and Aerie brands. 
 We have two reportable segments, American Eagle and Aerie. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker (defined as our CEO) analyzes segment results and allocates resources based on adjusted operating income (loss), which is a non-GAAP financial measure. See Note 12, Segment Reporting, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information. 
 Key Performance Indicators 
 Our management evaluates the following items, which are considered key performance indicators, in assessing our performance: 
 Comparable Sales Comparable sales and comparable sales changes provide a measure of sales growth for stores and channels open at least one year over the comparable prior year period. In fiscal years following those with 53 weeks, including Fiscal 2024, the prior year period is shifted by one week to compare similar calendar weeks. A store is included in comparable sales in the 13th month of operation. However, stores that have a gross square footage change of 25 or greater due to a remodel are removed from the comparable sales base but are included in total sales. These stores are returned to the comparable sales base in the 13th month following the remodel. Sales from American Eagle, Aerie, Todd Snyder, and Unsubscribed stores, as well as sales from AEO Direct and other digital channels, are included in total comparable sales. Sales from licensed stores are not included in comparable sales. Individual American Eagle and Aerie brand comparable sales disclosures include sales from stores and AEO Direct. 
 29 

Omni-Channel Sales Performance Our management utilizes the following quality of sales metrics in evaluating our omni-channel sales performance: comparable sales, average unit retail price, total transactions, units per transaction, and consolidated comparable traffic. We include these metrics in our discussion within this MD A when we believe that they enhance the understanding of the matter being discussed. Investors may find them useful as such. Each of these metrics is defined as follows (except comparable sales, which is defined separately above): 
 Average unit retail price represents the selling price of our goods. It is the cumulative net sales divided by the net units sold for a period of time. 

Total transactions represents the count of customer transactions over a period of time (inclusive of Company-owned stores and AEO Direct, unless specified otherwise). 

Units per transaction represents the number of units sold divided by total transactions over a period of time (inclusive of Company-owned stores and AEO Direct, unless specified otherwise). 

Consolidated comparable traffic represents visits to our Company-owned stores, limited to those stores that qualify to be included in comparable sales as defined above, including AEO Direct, over a period of time. 

Gross Profit Gross profit measures whether we are optimizing the profitability of our sales. Gross profit is the difference between total net revenue and cost of sales. Cost of sales consists of merchandise costs, including design, sourcing, importing, and inbound freight costs, as well as markdowns, shrinkage and certain promotional costs, Quiet Platforms' costs to service its customers and buying, occupancy and warehousing costs and services. Design costs consist of compensation, rent, depreciation, travel, supplies, and samples. 
 Buying, occupancy and warehousing costs and services consist of compensation, employee benefit expenses and travel for our buyers and certain senior merchandising executives; rent and utilities related to our stores, corporate headquarters, distribution centers and other office space; freight from our distribution centers to the stores; compensation and supplies for our distribution centers, including purchasing, receiving and inspection costs; and shipping and handling costs related to our e-commerce operations. 
 The inability to obtain acceptable levels of sales, initial markups or any significant increase in our use of markdowns could have an adverse effect on our gross consolidated profit and results of operations. 
 Operating Income Our management views operating income as a key indicator of our performance. The key drivers of operating income are net revenue, gross profit, our ability to control selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses, and our level of capital expenditures. Operating profit rate is operating profit as a percent of revenue. 
 Cash Flow and Liquidity Our management evaluates cash flow from operations and investing and financing activities in determining the sufficiency of our cash position and capital allocation strategies. Cash flow has historically been sufficient to cover our uses of cash. Our management believes that cash flow and liquidity will be sufficient to fund anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements for the next twelve months and beyond. 
 Current Trends and Outlook 
 Macroeconomic Conditions and Inflation 
 During Fiscal 2023 and the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024, our results were negatively impacted by macroeconomic challenges and global inflationary pressures impacting consumer spending behavior, which constrained revenue and increased margin pressure to clear through excess inventory. Given ongoing external uncertainties, we have taken additional actions to improve financial performance, including more operating efficiency initiatives, as described below under "Profit Improvement Program". For further information about the risks associated with global economic conditions and the effect of economic pressures on our business, see " Risk Factors " in Part I, Item 1A of our Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Omni-Channel and Digital Capabilities 
 
 We sell merchandise through our digital channels, www.ae.com, www.aerie.com, and our AEO apps, both domestically and internationally in approximately 80 countries. We also sell AE brand and Aerie brand merchandise on various international online marketplaces. We offer Todd Snyder and Unsubscribed brand products online at www.toddsnyder.com and www.unsubscribed.com, respectively. The digital channels reinforce each particular brand and are designed to complement the in-store experience. 
 
 Over the past several years, we have invested in building our technologies and digital capabilities. We focused our investments in three key areas: making significant advances in mobile technology, investing in digital marketing and improving the digital customer experience. 
 30 

Profit Improvement Program 
 We launched our profit improvement program, "Powering Profitable Growth," during Fiscal 2023, which focused on a comprehensive review of our cost structure. Early actions focused on the components of gross margin and contributed to margin expansion in Fiscal 2023. Other significant work streams have been identified, actioned and incorporated into our Fiscal 2024 plans. The results of these initiatives are expected to yield gross margin expansion, as well as SG A and depreciation leverage, resulting in an improved operating profit rate. Through the third quarter of Fiscal 2024, we saw expansion of our gross profit rate of 60 basis points and expansion of our operating rate of 170 basis points in comparison to the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023, primarily as a result of our initiatives. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 
 The third quarter of Fiscal 2024 showed continued progress on our "Powering Profitable Growth" plan, marked by the three strategic priorities. Compared to the third quarter of Fiscal 2023: 
 
 Total revenue decreased 1 to 1.289 billion from 1.301 billion, which included an approximately 45 million headwind from the shifted 2024 retail calendar. Comparable sales increased 3 . 

Operating income decreased 19 million, or 15 year over year including approximately 20 million negative impact from the retail calendar shift. Adjusted operating income, which excludes 18 million from the impairment, restructuring, and other charges decreased 2 million to prior year. 

Diluted earnings per share decreased of 0.41, or 0.48 on an adjusted basis, for the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024 compared to 0.49 for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023.

 Comparison of the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024 to the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023 
 
 Total Net Revenue 
 
 Total net revenue decreased 1 to 1.289 billion for the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024, compared to 1.301 billion last year. The shift in the retail calendar negatively impacted revenue by approximately 45 million for the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024. 
 
 Digital revenue increased 6 , and store revenue decreased 4 compared to the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023. The increase in digital revenue was driven by increased transactions. The decrease in store revenue was primarily attributable to the shift in the retail calendar. Total comparable sales increased by 3 , compared to a 5 increase last year.

The 3 decrease in gross profit resulted primarily from the impact of the shifted retail calendar on revenue, as well as an 18 million increase in markdowns due to timing of promotional activity in the third quarter of Fiscal 2024. Buying, occupancy and warehousing costs were flat compared to the third quarter of Fiscal 2023. 
 
 During the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, 2.5 million and 4.5 million, respectively, of share-based payment expense were included in gross profit, representing both time- and performance-based awards. 
 
 Our gross profit may not be comparable to that of other retailers, as some retailers include all costs related to their distribution network, as well as design costs in cost of sales and others may exclude a portion of these costs from cost of sales, including them in a line item such as SG A expenses.

The increase was primarily the result of the 4 increase in revenue discussed above, leading to a 27 million, or 3 , increase in gross profit driven by a 44 million increase in merchandise margin, offset by a 7 million increase in buying, occupancy, and warehousing costs from the increased sales volume. The gross profit improvement was partially offset by a 17 million increase in SG A costs, primarily from incremental advertising and store compensation to arrive at the 13 million increase in operating income. 
 
 Aerie. The increase was primarily the result of the 6 increase in revenue discussed above, leading to a 51 million increase in gross profit driven by a 51 million increase in merchandise margin. The gross profit improvement was partially offset by a 22 million increase in SG A expenses, primarily driven by store compensation and incremental advertising costs to arrive at the 30 million increase in operating income. 
 
 General Corporate Expenses. The reduction in expense is primarily due to a 13 million decrease in performance-based incentives and other compensation, an 8 million decrease in depreciation and amortization, and a 4 million decrease in professional services.

 International Operations 
 We have agreements with multiple third-party operators to expand our brands internationally. Our international licensing partners acquire the right to sell, promote, market, and/or distribute various categories of our products in a given geographic area and to source products from us. International licensees' rights include the right to own and operate retail stores and may include rights to sell in wholesale markets, shop-in-shop concessions and rights to operate online marketplace businesses. As of November 2, 2024, our international licensing partners operated in 310 licensed retail stores and concessions, as well as wholesale markets, online brand sites, and online marketplaces in approximately 30 countries. 
 As of November 2, 2024, we had 103 Company-owned stores in Canada, 85 in Mexico, 13 in Hong Kong, and seven in Puerto Rico. Refer to Note 14, Impairment, Restructuring and Other Charges, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information regarding Hong Kong retail operations. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our uses of cash have historically been for working capital, the construction of new stores and remodeling of existing stores, information technology and e-commerce upgrades and investments, distribution center improvements and expansion, and the return of value to stockholders through the repurchase of common stock and the payment of dividends. Additionally, our uses of cash have included the development of the Aerie brand, investments in technology and omni-channel capabilities, and our international expansion efforts. 
 Historically, our uses of cash have been funded with cash flows from operations and existing cash on hand. We also maintain an asset-based revolving Credit Facility that allows us to borrow up to 700 million, which will expire in June 2027. As of November 2, 2024, there were no borrowings under the Credit Facility. Refer to Note 8, Long-Term Debt, Net, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information. 
 As of November 2, 2024, we had approximately 160.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. We expect to be able to fund our future cash requirements through current cash holdings and available liquidity.

 Share Repurchases 
 On February 1, 2024, our Board authorized the public repurchase of 30.0 million shares under a new share repurchase program, which expires on February 3, 2029. During the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024, there were 6.0 million shares repurchased under this authorization. 
 During the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, we repurchased approximately 0.5 million and 0.8 million shares, respectively, from certain employees at market prices totaling 13.6 million and 10.7 million, respectively. These shares were repurchased for the payment of taxes, in connection with the vesting of share-based payments, as permitted under our equity incentive plans. 
 The aforementioned repurchased shares have been recorded as treasury stock. 
 Dividends 
 During the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.125 per share on September 24, 2024, which was paid on October 30, 2024. 
 The Company maintains the right to defer the record and payment dates of any declared dividends, depending upon, among other factors, business performance and the macroeconomic environment. The payment of future dividends is at the discretion of our Board and is based on future earnings, cash flow, financial condition, capital requirements, changes inU.S. taxation, and other relevant factors. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our critical accounting policies and estimates are described in Part I, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , and in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended February 3, 2024, each contained in our Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K. Any new accounting policies or updates to existing accounting policies as a result of new accounting pronouncements have been discussed in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report. The application of our critical accounting policies and estimates may require our management to make judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our management uses historical experience and all available information to make these estimates and judgments, and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates. 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 We are exposed to the impact of foreign exchange rate risk primarily through our Canadian and Mexican operations where the functional currency is the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso, respectively. The impact of all other foreign currencies is currently immaterial to our consolidated financial results. An unrealized loss of 10.6 million and 33.5 million is included in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income during the 13 and 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024, respectively. Our market risk profile as of February 3, 2024 is disclosed in Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk , of our Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K, which is unchanged as of November 2, 2024. 
 43 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES . 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the management of American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. ("Management"), including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 
 In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report, as of November 2, 2024, the Company performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our Management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in the timely and accurate recording, processing, summarizing, and reporting of material financial and non-financial information within the time periods specified within the SEC s rules and forms. Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer also concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our Management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 44 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 
 We are involved, from time to time, in actions associated with or incidental to our business, including, among other things, matters involving consumer privacy, trademark and other intellectual property, licensing, importation of products, taxation, and employee relations. We believe at present that the resolution of currently pending matters will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. However, our assessment of any litigation or other legal claims could potentially change in light of the discovery of facts not presently known or determinations by judges, juries, or other finders of fact that are not in accord with management's evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or claims. Consistent with SEC Regulation S-K Item 103, we have elected to disclose those environmental proceedings with a governmental entity as a party where the company reasonably believes such proceeding would result in monetary sanctions, exclusive of interest and costs, of 1.0 million or more. Applying this threshold, there are no environmental matters to disclose for this period. 
 Refer to Note 11, Legal Proceedings, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information. 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 
 Risk factors that affect our business and financial results are discussed within Part I, Item 1A of our Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to our risk factors as disclosed in the Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K.
