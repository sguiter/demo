ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

You
should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the condensed financial
statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our audited financial statements included
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition to historical condensed financial information, the
following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ
materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. 

Overview 

We
were incorporated as Avochips Inc., an Oregon corporation, on February 21, 2017, and on November 2, 2017, we converted into Avochips,
LLC, an Oregon limited liability company. On November 19, 2021, we converted from an Oregon limited liability company into BranchOut
Food Inc., a Nevada corporation. 

We
are engaged in the development, marketing, sale, and distribution of plant-based, dehydrated fruit and vegetable snacks and powders.
Our products have historically been manufactured for us by two contract manufacturers, one based in the Republic of Chile, and the other
in the Republic of Peru, which housed our large-scale continuous through-put dehydration machine that completed
its first production run in the first quarter of 2023. Our dehydrated fruit and vegetable products are produced using a new proprietary
dehydration technology licensed by us from a third party. Our customers are primarily located throughout the United States. In 2024,
we decided to initiate our own production facility in Peru to become vertically integrated. We recently completed the build out of the
new facility, which commenced operations in October 2024, and utilizes three large-scale REV machines (a REV 60, REV 100 and REV 120 that we recently purchased from
EnWave Corporation, as well as, a small REV 10 R D machine that is being used for product development
and customer sample purposes . 

Using
our licensed technology platform, we believe our lines of branded, private-label and industrial ingredient products positively address current consumer
trends. In our experience, conventional dehydration methods, such as freeze-drying and air drying, tend to degrade most fruit and vegetables
through oxidation, browning/color degradation, nutritional content reduction and/or flavor loss. As a result, certain highly sensitive
fruits, such as avocados and bananas, have not previously been successfully offered as a dehydrated base for consumer products. We believe
that our licensed technology platform and process is the only way to produce quality avocado and banana-based snack and powdered products.
Additionally, we believe our licensed technology platform produces superior products when using other fruits and vegetables when compared
to conventional drying and dehydration technologies. We license technology, consisting of a portfolio of patents, and purchased production
machines, from EnWave, and we have been granted the exclusive rights to use the licensed technology platform as applied to avocados.
In addition, BranchOut has the nonexclusive rights to use the licensed technology platform for other products. 

Our
Products 

We
plan to grow revenues strategically by penetrating the multi-billion dollar grocery market opportunity presented by our current product
lines, as well as expanding our platform to include additional products that meet our strict plant-based ingredient criteria. Our current
primary branded products are: 

BranchOut
 Snacks: dehydrated fruit and vegetable-based snacks, including Avocado Chips, Chewy Banana Bites, Pineapple Chips, Brussels Sprout
 Crisps and Bell Pepper Crisps. 

BranchOut
 Powders: Avocado Powder, Banana Powder and Blueberry Powder. 

BranchOut
 Industrial Ingredients: Bulk Avocado Powder, dried avocado pieces and other fruit powders/pieces. 

We
are currently developing additional products, including dragon fruit and private label products for large retailers.

Going
Concern Uncertainty 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company has incurred recurring losses from operations resulting in an accumulated deficit of 16,074,867,
with working capital of 702,541. We are too early in our development stage to project revenue with a necessary level of certainty; therefore,
we may not have sufficient funds to sustain our operations for the next twelve months and we may need to raise additional cash to fund
our operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The Company continues to develop
its operations. In the event sales do not materialize at the expected rates, management would seek additional financing or would attempt
to conserve cash by further reducing expenses. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving these objectives. 

The
condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of any uncertainty as to
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed consolidated financial statements also do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classifications of liabilities that might
be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Our ability to scale production and distribution capabilities
and further increase the value of our brands, is largely dependent on our success in raising additional capital. 

Access
to our Equipment in Peru; NXTDried Superfoods 

During
the fourth quarter of 2023, NXTDried Superfoods, our contract manufacturer located in Peru, became involved in a legal dispute with its
landlord and another third party, which resulted in that manufacturer suspending operations. As a result of such dispute, we currently
do not have access to the dehydration machine that was previously operated by this manufacturer. Although we have been able to continue
to fulfill orders by shifting fulfillment to other manufacturing sources, and have recently opened our new facility in Peru, our costs of goods for
the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2024, have increased as a result. In
addition, during 2023, we recognized 761,085 of impairment expense, consisting of 485,265, 243,305 and 32,515 on the collectability
of a note receivable, VAT taxes receivable and prepaid inventory, respectively , owed to us by NXTDried Superfoods. 

Peru
Facility Lease 

Given
the situation with NXTDried Superfoods, we were required to shift fulfillment of orders to alternative manufacturing sources. On May
10, 2024 we entered into a ten-year lease for a 50,000 square-foot food processing plant located in Peru. The lease of the Peru Facility requires us to make monthly lease payments of 8,000 in
the first two years of the lease, 20,000 in the third year of the lease, 22,000 in the fourth year of the lease, 24,000 in the fourth
year of the lease, and 25,000 thereafter. The lease also has a 10-year renewal option, and a buy-out option under which we may purchase
the Peru Facility for 1,865,456. 

In
connection with our lease of the Peru Facility, we paid 275,000 on May 10, 2024, toward the purchase of a first position mortgage receivable
in the amount of 1,267,000, which is secured by the Peru Facility and was owed by the landlord of the Peru Facility to its former tenant,
for a purchase price of 1,267,000. The remaining 992,000 was due and payable by us on August 10, 2024, subject to certain requirements
which haven t yet been met, therefore the Company has deferred payment until a later date, to be determined.

Net
Revenue 

Our
net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2,181,495, compared to 906,996 for the three months ended September 30,
2023, an increase of 1,274,499, or 141 . The increase in revenue was primarily due to increased sales to our largest customer during
the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Cost
of Goods Sold and Gross Profit 

Our
cost of goods sold for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1,845,155, compared to 934,603 for the three months ended September
30, 2023, an increase of 910,552, or 97 . Cost of goods sold increased primarily due to increased sales during the three months ended
September 30, 2024. As a result of the foregoing, we had gross profit of 336,340, representing gross margins of 15 , for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a gross loss of 27,607, or negative gross margins of 3 , for the three months ended September
30, 2023. Our gross profit margin increased primarily due to cost savings realized as a result of our transition to bulk shipping arrangements
during the current period. Cost of goods sold included depreciation expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 60,614,
compared to 55,939 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 4,675, or 8 . 

General

Advertising
and marketing expenses increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding period in 2023, as we focused
our resources on our IPO in the prior period. Our rent increased primarily due to leases entered into in the current year, as we began
to develop our operating facility in Peru, which resulted in increased travel expenses for the same reason. Sales commissions decreased
as we focused most of our resources on servicing our largest customer. We expect commissions to increase as we grow. Storage, shipping
and handling expenses increased primarily due to increased international shipping rates and increased production that was driven by our
increased sales.

Other
Income (Expense) 

In
the three months ended September 30, 2024, other expense was 367,650 on a net basis, consisting of 370,532 of interest expense, as
partially offset by 2,882 of interest income. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, other expense was 7,003 on a net basis,
consisting of 10,004 of interest expense, as partially offset by 3,001 of interest income. Other expense increased by 360,647, or

Net
Cash Used in Operating Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 3,259,049 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3,258,248 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 801. The increase was primarily due to our increased net loss and increased inventory purchases, as adjusted for increased
stock-based compensation, increased accounts payable, and a 275,000 payment for
other assets. 

Net
Cash Used in Investing Activities 

Net
cash used in investing activities was 2,095,691 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 66,565 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 2,029,126, or 3,048 . This increase was primarily attributable to 2,120,337 of property and
equipment purchases, as partially offset by 24,646 of advances received on notes receivable in the current period, compared to 66,565
of property and equipment purchases in the comparative period. 

Net
Cash Provided by Financing Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 5,767,938 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3,784,850 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 1,983,088, or 52 . Our increased cash provided by financing activities was
primarily from 3,703,710 of increased net proceeds received on debt financing, 2,071,439 of decreased debt repayments, 326,975 of
decreased deferred offering cost payments, and 3,964 of decreased principal payments on finance leases, as partially offset by
 4,123,000 of decreased proceeds received on the sale of common stock. 

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

Our
financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods. In the nine-month period ended September
30, 2024 there were no changes to the application of critical accounting policies disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2023. 

CAUTIONARY
NOTICE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). All statements in this report, other
than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements for purposes of these provisions, including any projections
of earnings, revenues or other financial items, any statements of the plans and objectives of our management for future operations, any
statements concerning proposed new products or services, any statements regarding the integration, development or commercialization of
the business or any assets acquired from other parties, any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance, and any statements
of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of terminology
such as may, will, expects, plans, anticipates, intends, 
 seeks, believes, estimates, potential, forecasts, continue, 
or other forms of these words or similar words or expressions, or the negative thereof or other comparable terminology. Although we believe
that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such
expectations or any of the forward-looking statements will prove to be correct, and actual results will likely differ, and could differ
materially, from those projected or assumed in the forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned not to unduly rely on any such
forward-looking statements. 

All
subsequent forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by
these cautionary statements. Our actual results will likely differ, and may differ materially, from anticipated results. Financial estimates
are subject to change and are not intended to be relied upon as predictions of future operating results. All forward-looking statements
included in this report are made as of the date hereof and are based on information available to us as of such date. We assume no obligation
to update any forward-looking statement. If we do update or correct one or more forward-looking statements, investors and others should

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

The
Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a smaller reporting company, as defined
in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate disclosure controls and procedures for our company. Consequently,
our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act as of September 30, 2024. In designing and evaluating
the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated,
can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and
procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating
the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief
financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

During
the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).
