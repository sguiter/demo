million as of September 30, 2024 . The Company anticipates incurring additional losses until such time, if ever, that it can generate significant sales of kidneyintelX.dkd or KidneyIntelX technology services income. Post-period, the Company has closed an equity financing round of approximately million, net of expenses, that concurrent with the completion of cost reductions achieved through its reorganization and increasing testing services sales, management believes will be likely to bring the company through profitable operations in the next 2 years. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon successful execution of management s intended plan over the next 24 months to improve the Company s liquidity and profitability, which includes, without limitation: The achievement of certain testing volumes in the lab; 

 Continued expansion of reimbursement policies and contracts with commercial payers; and 

 Continued management of operating and commercial expenses. 

 As a result of the Company's losses and its projected cash needs, as defined in the accounting literature, substantial doubt exists about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. While subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company has successfully raised approximately million, net of expenses, in new equity capital and restructured the existing long term debt recorded on the Balance Sheet, the company does have a history of operating losses and it has been expensive to deliver all of the milestones to commercialize the kidneyintelX.dkd test. Should the company require additional capital it may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and the Company may not be able to enter into strategic alliances or other arrangements on favorable terms, or at all. The terms of any future financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of the Company s shareholders. Should it be necessary, if the Company is unable to obtain funding it could be required to delay, curtail or discontinue research and development programs, product portfolio expansion or future commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect its business prospects. As such,

million in amortizing senior convertible bonds due in April 2027 (the "Bonds") to CVI Investments, Inc. (the "Convertible Bond Investor"). The Bonds were issued at par value with total net proceeds of million and accrue interest at an annual rate of , payable quarterly in arrears, in cash or American Depositary Shares ("ADSs") valued at the ADS Settlement Price at the option of the Compan y. The principal and interest payments are due in equal quarterly installments starting in July 2022. The Bonds contain various conversion and redemption features. The initial conversion price for the Bonds of has been set at a percent premium to the Reference ADS Price. The Conversion Price may reset down at , and , depending on share price performance, and the Bonds have a hard floor in the conversion price of . As a result of the February 2023 private placement and pursuant to conditions of the bond agreement, the conversion price was adjusted to (previously and the floor price was adjusted to (previously ). Further, pursuant to such agreement, effective April 7, 2023, the conversion price was adjusted from to . Between amortization dates, the Convertible Bond Investor retains the right to advance future amortization payments, provided that (a) there shall be no amortization advancements during the first 12 months, (b) no more than two amortization advancements may occur in any 12-month period, and (c) no more than one amortization advancement may occur in any 3-month period. On March 28, 2024, the Company entered into a second amendment and restatement agreement with the Convertible Bond Investor, which further amended the terms of the Company s existing bond agreement. This Amendment to the bond agreement, among other things: implemented a beneficial ownership limitation whereby each bondholder, together with its affiliates, must not at any time own or acquire the beneficial ownership of more than of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of the Company; 

 adjusted the bondholder s maximum trading volume by removing a cap on the number of ADS that can be sold each day and reduced the length of certain non-trading periods applicable to the bondholders; 

 reduced certain market price observation periods to 5 days and 3 days (rather than 10 days and 5 days); 

 granted the holders of more than of the principal amount of the bonds issued thereunder and then-outstanding (the Majority Bondholders the right to defer the amortization payment scheduled for April 7, 2024 (the April 2024 Amortized Payment Amount in addition to the deferrals already permitted as well as the right to accelerate the April 2024 Amortized Payment Amount if previously deferred in addition to the accelerations already permitted; and 

 in addition to the existing right to accelerate the next scheduled amortization payment, provide the Majority Bondholders the ability to accelerate any other future scheduled amortization payment, subject to certain limitations. 

 The Company performed an analysis and determined that the financial impact was immaterial as the amended and restated agreement was not substantially different than the previous agreement. The Convertible Bond Investor is also permitted to defer up to two amortization payments to a subsequent amortization date. The Company retains the option to repay any deferred amortization in cash at percent of the nominal amount. In July 2023, the Company made a cash amortization payment of million, which consisted of million of principal and million of interest. Also, in July 2023, the Convertible Bond Investor exercised its right to advance an amortization payment and the Company made an accelerated repayment of million through the issuance of ADSs.

On issuance, the Company elected to account for the Bonds at fair value in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, with qualifying changes in fair value being recognized through the statements of operations and comprehensive loss until the Bonds are settled. Changes in fair value related to instrument-specific credit risk are recognized through comprehensive loss until the Bonds are settled. The fair value of the bonds is determined using a scenario-based analysis that estimates the fair value based on the probability-weighted present value of expected future investment returns, considering each of the possible outcomes available to the noteholders. Significant assumptions used in the fair value analysis include the volatility rate, risk-free rate, dividend yield and risky yield. The fair value of the Bonds was determined to be million on issuance, which is the principal amount of the Bonds. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the Bonds was determined to be million. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a decrease in fair value of the Notes related to the instrument-specific credit risk of million in comprehensive loss and a decrease in fair value related to non-instrument specific credit risk of million as a loss in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss, respectively. The Company recognized an increase in fair value of the Notes related to the instrument-specific credit risk of million in comprehensive loss and a decrease in fair value related to non-instrument specific credit risk of million as a loss in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss during the three months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively. 

 months or less. Many of the Company's leases contain variable non-lease components such as maintenance, taxes, insurance, and similar costs for the spaces it occupies.

Upon adoption of ASC 842, the Company elected the package of practical expedients and the hindsight practical expedient but did not elect the easement practical expedient which is not applicable to the Company as the Company does not have any ground leases. In accordance with the package of practical expedients, the Company has not reassessed any of their existing or expired contracts or any other agreements that were previously concluded to not contain a lease for the following practical expedient guidance: (1) whether the arrangement is or contains a lease, (2) lease classification and (3) whether previously capitalized costs continue to qualify as initial direct costs. The Company leased lab space in Salt Lake City, UT, under a lease, the term of which commenced in November 2019. The Company has measured its right-of-use assets and lease liabilities based on lease terms ending in . The Company consolidated Utah lab operations in November 2023, using it as an office space instead of lab space. After the end of the lease in October 2024, the Company will maintain the space on a month-to-month term. The Company leased lab space in New York City, NY, under an initial lease, the term of which commenced in February 2019. The Company has classified this lease as a short-term lease as the Company concluded that the noncancelable terms of this lease was less than one year at the commencement and none of the Company's renewals or amendments were for additional noncancelable terms greater than one year. The Company leased office space in New York City, NY, under an initial month-to-month term, the term of which commenced in June 2018. The lease did not have termination or formal renewal options however the Company can renew their office space if they are still needed and are still available at the end of the term. The Company has classified this lease as a short-term lease as the Company concluded that the noncancelable terms of this lease was less than one year at the commencement and none of the Company's renewals or amendments were for additional noncancelable terms greater than one year. The Company identified and assessed the following significant assumptions in recognizing its right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities during the adoption of ASC 842: As the Company's leases do not provide an implicit rate, it concluded that a IBR, the approximate midpoint between the average commercial real estate loans during 2022, is an appropriate discount rate to use for the Utah lease, which was the only lease existing as of the adoption date.

Cost of revenue 

The fair value of options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which takes into account inputs such as the exercise price, the value of the underlying ordinary shares at the grant date, expected term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The fair value of each grant of options during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were determined using the methods and assumptions discussed below. The expected term of employee options is determined using the simplified method, as prescribed in SEC s Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, whereby the expected life equals the arithmetic average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option due to the Company s lack of sufficient historical data. 

 The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the publicly-traded common stock of a peer group of companies. 

 The risk-free interest rate is based on the interest rate payable on U.S. Treasury securities in effect at the time of grant for a period that is commensurate with the assumed expected term. 

 The expected dividend yield is none because the Company has not historically paid and does not expect for the foreseeable future to pay a dividend on its ordinary shares.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes for the year ended June 30, 2024, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on September 30, 2024 (the Annual Report on Form 10-K ), as well as the information contained under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and "Risk Factors" contained in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, and Part II, Item 1A "Risk Factors" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and other information provided from time to time in our other filings with the SEC. 
 Overview 
 Renalytix is focused on providing doctors around the world with a safe, reliable and effective tool to identify which patients are or are not in danger of losing significant kidney function and falling into kidney failure and may require long-term dialysis or a kidney transplant. Chronic kidney disease is one of the largest urgent medical needs, globally affecting an estimated 850 million people, and is responsible for an unsustainable and growing societal cost burden. 
 We believe an important part of the answer is preventative medicine and the ability to identify individuals with advancing chronic kidney disease early, where new drug therapies and clinical strategies have the optimal chance to stop uncontrolled disease progression. 
 At Renalytix, we have developed kidneyintelX.dkd, the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") authorized in vitro prognostic test that uses an artificial intelligence-enabled algorithm to aid in assessment of the risk of progressive decline in kidney function. The test is designed to predict early in the progression of kidney disease who is at risk for significant sustained decline in kidney function. Prognostic tests, such as kidneyintelX.dkd, are not intended for diagnosing any disease or for monitoring disease progression or the effect of any therapeutic product. Rather, prognostic tests are intended to be used in conjunction with other clinical and diagnostic findings and consistent with professional standards of practice, including information obtained by alternative methods, and clinical evaluation, as appropriate. When used as intended, potential interventions can be considered early, ideally before major damage is done and when treatments can be most effective. KidneyintelX.dkd is part of a family of clinical tests being developed from the KidneyIntelX technology platform developed using technology licensed from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston and under development through U.S. and international collaborations. 
 We are deploying kidneyintelX.dkd to patient populations with DKD on a regional basis through partnerships with healthcare systems and insurance payors that provide coverage to those healthcare systems patients. In June 2024 , Medicare issued a final Local Coverage Determination LCD for the Company s kidneyintelX.dkd testing and is effective for dates of service on or after August 1, 2024. The established Medicare price for kidneyintelX.dkd is 950 per test. Distinct CPT Codes (Common Procedural Terminology Codes) have been established for kidneyintelX.dkd and is published in CMS 2024 Clinical Lab Fee Schedule. The LCD specifies coverage for use of kidneyintelX.dkd for patients with diagnosed Type 2 diabetes and Stage 1-3b Chronic Kidney Disease is reasonable and necessary. The LCD was issued by National Government Services NGS ). NGS is a subsidiary of Elevance Health, Inc. (previously Anthem, Inc.), a Medicare Administrative Contractor responsible for claims processing for testing performed in the Company s New York City laboratory. 
 Since our inception in March 2018, we have focused primarily on organizing and staffing our company, raising capital, developing KidneyIntelX technology, conducting clinical validation studies for kidneyintelX.dkd, establishing and protecting our intellectual property portfolio and commercial laboratory operations, pursuing regulatory approval, developing our reimbursement strategy and commercializing our testing services. We have funded our operations primarily through equity and debt financings. 
 There is always the possibility that a change in the regulatory or reimbursement landscape can have an impact on our ability to deliver commercial kidneyintelX.dkd testing services in the United States, maintain the current and anticipated costs and services reportable result turnaround times. Any of the aforementioned changes could materially alter our revenue projections. 
 Macroeconomic Considerations 
 Unfavorable conditions in the economy in the United States and abroad may negatively affect the growth of our business and our results of operations. For example, macroeconomic events, including conflicts in Ukraine-Russia and Middle East, increased inflation rates and U.S. and U.K. interest rates, have led to economic uncertainty globally. The effect of macroeconomic conditions may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. If, however, economic uncertainty increases or the global economy worsens, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed. For further discussion of the potential impacts of macroeconomic events on our business, financial condition, and operating results, see the section titled Risk Factors in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our Key Agreements 
 Mount Sinai Health System 
 In May 2018, we entered into the Mount Sinai Agreement, with Mount Sinai, pursuant to which we obtained a worldwide, royalty-bearing, exclusive license under certain patents and a worldwide, royalty-bearing, non-exclusive license under certain know-how of Mount Sinai to develop and commercialize licensed products in connection with the application of artificial intelligence for the diagnosis of kidney disease. Pursuant to the terms of the Mount Sinai Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts in connection with the development and commercialization of the licensed technologies, including in accordance with specified diligence milestones.

We are also obligated to pay Mount Sinai a 4 to 5 royalty on net sales of kidneyintelX.dkd, subject to customary reductions. Royalties are payable on a product-by-product basis from first commercial sale of such product until the later of (1) expiration of the last valid claim of a licensed patent covering such product or (2) on a country-by-country basis, 12 years from first commercial sale of such product in such country. Moreover, we are obligated to pay Mount Sinai between 15 and 25 of any consideration received by us from a sublicensee. The two provisional patent applications covering the KidneyIntelX diagnostic in-licensed under the Mount Sinai Agreement were filed in February 2020 and April 2020, respectively. 
 The Mount Sinai Agreement expires on the later of the tenth anniversary of the execution of the agreement and expiration of the last remaining royalty term. We may terminate the Mount Sinai Agreement at any time upon 90 days prior written notice. Mount Sinai may terminate the agreement for our uncured material breach, our failure to meet certain diligence milestones, our insolvency, or in the event that we challenge the validity or enforceability of any licensed patent. 
 Joslin Diabetes Center 
 In July 2017, EKF entered into the Joslin Agreement with Joslin. In October 2018, we purchased all of EKF s rights, title, interest and benefit in the Joslin Agreement in exchange for the issuance of 15.4 million of our ordinary shares. 
 Pursuant to the Joslin Agreement and the related assignment from EKF, we obtained a worldwide, royalty-bearing, exclusive license under any patents and any related know-how of Joslin related to the patent application filed with respect to the Joslin IP to make, have made, use, offer for sale and sell licensed products covered by claims in the Joslin IP, and to perform, practice offer for sale and sell certain licensed processes related to the Joslin IP. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts in connection with the development and commercialization of the licensed products and licensed processes, including in accordance with a development plan. 
 Under the terms of the Joslin Agreement, we are obligated to pay Joslin aggregate commercial milestone payments of 0.3 million and 1.0 million in commercial milestone payments upon achieving worldwide net sales of licensed products and processes of 2.0 million and 10.0 million, respectively. We are also obligated to pay Joslin a 5 royalty on net sales of any licensed products or licensed processes, subject to customary reductions. Moreover, we are obligated to pay Joslin 25 of any consideration received by us from a sublicensee. 
 The Joslin Agreement initially expires on July 31, 2025, and is subject to an automatic five-year extension unless either party notifies the other party of its intent not to extend the agreement at least 180 days prior to initial expiration. Either party may terminate the Joslin Agreement earlier upon an uncured material breach of the agreement by the other party, the insolvency of the other party, or in the event the other party is unable to perform its obligations under the agreement for a specified period. Additionally, Joslin may terminate the agreement in the event that we cease developing or commercializing licensed products or processes, if we fail to maintain certain required insurance policies, and if we fail to pay patent expenses related to the licensed patents.

Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenues 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we continued to deploy kidneyintelX.dkd to patient populations with DKD, on a regional basis through partnerships with healthcare systems and insurance payors that provide coverage to those healthcare systems patients. If these strategic partners fail to meet their key contractual obligations or to purchase kidneyintelX.dkd tests, it will likely have an adverse effect on us and our ability to achieve our commercial objectives, potentially including the attainment of sales volumes leading to profitability. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cost of revenue consists of costs directly attributable to the kidneyintelX.dkd testing and services rendered, including labor, lab consumables and sample collection costs directly related to revenue generating activities. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development costs consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with the development of KidneyIntelX technology. We are continuing to conduct limited clinical utility and other studies for kidneyintelX.dkd to expand long-term, prospective clinical value and performance in chronic kidney disease. We expense research and development costs as incurred. 
 We incur both direct and indirect expenses related to our research and development programs. Direct expenses include third-party expenses related to our programs such as expenses for data science and artificial intelligence capabilities, consulting fees, lab supplies, assay development services and clinical validation costs. Indirect expenses include salaries and other personnel-related costs, including share-based compensation for personnel in research and development functions and rent. 
 At the end of the reporting period, we compare payments made to third-party service providers to the estimated progress toward completion of the research or development objectives. Such estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available. Depending on the timing of payments to the service providers and the progress that we estimate to have been made as a result of the service provided, we may record net prepaid or accrued expense relating to these costs. Upfront milestone payments made to third parties who perform research and development services on our behalf are expensed as services are rendered. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and other personnel-related costs including share-based compensation; professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and administrative consulting services; legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters; administrative travel expenses; insurance costs; marketing expenses and other operating costs. Additionally, general and administrative expenses include the cost of maintaining our admission to AIM, Nasdaq and OTC trading.

General and administrative expenses decreased 2.8 million from 6.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was driven by even further cost cutting measures, which resulted in a 1.5 million decrease in compensation and related benefits, including share-based payments and bonuses, due to decreased headcount, 0.6 million decrease in consulting and professional fees, 0.2 million decrease in insurance costs, 0.2 million decrease in marketing, and 0.3 million decrease in other operating expenses. We have implemented a plan to further reduce payroll expense and total general and administrative expenses while preserving our sales capacity. 
 In connection with the delisting of our ADSs from Nasdaq effective on October 7, 2024, and our ADSs becoming quoted on the OTC Markets OTCQB tier effective on October 8, 2024, we anticipate that we will requalify as a foreign private issuer FPI at our next testing date for FPI status. As a foreign private issuer, we expect annual cost savings of up to 1.5 million from a reduction in regulatory filing costs, professional fees (audit, legal, and consulting), listing fees, insurance and other administrative costs when fully implemented.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Since our inception, we have incurred net losses. We incurred net losses of 4.7 million and 10.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 216.5 million. 
 November 2024 Debt Restructurings 
 In connection with the Company's previously equity fundraising (the Fundraise ), the Company also announced a revision to the terms of its 8.7 million amortizing senior convertible bond (the Convertible Bond held by a fund advised by Heights Capital Ireland LLC (the "Convertible Bond Investor"), subject to the closing of the Fundraise which closed in two tranches on October 7, 
 27 

2024 and November 4, 2024. Under the completed terms, the Convertible Bond was partially repaid and restructured as follows: (i) 2.97 million of the Convertible Bond was converted to equity via issue to the Convertible Bond Investor of 33 million ordinary shares (the Heights Conversion Shares ), at 9 pence per share price (the Issue Price being offered in the Fundraise; and (ii) the balance of the Convertible Bond was restructured as a new unsecured convertible bond (the New Convertible Bond ). The Heights Conversion Shares issued to the Convertible Bond Investor represented 9.9 of the Company s enlarged issued share capital at such time. The Convertible Bond Investor is subject to a 6-month lock-up. 
 The New Convertible Bond will accrue interest quarterly at a rate of 5.5 per annum if paid in cash, or 7.5 per annum if rolled into the principal amount of the outstanding, at the discretion of the Company. The New Convertible Bond has maturity date of July 31, 2029 and may not be converted before April 1, 2026, except in the event that the Company undertakes a further qualifying equity issuance in the future (which would exclude securities properly issued to employees and other staff of the Company for bona fide remuneration and incentivisation purposes). The New Convertible Bond can be redeemed as follows: 
 at any time from April 1, 2026, a holder of the New Convertible Bond can redeem any or all of the New Convertible Bond at a conversion price (subject to customary adjustment provisions) equal to 250 of the Issue Price; 

in the event of a change of control of the Company or if the ordinary shares cease to be admitted to trading on AIM or the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange (or if dealing in the ordinary shares is suspended, other than in connection with a corporate reorganization, for a period of 60 dealing days or more) or in the event that less than 20 of the Company s issued share capital (including ADSs) comprises free float, a holder of the New Convertible Bond can require the Company to redeem all but not some of their New Convertible Bond at a conversion price equal to 120 of the principal amount of the New Convertible Bond (together with accrued but unpaid interest); and 

at any time, the Company can elect to redeem all, but not some, of the principal amount of the New Convertible Bond at a price equal to the greater of (i) the principal amount and all accrued but unpaid interest and (ii) the parity value of the New Convertible Bond. For this purpose, the parity value is the product of: (a) such number of ordinary shares as would have been issued on conversion and the mean volume weighted average price of an ordinary share on the ten consecutive dealing days preceding the date on which such redemption is to occur. 

Additionally, an accounts payable balance with a professional adviser of 750,000 (the Advisor Accounts Payable Balance has been restructured such that 425,000 of the outstanding balance has been converted to equity at the Issue Price. The remaining 325,000 has been converted to a long term unsecured note (the Advisor Loan Note ), bearing interest at 5 per annum, which will be rolled into the principal amount of the Advisor Loan Note. The principal and interest of the Advisor Loan Note will be repaid on the earlier of: (i) 5 years from the issuance of the Advisor Loan Note; or (ii) such earlier time as the Company is acquired by another company. Additionally, the Company has the right to redeem the Advisor Loan Note at any time without prepayment penalties. 
 The Company believes that the restructuring of the Convertible Bond and the Advisor Accounts Payable Balance, the creation of the New Convertible Bond and the Advisor Loan Note and the Creditor Write-offs, along with some ancillary debt restructuring, will substantially reduce the Company s monthly cash burn. 
 The ordinary shares issued pursuant to the debt restructuring described in this section are approximately 36.5 million ordinary shares which were issued on November 4, 2024. 
 Equity Financings 
 The Company received commitments from existing and new investors to raise 11.8 million through a subscription of 131,161,556 new ordinary shares at 9 pence per share. The equity financing commitments closed in two tranches, the first on October 8, 2024 and the second on November 4, 2024 with all net proceeds received by the Company on the closing dates. 
 We expect to incur additional losses in the near future, and we expect our expenses may increase in connection with our ongoing activities to further commercial scale of kidneyintelX.dkd testing services. While we expect our costs associated with operating as a public company in the United States to be reduced following our transition to OTC trading markets, there may be additional capital and professional resources required to satisfy ongoing US regulatory requirements. The timing and amount of our operating expenditures will depend largely on: 
 the growth and uptake of kidneyintelX.dkd by doctors; 

the cost and supply of reagents for kidneyintelX.dkd; 

the cost, timing and outcome of identified and potential future commercialization activities, including manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for KidneyIntelX technology; 

28 

the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims, including any claims by third parties that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights; 

the timing and amount of future revenue received from commercial sales of kidneyintelX.dkd; 

the sales price and expansion of third-party coverage and reimbursement for kidneyintelX.dkd; 

the effect of competing technological and market developments; and 

the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies, although we currently have no other commitments or agreements to complete any such transactions. 

To date, we have primarily financed our operations through equity and debt financings. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 0.9 million. We have incurred recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and had an accumulated deficit of 216.5 million as of September 30, 2024. We anticipate incurring additional losses until such time, if ever, that we can generate significant incremental sales of kidneyintelX.dkd or any future products currently in development. 
 If we decide and to the extent that we could potentially raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our shareholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our shareholders. 
 Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or diagnostic products or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. Additional capital may not be available when needed, on reasonable terms, or at all, and our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, curtail or discontinue our product development or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market products that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. 
 Going Concern 
 We have limited sources of revenue to provide incoming cash flows to sustain our future operations. As outlined above, our ability to pursue our planned business activities is dependent upon our successful efforts to increase our testing revenue and the effectiveness of our expense management and other capital preservation measures. As discussed Note 16, Subsequent Events to the financial statements, subsequent to the end of the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company raised approximately 14.9 million, net of expenses, from additional rounds of equity in October and November 2024 and concurrently restructured a number of liabilities on the balance sheet. This additional equity funding, the reduction of cash expenses related to the Company s liabilities, and an overall reduction in General and Administrative Expenses, have significantly changed the Company s financial position. While the Company intends that this capital will be sufficient to fund the company through to cash flow positive operations, there can be no guarantee to that outcome. 
 The Company has incurred recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and had an accumulated deficit of 216.5 million as of September 30, 2024. The Company anticipates incurring additional losses until such time, if ever, that it can generate significant sales of kidneyintelX.dkd or any future products currently in development. 
 The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon successful execution of management s intended plan over the next 24 months to improve the Company s liquidity and profitability, which includes, without limitation: 
 The achievement of certain testing volumes in the lab; 

Continued expansion of reimbursement policies and contracts with commercial payers; and 

Continued management of operating and commercial expenses. 

As a result of the Company's losses and its projected cash needs, as defined in the accounting literature, substantial doubt exists about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. While subsequent to September 30, 2024, the company has successfully raised approximately 14.9 million, net of expenses, in new equity capital and restructured the existing long-term debt recorded on the balance sheet, the Company does have a history of operating losses and it has been expensive to deliver all of the milestones to 
 29 

commercialize the kidneyintelX.dkd test. Should the Company require additional capital it may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and the Company may not be able to enter into strategic alliances or other arrangements on favorable terms, or at all. The terms of any future financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of the Company s shareholders. Should it be necessary, if the Company is unable to obtain funding it could be required to delay, curtail or discontinue research and development programs, product portfolio expansion or future commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect its business prospects. As such, management has concluded that there is a going concern uncertainty. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this going concern uncertainty. 
 We have based our future cash needs on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect or may fail in our efforts to enact additional cost reduction programs. Furthermore, our operating plan may change, and we may need additional funds sooner than planned in order to meet operational needs and capital requirements for product development and commercialization. 
 As discussed in Note 16, Subsequent Events to the financial statements, subsequent to the end of the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company closed additional rounds of equity financing in October and November 2024 and concurrently restructured a number of liabilities on the balance sheet. As a result, the Company believes that it has sufficient cash on the balance sheet to sustain current operations.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this report for a description of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our financial statements. 
 JOBS Act Transition Period 
 In April 2012, the JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and, as a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. 
 We have evaluated the benefits of relying on other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements under the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions, as an emerging growth company, we have chosen to rely on certain of these exemptions, including without limitation exemptions to the requirements for (1) providing an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (2) complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier to occur of (a) the last day of the fiscal year (1) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our U.S. IPO, (2) in which we have total annual gross revenues of at least 1.235 billion or (3) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC, which means the market value of our ordinary shares and ADSs that are held by non-affiliates exceeds 700.0 million as of the prior December 31, or (b) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued expenses and share-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report, we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with the development of the KidneyIntelX technology platform. We expense research and development costs as incurred. 
 At the end of the reporting period, we compare payments made to third-party service providers to the estimated progress toward completion of the research or development objectives. Such estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available. Depending on the timing of payments to the service providers and the progress that we estimate has been made as a result of the service provided, we may record a prepaid expense or accrued liability relating to these costs. Upfront milestone payments made to third parties who perform research and development services on our behalf are expensed as services are rendered. Contingent development or regulatory milestone payments are recognized upon the related resolution of such contingencies. 
 We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each consolidated balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known at that time. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we will adjust the accrual accordingly. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services, including fees for process development or manufacturing and distribution of clinical supplies that will be used in future research and development activities, are deferred and recognized as expense in the period that the related goods are consumed or services are performed. 
 31 

Share-based Compensation 
 We measure equity classified share-based awards granted to employees and nonemployees based on the estimated fair value on the date of grant and recognize compensation expense of those awards over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period of the respective award. We account for forfeitures as they occur. For share-based awards with service-based vesting conditions, we recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period. The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires inputs based on certain subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the expected term of the option, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of the option, and our expected dividend yield. We were a privately-held organization prior to November 2018 and have been a publicly-traded company for a limited period of time and therefore lack company-specific historical and implied volatility information for our shares. Accordingly, we estimate our expected share price volatility based on the historical volatility of publicly-traded peer companies and expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our own traded share price. The expected term of our stock options has been determined utilizing the simplified method for awards that qualify as plain-vanilla options. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is none based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends on ordinary shares and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. 
 We classify share-based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss in the same manner in which the award recipient s payroll costs are classified or in which the award recipient s service payments are classified. 
 Convertible Notes 
 In April 2022, we issued amortizing senior convertible bonds with a principal amount of 21.2 million in amortizing senior convertible bonds due in April 2027 (the Bonds to CVI Investments, Inc. (the Convertible Bond Investor ). The Bonds were issued at 85 par value with total net proceeds of 18.0 million and accrue interest at an annual rate of 5.5 , payable quarterly in arrears, in cash or ADSs valued at the ADS Settlement Price at our option. The principal and interest payments are due in equal quarterly installments starting in July 2022. The Bonds contain various conversion and redemption features. The initial conversion price for the Convertible Bonds of 8.70 has been set at a 20 percent premium to the Reference ADS Price. The Conversion Price may reset down at 12, 24 and 36 months, depending on share price performance, the Bonds have a hard floor in the conversion price of 7.25. As a result of the February 2023 private placement and pursuant to conditions of the bond agreement, the conversion price was adjusted to 8.2508 (previously 8.70) and the floor price was adjusted to 6.8757 (previously 7.25). Further, pursuant to conditions of the agreement, effective April 7, 2023, the conversion price was adjusted from 8.2508 to 7.7924. Between amortization dates, Convertible Bond Investor retains the right to advance future amortization payments, provided that (a) there shall be no amortization advancements during the first 12 months, (b) no more than two amortization advancements may occur in any 12-month period, and (c) no more than one amortization advancement may occur in any 3-month period. On March 28, 2024, the Company entered into a second amendment and restatement agreement with the Convertible Bond Investor, which amended the terms of the Company s existing bond agreement, dated March 31, 2022. The Company performed an analysis and determined that the financial impact was immaterial as the amended and restated agreement was not substantially different than the previous agreement. 
 The Convertible Bond Investor is also permitted to defer up to two amortization payments to a subsequent amortization date. We retain the option to repay any deferred amortization in cash at 100 percent of the nominal amount. In July 2022, we made a cash amortization payment of 1.4 million, which consisted of 1.1 million of principal and 0.3 million of interest. In October 2022, the Convertible Bond Investor deferred the October amortization payment to maturity of the bond and we made an interest payment of 0.3 million. In January 2023, we made a cash amortization payment of 1.4 million, which consisted of 1.1 million of principal and 0.3 million of interest. In April 2023, we made a cash amortization payment of 1.4 million, which consisted of 1.1 million of principal and 0.3 million of interest. In July 2023, we made a cash amortization payment of 1.4 million, which consisted of 1.1 million of principal and 0.3 million of interest. Also in July 2023, the Convertible Bond Investor exercised its right to advance an amortization payment and we made an accelerated repayment of 1.1 million through the issuance of 526,211 ADSs representing 1,052,422 ordinary shares. In October 2023, we made an amortization payment of 1.3 million, which consisted of 1.1 million of principal and 0.2 million of interest, through the issuance of 2,335,388 ordinary shares in the form of 150,000 ordinary shares and 1,092,694 ADSs. In December 2023, we made an amortization payment of 1.3 million, which consisted of 1.1 million of principal and 0.2 million of interest, through the issuance of 2,500,000 ordinary shares and a cash payment of 0.6 million. In April 2024, we issued 3,636,162 ordinary shares in the form of 1,818,081 ADSs to the Convertible Bond Investor, which settled the principal and interest amounts due under the bonds on April 7, 2024. In July 2024, we made an amortization payment of 1.3 million, which consisted of 1.1 million of principal and 0.2 million of interest, through the issuance of 11,557,322 ordinary shares in the form of 2,275,000 ordinary shares and 4,641,161 ADSs. As of September 30, 2024, 11.7 million of principal was outstanding. The securities were issued without registration in reliance upon the exemption provided in Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act.

The Bond Agreement contains a negative pledge covenant that provides that for so long as the principal amount outstanding under the Bonds is equal to or exceeds U.S. 3,000,000, the Company shall not, and will procure that none of its subsidiaries, will, create or permit to subsist any Security Interest (as defined in the Bond Agreement), other than a Permitted Security Interest (as defined in the Bond Agreement), upon the whole or any part of its present or future undertaking, assets or revenues (including any uncalled capital) to secure any Financial Indebtedness (as defined in the Bond Agreement) or to secure any Financial Indebtedness Guarantee (as defined in the Bond Agreement), without at the same time or prior thereto securing the obligations of the Company under the Bonds and the Bond Agreement equally and ratably therewith or providing such other security, guarantees and/or other arrangements for the benefit of holders of the Bonds as may be approved by all of the holders of the Bonds. The Bond Agreement also contains a covenant regarding the incurrence of indebtedness which provides that for so long as the principal amount outstanding under the Bonds is equal to or exceeds U.S. 5,000,000, the Company shall not, and shall procure that its subsidiaries shall not, at any time permit to create, incur, assume or otherwise become liable in respect of any Financial Indebtedness, contingently or otherwise. The Bond also contains negative covenants regarding, among other things, the issuance or paying up any securities, modifying the rights attaching to the ordinary shares; issuing any share capital with rights which are more favorable than the rights attaching to the ordinary shares; modify securities already issued, or grant securities, below a consideration floor; grant or issue securities that could not be legally issued as fully paid; not reduce its share capital, share premium account, or any uncalled liability in respect thereof, or any non-distributable reserves; certain third party offers made to shareholders; and ADSs and the ADS facility. 
 We elected the fair value option to account for the bonds as we believe the fair value option provides users of the consolidated financial statements with greater ability to estimate the outcome of future events as facts and circumstances change, particularly with respect to changes in the fair value of the ordinary shares underlying the conversion option. The fair value of the Notes is determined using a scenario-based analysis that estimates the fair value based on the probability-weighted present value of expected future investment returns, considering each of the possible outcomes available to the noteholders. For each reporting period, changes in the fair value of the notes are recognized through other income (expense) with the portion of the change that results from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk recorded separately in OCI for each reporting period. 
 On September 30, 2024, we announced a restructuring of these bonds. For more information, see - Liquidity and Capital Resources November 2024 Debt Restructurings above. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are a smaller reporting company and not required to provide this information. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer principal executive officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer principal financial officer ), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024, have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as described further below. 
 It should be noted that any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions designed to obtain reasonable (and not absolute) assurance as to its effectiveness, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals. 
 Management does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control systems are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, no evaluation of internal control over financial reporting can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been or will be detected. 
 33 

Remediation of Previously Disclosed Material Weakness 
 In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2024, we concluded that there was a material weakness in the design of our internal control over financial reporting impacting accounting for the mark-to-market adjustment for convertible debt. A material weakness is a significant deficiency, or a combination of significant deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that it is reasonably possible that a material misstatement of the annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness was related to an error in the mark-to-market adjustment to our convertible debt that had been elected under the fair value option, which resulted in insufficient expense recognition. The deficiency arose due to the high complexity and technical nature of the convertible debt instrument and due to the lack of technical expertise. This material weakness resulted in adjustments to expense and equity which were recorded prior to the issuance of the consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2024. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we executed our remediation plan by engaging a third-party advisory firm to help navigate the complexity of the convertible debt. We have also implemented controls to include senior management review of the transactions. These efforts ensure that our financial records are managed appropriately but also help ensure that the appropriate level of review is performed. We have concluded that the applicable remediated controls are designed, implemented and operating effectively. 
 As a result of these remediation activities we concluded the previously reported material weakness have been remediated as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Besides the remediation of the previously disclosed material weakness in the design of our internal control over financial reporting impacting accounting for the mark-to-market adjustment for convertible debt, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings. 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, you should carefully consider the risk factors and other cautionary statements described under the heading Item 1A. Risk Factors included in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our other SEC filings, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. 
 Our future capital needs are uncertain, and our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed in its report on our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital, our operations could be curtailed if we are unable to obtain the required additional funding when needed. We may not be able to do so when necessary, and/or the terms of any financings may not be advantageous to us. 
 Our financial statements included in this report have been prepared assuming we will continue to operate as a going concern. However, due to our recurring losses from operations, and working capital deficiency, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Because we expect to continue to experience negative cash flow, our ability to continue as a going concern is subject to our ability to obtain necessary funding from outside sources, including obtaining additional funding from offerings of our equity securities or debt, transactions involving product development, licensing or collaboration, or other forms of financing. Management intends to continue its efforts to contain costs and to raise additional capital until we can generate sufficient cash from commercial sales to support operations, if ever. If we are unable to obtain sufficient financing, we may be required to delay, scale back or discontinue one or more product development programs, curtail our commercialization activities and significantly reduce expenses or we may not be able to continue as a going concern. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed in its auditors report on the financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K a substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and in this report do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the uncertainty regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. If we cannot continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our financial statements, and our shareholders may lose their entire investment in our securities. Further, the perception that we may be unable to continue as a going concern may impede our ability to pursue strategic opportunities or operate our business due to concerns regarding our ability to discharge our contractual obligations. Future reports from our independent registered public accounting firm may also contain statements expressing doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we raised an additional 14.9 million, net of expenses, to fund the operations of the company going forward. While the company plans to operate the business well beyond 12 months with this capital, there can be no guarantees that we will be successful in those plans. We have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect or may fail in our efforts to enact additional cost reduction options. Furthermore, our operating plan may change, and we may need additional funds sooner than planned in order to meet operational needs and capital requirements for product development and commercialization.
