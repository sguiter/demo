 Performance Restricted Stock Units 
 
 The Company maintains Performance Restricted Stock Units ("PRSUs") that have been granted to select executives and senior officers. The ultimate payout of these PRSUs may vary between and of the target award, based on the Company s performance over a period based on specific metrics approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company. 
 
 For 2023, the Compensation Committee used the following performance metrics for PRSUs approved in that year. 
 
 1. Free Cash Flow defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant, equipment and intangible assets and is subject to adjustments approved by the Compensation Committee. 
 2. Adjusted EBITDA defined as net income attributable to the Company plus: interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense and certain acquisition related costs (including transaction due diligence costs and adjustments to the fair value of contingent consideration), foreign exchange (gain) loss and, if applicable, certain special items which are noted. 
 3. Revenue 
 
 For PRSUs awarded in 2024, the Compensation Committee utilized the same metrics as 2023 PRSUs, but with revised performance goals. 
 
 PRSUs are equity-classified and compensation costs related to PRSUs with performance conditions are initially measured using the fair value of the underlying stock at the date of grant. Compensation costs related to the PRSUs with performance conditions are subsequently adjusted for changes in the expected outcomes of the performance conditions. Compensation cost related to the PRSUs with a market condition is not reversed if the market condition is not achieved, provided the employee requisite service has been rendered. Earned PRSUs generally vest ratably in four equal annual installments over the following completion of the performance period, for a total requisite service period of up to , and have no dividend rights.

 Foreign currency translation ) ) Balance at September 30, 2024 
 
 The Company reviews goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit basis on October 1 of each year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2023, a triggering event was identified within the Company's reporting units within the International segment due to decreased gross margin in the current period as a result of inflationary pressures and rising energy costs impacting the International reporting units' operations. As a result, the Company performed an interim quantitative goodwill impairment test. 
 
 In performing the interim quantitative goodwill impairment test and consistent with prior practice, the Company determined the fair value of each of the reporting units using a combination of the income approach and the market approach by assessing each of these valuation methodologies based upon availability and relevance of comparable company data and determining the appropriate weighting. 
 
 Under the income approach, the fair value for each of the reporting units was determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. The Company used internal forecasts, updated for recent events, to estimate future cash flows using a terminal value calculation, which incorporates historical and forecasted trends, including an estimate of long-term future growth rates, based on the Company s most recent views of the long-term outlook for each reporting unit. The Company's internal forecasts include assumptions about future profitability, including the expected demand for the Company s goods and services. Due to the inherent uncertainties involved in making estimates and assumptions, actual results may differ from those assumed in the forecasts. The Company derived the discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to the reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing. The Company used discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainties inherent in the respective businesses and in the Company's internally developed forecasts and which are updated for recent events. Increased interest rates in the current period increased the discount rate associated with the reporting units which contributed to an unfavorable decrease in the reporting units value. 
 
 The market approach valuation was derived from metrics of publicly traded companies or historically completed transactions of comparable businesses. The selection of comparable businesses was based on the markets in which the reporting units operate, considering risk profiles, size, geography, and diversity of products and services. 
 
 Based upon the results of the interim quantitative goodwill impairment test, the Company recorded an impairment charge of million within the International reporting units. The impairment was calculated based on the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the reporting units. Any significant adverse changes in future periods to the Company s internal forecasts or the external market conditions, if any, could reasonably be expected to negatively affect its key assumptions and may result in future goodwill impairment charges which could be material. 
 
 The Company performed a quantitative annual impairment test as of October 1, 2023 and the Company did not identify any changes in circumstances that would indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. Additionally, through September 30, 2024, the Company did not identify any changes in circumstances that would indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. Significant adverse changes in future periods could negatively affect the Company's key assumptions and may result in future goodwill impairment charges which could be material.

 Senior Credit Facility 
 
 On August 1, 2022, the Company entered into a new credit agreement (the Credit Agreement which provides the Company with a million committed revolving credit facility and a million term loan with a balance of million as of September 30, 2024. The Credit Agreement permits the Company to borrow up to million in non-U.S. dollar currencies and to use up to million of the credit limit for the issuance of letters of credit. Both the revolving line of credit and the term loan under the Credit Agreement have a maturity date of July 30, 2027. 
 
 The Credit Agreement has the following key terms, conditions and financial covenants: 
 
 Borrowings bear interest at Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") plus a credit spread adjustment and applicable SOFR margin ranging from to , based upon our Total Consolidated Debt Leverage Ratio (defined below); under the Prior Credit Agreement, the margin was based upon the LIBOR margin. 
 Total Consolidated Debt Leverage Ratio means the ratio of (a) Total Consolidated Debt to (b) EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the trailing four consecutive fiscal quarters. 
 Total Consolidated Debt means all indebtedness (including subordinated debt) of the Company on a consolidated basis. 
 
 The Company has the benefit of the lowest SOFR margin if its Total Consolidated Debt Leverage Ratio is equal to or less than to 1.0, and the margin increases as the ratio increases, to the maximum margin if the ratio is greater than to 1.0. The Credit Agreement is secured by liens on substantially all the assets of the Company and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries and is guaranteed by those U.S. subsidiaries. 
 
 The Company is required to maintain a Total Consolidated Debt Leverage Ratio of no more than to 1.0 at the end of each quarter through June 30, 2023 and stepping down to a maximum permitted ratio of no more than to 1.0 for the remainder of the term. 
 
 The Company is required to maintain a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of to 1.0 for the duration of the Credit Agreement, as defined in the Credit Agreement. 
 
 The Credit Agreement limits the Company s ability to, among other things, create liens, make investments, incur more indebtedness, merge or consolidate, make dispositions of property, pay dividends, make distributions to stockholders or repurchase our stock, enter into a new line of business, enter into transactions with affiliates and enter into burdensome agreements. 
 
 The Credit Agreement does not limit the Company s ability to acquire other businesses or companies except that the acquired business or company must be in the Company's line of business, the Company must be in compliance with

Overview 
 
 We are a leading "one source" multinational provider of integrated technology-enabled asset protection solutions, helping to maximize the safety and operational uptime for civilization s most critical industrial and civil assets. 
 
 Backed by an innovative, data-driven asset protection portfolio, proprietary technologies, and decades-long legacy of industry leadership, the Company helps clients with asset-intensive infrastructure in the oil and gas, aerospace and defense, industrials, power generation and transmission (including alternative and renewable energy), other process industries and infrastructure, research and engineering and other industries towards achieving and maintaining operational excellence. By supporting these organizations that help fuel our vehicles and power our society; inspecting components that are trusted for commercial, defense, and space craft; and building real-time monitoring systems to help avoid catastrophic incidents, the Company helps the world at large. 
 
 The Company enhances value for its clients by integrating asset protection throughout supply chains and centralizing integrity data through a suite of Industrial Internet of Things ("IoT")-connected digital software and monitoring solutions, including

 (tabular dollars are in thousands) 

OneSuite , which serves as an ecosystem platform, pulling together all of the Company s software and data services capabilities, for the benefit of its customers. 
 
 The Company s core capabilities also include non-destructive testing NDT field inspections enhanced by advanced robotics, laboratory quality control and assurance testing, sensing technologies and NDT equipment, asset and mechanical integrity engineering services, and light mechanical maintenance and access services. 
 
 Our operations consist of three reportable segments: North America, International, and Products and Systems. 
 
 North America provides asset protection solutions predominantly in North America, with the largest concentration in the United States, followed by Canada, consisting primarily of NDT, inspection, mechanical and engineering services that are used to evaluate the structural integrity and reliability of critical energy, industrial and public infrastructure and commercial aerospace components. Software, digital and data services are included in this segment. 
 International offers services, products and systems similar to those of the other segments to select markets within Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and South America, but not to customers in China and South Korea, which are served by the Products and Systems segment. 
 Products and Systems designs, manufactures, sells, installs and services the Company s asset protection products and systems, including equipment and instrumentation, predominantly in the United States. 
 
 Given the role our solutions play in enhancing the safe and efficient operation of infrastructure, we have historically provided a majority of our solutions to our customers on a regular, recurring basis. We perform these services largely at our customers facilities, while primarily servicing our aerospace customers at our network of state-of-the-art, in-house laboratories. These solutions typically include NDT and inspection services, and can also include a wide range of mechanical services, including heat tracing, pre-inspection insulation stripping, coating applications, re-insulation, engineering assessments and long-term condition-monitoring. Under this business model, many customers outsource their inspection to us on a run and maintain basis. We have established long-term relationships as a critical solutions provider to many of the leading companies with asset-intensive infrastructure in our target markets. These markets include companies in the oil and gas, aerospace and defense, industrials, power generation and transmission (including alternative and renewable energy), other process industries and infrastructure, research and engineering and other industries. 
 
 We have focused on providing our advanced asset protection solutions to our customers using proprietary, technology-enabled software and testing instruments, including those developed by our Products and Systems segment. We have made numerous acquisitions in an effort to grow our base of experienced, certified personnel, expand our service lines and technical capabilities, increase our geographical reach, complement our existing offerings, and leverage our fixed costs. We have increased our capabilities and the size of our customer base through the development of applied technologies and managed support services, organic growth and the integration of acquired companies. These acquisitions have provided us with additional service lines, technologies, resources and customers which we believe will enhance our advantages over our competition. 
 
 We believe long-term growth can be realized in our target markets. Our level of business and financial results are impacted by world-wide macro- and micro-economic conditions generally, as well as those within our target markets. Among other things, we expect the timing of our oil and gas customers inspection spend to be impacted by oil price fluctuations. 
 
 We have continued providing our customers with an innovative asset protection software ecosystem through our MISTRAS OneSuite platform. The software platform offers functions of MISTRAS' popular software and services brands as integrated apps on a cloud environment. OneSuite serves as a single access portal for customers' data activities and provides access to 90 plus applications being offered on one centralized platform. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 
 The Company provides products and services to countries throughout the Middle East, where lawfully permitted, and in accordance with United States regulations. We continue to monitor the on-going conflicts throughout the Middle East. These conflicts caused disruptions in the Company's European operations in 2023 with increased costs associated with higher energy

 (tabular dollars are in thousands) 

costs, amongst others. These disruptions have largely subsided in 2024 and the Company will continue to monitor market conditions and respond accordingly. 
 
 Our cash position and liquidity remains strong. As of September 30, 2024, the cash balance was approximately 20.4 million, and with our Credit Agreement, provides us with significant liquidity. 
 
 In April 2021, the Biden Administration announced aggressive initiatives to battle climate change, which includes a significant reduction in the use of fossil fuels and a transition to electric vehicles and increased use of alternative energy. Any legislation or regulations that may be adopted to implement these measures may negatively impact our customers in the oil and gas market over the long-term, which presently is our largest market, although this initiative will likely benefit the alternative energy market, such as wind energy, for which we provide products and services. At this time, it is difficult to determine the magnitude and timing of the impact that climate change initiatives and legislation, if any, will have on these markets and the resulting impact on our business and operational results. 
 
 The Company is currently unable to predict with certainty the overall impact that the factors discussed above and the effect of inflationary pressures may have on its business, results of operations or liquidity or in other ways which the Company cannot yet determine. The Company s European operations are currently experiencing higher energy costs, among other increased costs, due in part to the Russian-Ukrainian war and the conflict in the Middle East between Israel and Hamas. The Company will continue to monitor market conditions and respond accordingly. 

Note About Non-GAAP Measures 
 
 The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). In this MD A under the heading "Income (loss) from Operations", the non-GAAP financial performance measure "Income (loss) from operations before special items is used for each of our three operating segments, the Corporate segment and the "Total Company", with tables reconciling the measure to a financial measure under GAAP. This presentation excludes from "Income (loss) from Operations" (a) transaction expenses related to acquisitions, such as professional fees and due diligence costs, (b) the net changes in the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration liabilities, (c) impairment charges, (d) reorganization and other costs, which includes items such as severance, labor relations matters and asset and lease termination costs and (e) other special items. These adjustments have been excluded from the GAAP measure because these expenses and credits are not related to our or any individual segment's core business operations. The acquisition related costs and special items can be a net expense or credit in any given period. Our management uses this non-GAAP measure as a measure of operating performance and liquidity to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis, as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations. We believe investors and other users of our financial statements benefit from the presentation of this non-GAAP measure in evaluating our performance. Income (loss) before special items excludes the identified adjustments, which provides additional tools to compare our core business operating performance on a consistent basis and measure underlying trends and results in our business. Income (loss) before special items is not used to determine incentive compensation for executives or employees, nor is it a replacement for the reported GAAP financial performance and/or necessarily comparable to the non-GAAP financial measures of other companies. Any measure that eliminates the foregoing items has material limitations as a performance or liquidity measure and should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Because Income (loss) from operations before special items may not be calculated in the same manner by all companies, this measure may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Three Months 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, income from operations (GAAP) increased 16.5 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, while income from operations before special items (non-GAAP) increased 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of revenue, income from operations before special items increased by 60 basis points to 7.2 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 6.6 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Nine months 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, income from operations (GAAP) increased 32.0 million, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, while income from operations before special items (non-GAAP) increased 15.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of revenue, income from operations before special items increased by 260 basis points to 5.9 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.3 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company experienced overall organic growth as well as decreased reorganization costs. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 
 Interest expense was approximately 4.3 million and 4.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest expense was approximately 13.1 million and 12.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period was due to an increase in the interest rates. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 Our effective income tax rate was approximately 29.0 and (16.8) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our effective income tax rate was approximately 22.1 and (1.6) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 The effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was higher than the statutory rate primarily due to the impact of permanent items in the period. The effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was lower than the statutory rate due to the impact of permanent tax adjustments related to executive compensation and goodwill impairments. 
 
 The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was higher than the statutory rate due primarily to the impact of permanent items. The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was lower than the statutory rate due primarily to an unfavorable discrete item related to stock compensation. 
 
 Income tax expense varies as a function of pre-tax income and the level of non-deductible expenses, such as certain amounts of meals and entertainment expense, valuation allowances, and other permanent differences. It is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year but are not consistent from year to year. Our effective income tax rate may fluctuate over the next few years due to many variables including the amount and future geographic distribution of our pre-tax income, changes resulting from our acquisition strategy, and increases or decreases in our permanent differences.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Cash flows are summarized in the table below: Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 24,471 10,684 Investing activities (17,152) (15,170) Financing activities (6,247) (1,839) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,642 (1,411) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 2,714 (7,736) 
 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 24.5 million, representing a year-on-year increase of 13.8 million, or 129 . The increase was primarily related to reduced net working capital, as well as improved operating results, in the current period. 
 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 17.2 million, compared to 15.2 million net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily attributable to purchase of intangible assets during the current period as compared to the prior period. 
 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 6.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash used in financing activities of 1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was a result of higher net repayments of debt of 3.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period. 
 
 Effect of Exchange Rate Changes on Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 
 The effect of exchange rate changes on our cash and cash equivalents was an increase of 1.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a decrease of 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary driver of the change was foreign currency fluctuations related to the Euro and the US Dollar. 
 
 Cash Balance and Credit Facility Borrowings 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 20.4 million and 109.9 million of unused commitments under our Credit Agreement with borrowings of 186.8 million and 3.1 million of letters of credit outstanding. We finance operations primarily through our existing cash balances, cash collected from operations, bank borrowings and capital lease financing. We believe these sources are sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the terms of the Credit Agreement and will continuously monitor our compliance with the covenants contained in the Credit Agreement. 
 
 The terms of our Credit Agreement are described in Note 12- Long-Term Debt of the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, under the heading " Senior Credit Facility ".
