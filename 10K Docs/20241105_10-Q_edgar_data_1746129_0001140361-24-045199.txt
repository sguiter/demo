ITEM 2. 

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included
 elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Unless the context indicates otherwise, references in this management s discussion and analysis to we, our, and us, refer to Bank7
 Corp. and its consolidated subsidiaries. All references to the Bank refer to Bank7, our wholly owned subsidiary.

General 

We are Bank7 Corp., a bank holding company headquartered in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Bank7, we operate twelve locations in Oklahoma, the Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas metropolitan
 area and Kansas. We are focused on serving business owners and entrepreneurs by delivering fast, consistent and well-designed loan and deposit products to meet their financing needs. We intend to grow organically by selectively opening additional
 branches in our target markets and pursuing strategic acquisitions.

As a bank holding company, we generate most of our revenue from interest income on loans and from short-term investments. The primary source of funding for
 our loans and short-term investments are deposits held by our subsidiary, Bank7. We measure our performance by our return on average equity, earnings per share, capital ratios, efficiency ratio (calculated by dividing noninterest expense by the
 sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis) and noninterest income.

Q3 2024 Overview 

We reported total loans of 1.44 billion as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 44.8 million, or 3.2 , from September 30, 2023. Total deposits were 1.52 billion as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 69.4
 million, or 4.4 , as compared to September 30, 2023.

Pre-tax net income was 15.5 million, an increase of 5.3 million, or 51.9 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to pre-tax net income of 10.2 million for the same period in 2023. Pre-tax
 net income was 45.6 million, an increase of 10.0 million, or 28.0 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to pre-tax net income of 35.7 million for the same period in 2023.

Return on average assets and return on average equity was 2.73 and 23.67 , respectively for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.82 and 18.89 , respectively, for the same period in 2023.
 Return on average assets and return on average equity was 2.68 and 24.79 , respectively for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2.19 and 23.29 , respectively, for the same period in 2023. Our efficiency ratio for the three
 months ended September 30, 2024 was 37.87 as compared to 33.61 for the same period in 2023. Our efficiency ratio for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 37.58 as compared to 35.05 for the same period in 2023.

The provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 4.2 million, or 100.0 , as compared to the same period in 2023. The provision for credit losses for the nine months ended
 September 30, 2024 decreased 5.6 million or 100.0 , as compared to the same period in 2023. The provision expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was related to loan growth in the first quarter of 2023, the impact of updated
 economic assumptions, and we had a single loan customer that filed for bankruptcy, and as a result, we recorded an additional allowance for credit losses of 3.0 million.

Securities 

Our investment portfolio consists entirely of securities classified as available-for-sale. As a result, the carrying values of our investment securities are adjusted for unrealized gain or loss, and any gain or
 loss is reported on an after-tax basis as a component of other comprehensive income in shareholders equity.

We evaluate our available-for-sale securities portfolio on a quarterly basis for potential credit-related losses. We assess potential credit losses by comparing the fair value of a debt security to its amortized
 cost basis. If the fair value of a debt security is greater than the amortized cost basis, no allowance for credit losses is recognized. If the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, we review the factors to determine if the
 impairment is credit-related or noncredit-related. For debt securities we intend to sell or are more likely than not required to sell, before the recovery of their amortized cost basis, the difference between fair value and amortized cost is
 impaired and is recognized through earnings. For debt securities we do not intend to sell or are more likely than not required to sell, prior to expected recovery of amortized cost basis, the credit portion of the impairment is recognized through
 earnings, with a corresponding entry to an allowance for credit losses, and the noncredit portion is recognized through accumulated other comprehensive income.

The following table summarizes the maturity distribution schedule with corresponding weighted average taxable equivalent yields of the debt securities portfolio at
 September 30, 2024. The following table presents securities at their expected maturities, which may differ from contractual maturities. The Company manages its debt securities portfolio for liquidity, as a tool to execute its asset/liability
 management strategy, and for pledging requirements for public funds:

Provision for Credit Losses 

Credit risk is inherent in the business of making loans. We establish an Allowance for credit losses Allowance through charges to earnings, which are shown in the statements of comprehensive
 income as the provision for credit losses. The provision for credit losses and level of Allowance for each period are dependent upon many factors, including loan growth, net charge-offs, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio,
 delinquencies, management s assessment of the quality of the loan portfolio, and the valuation of problems and the general economic conditions in our market areas.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023:

- 

The provision for credit losses decreased from 4.2 million to 0; and

- 

The allowance as a percentage of gross loans decreased by 24 basis points to 1.24 .

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023:

- 

The provision for credit losses decreased from 5.6 million to 0; and

Our loans represent the largest portion of our earning assets. The quality and diversification of the loan portfolio is an important consideration when reviewing our
 financial condition. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, our gross loans were 1.44 billion and 1.36 billion, respectively.

We have established internal concentration limits in the loan portfolio for Commercial Real Estate (CRE) loans, hospitality loans, energy loans, and construction loans, among others. All loan types are within our
 established limits. We use underwriting guidelines to assess each borrower s historical cash flow to determine debt service capabilities, and we further stress test the customer s debt service capability under higher interest rate scenarios as
 well as other underlying macro-economic factors. Financial and performance covenants are used in commercial lending to allow us to react to a borrower s deteriorating financial condition, should that occur.

Allowance for Credit and Lease Losses 

The allowance is based on management s estimate of potential losses inherent in the loan portfolio. In the opinion of management, the allowance is adequate to absorb estimated losses in the portfolio as of each
 balance sheet date. While management uses available information to analyze losses on loans, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part
 of their examination process, periodically review the Company s allowance. In analyzing the adequacy of the allowance, a comprehensive loan grading system to determine risk potential in loans is utilized together with the results of internal
 credit reviews.

To determine the adequacy of the allowance, the loan portfolio is broken into segments based on loan type. Historical loss experience factors by segment, adjusted for changes in trends and conditions, are used to
 determine an indicated allowance for each portfolio segment. These factors are evaluated and updated based on the composition of the specific loan segment. Other considerations include volumes and trends of delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, levels
 of bankruptcies, criticized and classified loan trends, expected losses on real estate secured loans, new credit products and policies, economic conditions, concentrations of credit risk and the experience and abilities of our lending personnel.

The allowance was 17.9 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 19.7 million at December 31, 2023.

Nonperforming Assets 

Loans are considered delinquent when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more. Delinquent loans may remain on accrual status between 30 days and 90 days past due. Loans on which the accrual of
 interest has been discontinued are designated as nonaccrual loans. Typically, the accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when principal or interest payments are past due 90 days or when, in the opinion of management, there is a reasonable
 doubt as to collectability of the obligation. When loans are placed on nonaccrual status, all interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current period interest income. Income on a nonaccrual loan is subsequently recognized
 only to the extent that cash is received and the loan s principal balance is deemed collectible. Loans are restored to accrual status when loans become well-secured and management believes full collectability of principal and interest is
 probable.

Real estate we acquire as a result of foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is classified as other real estate owned, or OREO, until sold, and is initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when
 acquired, establishing a new cost basis.

Table of Contents 

In addition to the past due and nonaccrual criteria, we also evaluate loans according to our internal risk grading system. Loans are segregated between pass, watch, special mention, and substandard categories. The
 definitions of those categories are as follows:

Pass : These loans generally conform to Bank policies, are characterized by policy-conforming advance rates on collateral, and have well-defined repayment sources. In
 addition, these credits are extended to borrowers and guarantors with a strong balance sheet and either substantial liquidity or a reliable income history.

Watch : These loans are still considered Pass credits; however, various factors such as industry stress, material changes in cash flow or financial conditions, or
 deficiencies in loan documentation, or other risk issues determined by the lending officer, Commercial Loan Committee or Credit Quality Committee warrant a heightened sense and frequency of monitoring.

Special mention : These loans have observable weaknesses or evidence of imprudent handling or structural issues. The weaknesses require close attention, and the remediation
 of those weaknesses is necessary. No risk of probable loss exists. Credits in this category are expected to quickly migrate to Watch or Substandard as this is viewed as a transitory loan grade.

Substandard : These loans are not adequately protected by the sound worth and debt service capacity of the borrower, but may be well-secured. The loans have defined
 weaknesses relative to cash flow, collateral, financial condition or other factors that might jeopardize repayment of all of the principal and interest on a timely basis. There is the possibility that a future loss will occur if weaknesses are
 not remediated.

Outstanding loan balances categorized by internal risk grades as of the periods indicated are summarized as follows:

Deposits 

We gather deposits primarily through our twelve branch locations and online through our website. We offer a variety of deposit products including demand deposit accounts and interest-bearing products, such as
 savings accounts and certificates of deposit. We put continued effort into gathering noninterest-bearing demand deposit accounts through loan production cross-selling, customer referrals, marketing efforts and various involvement with community
 networks. Some of our interest-bearing deposits are obtained through brokered transactions. We participate in the CDARS and ICS programs, where customer funds are placed into multiple deposit accounts, each in an amount under the standard FDIC
 insurance maximum of 250,000, and placed at a network of banks across the United States.

Total deposits as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 1.52 billion and 1.59 billion, respectively.

Uninsured deposits are defined as the portion of deposit accounts in U.S. offices that exceed the FDIC insurance limit and amounts in any other uninsured investment or deposit account that are classified as
 deposits and are not subject to any federal or state deposit insurance regimes. Total uninsured deposits were 344.6 million and 448.7 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, as calculated per regulatory guidance. This
 was approximately 22.6 and 28.2 of deposits at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Liquidity

Liquidity refers to our ability to meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, while at the same time meeting our operating, capital and strategic cash flow needs, all at a reasonable cost. We continuously monitor our
 liquidity position to ensure that assets and liabilities are managed in a manner that will meet all short-term and long-term cash requirements. We manage our liquidity position to meet the daily cash flow needs of customers, while maintaining an
 appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to meet the return on investment objectives of our shareholders.

Our liquidity position is supported by the management of liquid assets and access to alternative sources of funds. Our liquid assets include cash, interest-bearing deposits in correspondent banks and fed funds sold. Other available sources of
 liquidity include wholesale deposits and borrowings from correspondent banks and FHLB advances.

Our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements are primarily met through cash flow from operations, redeployment of prepaying and maturing balances in our loan portfolios, and increases in customer deposits. Other alternative sources of
 funds will supplement these primary sources to the extent necessary to meet additional liquidity requirements on either a short-term or long-term basis.

As of September 30, 2024, we had no unsecured fed funds lines with correspondent depository institutions, with no corresponding amounts advanced. In addition, based on the values of loans pledged as collateral, we had borrowing availability
 with the FHLB of 192.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and 159.2 million as of December 31, 2023, and we had access to approximately 367.7 million in liquidity with the Federal Reserve Bank as of September 30, 2024 and 0 as of December 31,
 2023.

Capital Requirements

The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal and state banking regulators. Failure to meet regulatory capital requirements may result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary
 actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action (described below), We must meet specific
 capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting policies. The capital amounts and classifications are subject to qualitative judgments
 by the federal banking regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Qualitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require us to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Common Equity Tier 1 CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, total capital to risk-weighted assets, and Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets, referred to as the leverage ratio. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Bank was in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements and categorized as well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action frame work. There have
 been no conditions or events since September 30, 2024 that management believes would change this classification. The table below presents our applicable capital requirements, as well as our capital ratios as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,
 2023. The Company exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and the Bank was considered to be well-capitalized as of the dates reflected in the tables below.

Basel III Capital Rules

Under the Basel III Capital Rules, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, a banking
 organization must hold a capital conservation buffer composed of CET1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements. As of September 30, 2024, the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III Capital
 Rules.

We believe that we will be able to meet our contractual obligations as they come due through the maintenance of adequate cash levels. We expect to maintain adequate cash levels through profitability, loan repayment
 and maturity activity and continued deposit gathering activities. We have in place various borrowing mechanisms for both short-term and long-term liquidity needs.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit
 and standby letters of credit. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. The contractual or notional amounts of those instruments
 reflect the extent of involvement we have in particular classes of financial instruments.

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other
 termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each customer s
 creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if we deemed necessary upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty. The Company also estimates a reserve for potential
 losses associated with off-balance sheet commitments and letters of credit. It is included in other liabilities in the Company s consolidated statements of condition, with any related provisions to the reserve included in non-interest expense in
 the consolidated statement of income.

In determining the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, a process similar to the one used for the allowance is employed. Based on historical experience, loss factors, adjusted for expected funding, are applied
 to the Company s off-balance sheet commitments and letters of credit to estimate the potential for losses.

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of the customer to a third party. They are intended to be disbursed, subject to certain conditions, upon
 request of the borrower.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP and conform to general practices within the industry in which we operate. To prepare financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management makes estimates,
 assumptions and judgments based on available information. These estimates, assumptions and judgments affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on
 information available as of the date of the financial statements and, as this information changes, actual results could differ from the estimates, assumptions and judgments reflected in the financial statement. In particular, management has
 identified several accounting policies that, due to the estimates, assumptions and judgments inherent in those policies, are critical in understanding our financial statements.

The following is a discussion of the critical accounting policies and significant estimates that we believe require us to make the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments.

Allowance for Credit Losses

The allowance is based on management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. In the opinion of management, the allowance is adequate to absorb estimated losses in the portfolio as of each
 balance sheet date. While management uses available information to analyze losses on loans, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions and changes in the composition of the loan portfolio. In
 addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Bank s allowance. In analyzing the adequacy of the allowance, a comprehensive loan grading system to determine risk potential in
 loans is utilized together with the results of internal credit reviews.

To determine the adequacy of the allowance, the loan portfolio is broken into pools based on loan type and risk characteristics. Historical loss experience factors by pool, adjusted for changes in trends and
 conditions, are used to determine an indicated allowance for each portfolio pool. These factors are evaluated and updated based on the composition of the specific loan pool. Other considerations include volumes and trends of delinquencies,
 nonaccrual loans, levels of bankruptcies, criticized and classified loan trends, expected losses on real estate secured loans, new credit products and policies, economic conditions, concentrations of credit risk and the experience and abilities
 of our lending personnel. In addition to the pool evaluations, classified loans with a balance of 250,000 or more are individually evaluated based on facts and circumstances of the loan to determine if a specific allowance amount may be
 necessary. Specific allowances may also be established for loans whose outstanding balances are below the 250,000 threshold when it is determined that the risk associated with the loan differs significantly from the risk factor amounts
 established for its loan pool.

Goodwill and Intangibles

Intangible assets totaled 907,000 and goodwill, net of accumulated amortization, totaled 8.5 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to intangible assets of 1.0 million and goodwill of 8.5
 million as of December 31, 2023.

Goodwill resulting from a business combination represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of
 the acquisition date. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if other impairment indicators are present. If the implied fair value of goodwill is lower than its carrying amount, a goodwill impairment is indicated and
 goodwill is written down to its implied fair value. Subsequent increases in goodwill value are not recognized in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Other intangible assets consist of core deposit intangible assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis based on an estimated useful life of 10 years. Such assets are periodically evaluated as
 to the recoverability of their carrying values.

Income Taxes

We file a consolidated income tax return. Deferred taxes are recognized under the balance sheet method based upon the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax basis of
 assets and liabilities, using the tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods when the related temporary differences are expected to be realized.

The amount of accrued current and deferred income taxes is based on estimates of taxes due or receivable from taxing authorities either currently or in the future. Changes in these accruals are reported as tax
 expense, and involve estimates of the various components included in determining taxable income, tax credits, other taxes and temporary differences. Changes periodically occur in the estimates due to changes in tax rates, tax laws and regulations
 and implementation of new tax planning strategies. The process of determining the accruals for income taxes necessarily involves the exercise of considerable judgment and consideration of numerous subjective factors.

Management performs an analysis of our tax positions annually and believes it is more likely than not that all of its tax positions will be utilized in future years.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction between market
 participants at the measurement date. The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters. For financial
 instruments that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market parameters, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value. When observable market prices and parameters are not available, management judgment is
 necessary to estimate fair value. In addition, changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or the observable date. Debt securities that are being held for indefinite periods of time and are not intended to sell, are
 classified as available for sale and are stated at estimated fair value. Unrealized gains or losses on debt securities available for sale are reported as a component of stockholders equity and comprehensive income, net of income tax. 

The Company reviews its portfolio of debt securities in an unrealized loss position at least quarterly. The Company first assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more-likely-than-not that it will be required
 to sell, the securities before recovery of the amortized cost basis. If either of these criteria is met, the securities amortized cost basis is written down to fair value as a current period expense. If either of the above criteria is not met,
 the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value is the result of credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers, among other things, the period of time the security has been in an unrealized loss
 position, and performance of any underlying collateral and adverse conditions specifically related to the security.

The estimates of fair values of debt securities and other financial instruments are based on a variety of factors. In some cases, fair values represent quoted market prices for identical or comparable instruments.
 In other cases, fair values have been estimated based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates reflecting varying degrees of risk. Accordingly, the fair values may not represent
 actual values of the financial instruments that could have been realized as of year-end or that will be realized in the future.

ITEM 3. 

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Interest Rate Sensitivity and Market Risk

As a financial institution, our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Our financial management policy provides management with the guidelines for effective funds management,
 and we have established a measurement system for monitoring our net interest rate sensitivity position. We have historically managed our sensitivity position within our established guidelines.

Fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of our assets and liabilities, and the market value of all interest-earning assets and
 interest-bearing liabilities, other than those which have a short term to maturity. Interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes. These economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net
 interest income and/or a loss of current fair market values. The objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximizing income.

We manage our exposure to interest rates by structuring our balance sheet in the ordinary course of business. We do not enter into instruments such as leveraged derivatives, financial options or
 financial future contracts to mitigate interest rate risk from specific transactions. Based upon the nature of our operations, we are not subject to foreign exchange or commodity price risk. We do not own any trading assets.

Our exposure to interest rate risk is managed by the Asset/Liability Committee, or the ALCO Committee, in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors. The ALCO Committee formulates
 strategies based on appropriate levels of interest rate risk. In determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk, the ALCO Committee considers the impact on earnings and capital on the current outlook on interest rates, potential changes
 in interest rates, regional economies, liquidity, business strategies and other factors. The ALCO Committee meets regularly to review, among other things, the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate changes, the book and market
 values of assets and liabilities, commitments to originate loans and the maturities of investments and borrowings. Additionally, the ALCO Committee reviews liquidity, cash flow flexibility, maturities of deposits and consumer and commercial
 deposit activity. Management employs methodologies to manage interest rate risk, which include an analysis of relationships between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and an interest rate shock simulation model.

We use interest rate risk simulation models and shock analyses to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and fair value of equity, and the impact of changes in interest rates on
 other financial metrics. Contractual maturities and re-pricing opportunities of loans are incorporated in the model. The average lives of non-maturity deposit accounts are based on decay assumptions and are incorporated into the model. We utilize
 third-party experts to periodically evaluate the performance of our non-maturity deposit accounts to develop the decay assumptions. All of the assumptions used in our analyses are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot precisely
 measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from the model s simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest
 rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various management strategies.

On a quarterly basis, we run various simulation models including a static balance sheet and dynamic growth balance sheet. These models test the impact on net interest income and fair value of equity
 from changes in market interest rates under various scenarios. Under the static model and dynamic growth models, rates are shocked instantaneously and ramped rates change over a 12-month and 24-month horizon based upon parallel and non-parallel
 yield curve shifts. Parallel shock scenarios assume instantaneous parallel movements in the yield curve compared to a flat yield curve scenario. Non-parallel simulation involves analysis of interest income and expense under various changes in the
 shape of the yield curve. Our internal policy regarding internal rate risk simulations currently specifies that for gradual parallel shifts of the yield curve, estimated net interest income at risk for the subsequent one-year period should not
 decline by more than 10 for a -100 basis point shift, 5 for a 100 basis point shift, 10 for a 200 basis point shift, 15 for a 300 basis point shift, and 20 for a 400 basis point shift.

The results are primarily due to behavior of demand, money market and savings deposits during such rate fluctuations. We have found that, historically, interest rates on these deposits change more
 slowly than changes in the discount and fed funds rates. This assumption is incorporated into the simulation model and is generally not fully reflected in a gap analysis. The assumptions incorporated into the model are inherently uncertain and,
 as a result, the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from the model s simulated results due to
 timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various strategies.

Impact of Inflation

Our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. These require the measurement of financial position and operating results in
 terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative value of money over time due to inflation or recession.

Unlike many industrial companies, substantially all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general
 levels of inflation. Interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services. However, other operating expenses do reflect general levels of inflation.

ITEM 4. 

Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness as of September 30, 2024 of our disclosure controls and procedures, as
 defined Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
 reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management was required to apply judgment in evaluating its controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the fiscal quarter covered by this Form 10-Q.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024
 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, such controls.

PART II

ITEM 1. 

Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, we are a party to legal actions that are routine and incidental to our business. Given the nature, scope and complexity of the extensive legal and regulatory landscape applicable to our business,
 including laws and regulations governing consumer protections, fair lending, fair labor, privacy, information security and anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws, we, like all banking organizations, are subject to heightened legal and
 regulatory compliance and litigation risk. However, based upon available information and in consultation with legal counsel, management is of the opinion that no proceedings exist, either individually or in the aggregate, which, if determined
 adversely, would have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.

ITEM 1A. 

Risk Factors 

In addition to the other information set forth in this Report, we refer you to Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC. Other than the risk
 factors set forth below, there have been no material changes in the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 10b5-1 Plan with pricing and purchasing parameters established by management. The RP expired on October 28, 2023. There were no share repurchases under this plan. On October 30, 2023, the Company adopted a new Repurchase Plan (the New RP that
 authorizes the repurchase of up to 750,000 shares of the Company s stock. Stock repurchases under the New RP will take place pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 Plan with pricing and purchasing parameters established by management. The Company may
 repurchase shares of common stock on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions at times and prices considered appropriate, at the discretion of the Company, and subject to its assessment of alternative uses of capital, stock
 trading price, general market conditions and regulatory factors. The stock repurchase plans do not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares and will continue in effect until terminated by the Board of Directors of the
 Company. Shares of common stock repurchased under these plans will be retired subsequent to acquisition. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no shares purchased under the Company s repurchase plan.
