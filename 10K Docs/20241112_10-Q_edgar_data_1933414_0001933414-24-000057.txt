 Reverse Stock Split 
 On February 1, 2023, the Company effected a one-for-10.798 reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value per share, and a proportional adjustment to the existing conversion ratio of the Company s preferred stock (the Reverse Stock Split). Accordingly, all share and per-share amounts for all periods presented in the accompanying condensed financial statements and notes thereto have been adjusted to reflect this Reverse Stock Split. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Since its inception, the Company has not generated any revenue from product sales or other sources and has incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations. The Company s primary uses of cash to date have been to fund research and development activities, business planning, establishing and maintaining the Company s intellectual property portfolio, hiring personnel, raising capital, and providing general and administrative support for these operations. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of million and cash, cash equivalents, and investments of million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a net loss of million and net cash used in operating activities of million. 
 million from the sale of the Company s common stock, convertible preferred stock, convertible notes, and pre-funded warrants. The Company has a limited operating history, and the sales and income potential of its business is unproven. The Company expects to continue to incur substantial losses in the foreseeable future as a result of the Company s research and development activities. Additional funding will be required in the future to continue with the Company s planned research and development and other activities. The Company expects to finance its operations through equity offerings, debt financings, and other capital sources, including potential strategic collaborations, licensing, and other similar arrangements. The Company believes that its cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to allow the Company to fund operations for at least twelve months from the issuance date of these condensed financial statements.

 million upfront fee and development milestone payments of million in the aggregate. The Company has remaining obligations to pay Mitsubishi Tanabe commercial milestone payments of up to million in the aggregate upon first commercial sale and upon meeting certain annual sales targets, as well as additional commercial milestone payments of up to million for a second indication. Additionally, the Company is obligated to pay Mitsubishi Tanabe tiered royalties at percentages ranging from the mid-single-digits to ten percent of aggregate net sales of each Lorundrostat Product on a Lorundrostat Product-by-Lorundrostat Product and country-by-country basis, until the later of (i) the expiration of the last-to-expire valid Mitsubishi Tanabe patent claim covering a Lorundrostat Product, (ii) from the first commercial sale of a Lorundrostat Product, or (iii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity in such country. Such royalties are subject to reduction under specified conditions, including lack of patent coverage and generic competition. 
 The Company is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct and complete the development activities and to file for regulatory approval for at least one Lorundrostat Product in a major market country and consider in good faith developing at least one Lorundrostat Product in a non-major market country. If the Company elects to sublicense its rights under the Mitsubishi License to a third party with respect to exploitation of lorundrostat or any Lorundrostat Product in certain countries in Asia, the Company has agreed to negotiate such a sublicense first, for a specified period of time, with Mitsubishi Tanabe, if Mitsubishi Tanabe notifies the Company that it would like to obtain such a sublicense. The Company also agreed not to commercialize any competing product prior to following the first commercial sale of the first Lorundrostat Product in any country without Mitsubishi Tanabe s prior consent.

or days prior written notice to Mitsubishi Tanabe depending on whether the Lorundrostat Product has received regulatory approval. Mitsubishi Tanabe may terminate the Mitsubishi License if the Company has not initiated regulatory consultation for the first global clinical trials of lorundrostat in at least one major market country within a specified amount of time or if the Company or its affiliates or sublicensees initiate a challenge to the patent rights licensed to the Company by Mitsubishi Tanabe. In addition, either party may terminate the Mitsubishi License in the event of an uncured material breach by or bankruptcy of the other party, subject to certain notice and cure periods, or upon the other party s bankruptcy or insolvency. 
 The Company incurred and million of research and development expenses pursuant to the Mitsubishi License during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, that related to the Company s initiation of its pivotal clinical program of lorundrostat. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has paid an aggregate of million in development milestone payments and has no remaining development milestone obligations under the Mitsubishi License. 
 Litigation 
 Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties, and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. From time to time, the Company may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company was not subject to any material legal proceedings during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and no material legal proceedings are currently pending or threatened. 
 Indemnification Agreements 
 In the ordinary course of business, the Company may provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to vendors, lessors, business partners, and other parties with respect to certain matters including, but not limited to, losses arising from breach of such agreements or intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with officers of the Company and members of its board of directors that will require the Company, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is, in many cases, unlimited. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications. The Company is not aware of any claims under indemnification arrangements, and it has not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in its condensed financial statements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing medicines to target diseases driven by dysregulated aldosterone. Our clinical-stage product candidate, lorundrostat, is a proprietary, orally administered, highly selective aldosterone synthase inhibitor (ASI) that we are initially developing for the treatment of cardiorenal conditions affected by dysregulated aldosterone, including hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the United States, there are over 115 million patients who have sustained elevated blood pressure (BP), or hypertension, and more than half of this population fails to achieve their BP goals, defined as BP of below 130/80 mmHg, with currently available medications. There are over 30 million treated patients who do not achieve their BP goal, of whom approximately 20 million have systolic BP levels greater than 140 mmHg. Patients with hypertension that persists despite taking two or more medications have 1.8 and 2.5 times greater mortality risk due to either cardiovascular disease or stroke, respectively. In a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial evaluating 200 subjects with uncontrolled hypertension (uHTN) or resistant hypertension (rHTN), lorundrostat demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction in BP with once-daily dosing and was well tolerated. Dysregulated aldosterone levels are a key factor in driving hypertension in approximately 25 of hypertensive patients. In addition to hypertension, we intend to investigate the benefits of lorundrostat in subjects with hypertension and CKD. We believe that our product candidate holds promise to be an innovative solution for the rapidly growing unmet need in multiple cardiorenal metabolic disorders. 
 Clinical Highlights 
 Advance-HTN is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lorundrostat for the treatment of uHTN or rHTN, when used as an add-on therapy to a standardized background treatment of two or three antihypertensive medications with an enrollment target of 261 subjects. Subjects who met screening criteria either discontinued their existing hypertension medications and started on a standard regimen of an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) and a diuretic, if previously on two medications, or a standard regimen of ARB, diuretic and calcium channel blocker if previously on three to five medications. Subjects who remained hypertensive despite the standardized regimen were then randomized into three cohorts for twelve weeks of the following treatment methods: lorundrostat 50 mg QD (once daily), lorundrostat 50 mg QD, and an option to titrate to 100 mg QD at week four based on defined criteria or placebo. The primary endpoint for Advance-HTN is the change in 24-hour ambulatory systolic BP at week twelve from baseline for active cohorts versus placebo. Randomization of subjects was completed in the fourth quarter of 2024, and topline data from this trial is anticipated in March 2025. 
 Our second pivotal trial, Launch-HTN, is a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lorundrostat for the treatment of uHTN or rHTN, when used as an add-on therapy to their existing, prescribed background treatment of two to five antihypertensive medications with a target enrollment of 1,000 adult subjects. Subjects were randomized into three cohorts for twelve weeks of the following treatment methods: lorundrostat 50 mg QD, lorundrostat 50 mg QD, and an option to titrate to 100 mg QD at week six based on defined criteria or placebo. The primary endpoint of the trial is the assessment of automated office measured systolic BP from baseline for active cohorts versus placebo at six weeks, with the results pooled for all subjects on 50 mg QD. Randomization of subjects was completed in the fourth quarter of 2024, and topline data from this trial is anticipated to be available in mid first half of 2025. 
 Explore-CKD is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, two-period, two-sequence (2x2) crossover trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 25 mg QD lorundrostat in addition to an SGLT2 inhibitor for the treatment of hypertension in subjects with Stage 2 to 3b CKD and albuminuria despite receiving stable treatment with an ACEi or ARB. The primary endpoint is placebo-adjusted change from baseline in systolic BP at week four and an exploratory endpoint is placebo-adjusted percent change from 
 18 

Table of Contents 

 baseline in urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio at week four. As this is an exploratory trial, interim data analyses may be conducted at one or more points in time. Enrollment is ongoing under the amended protocol, and topline data from this trial is anticipated in the second quarter of 2025. 
 Transform-HTN is an open-label extension trial allowing subjects to continue to receive lorundrostat and to obtain long-term efficacy and safety data. All subjects in the pivotal hypertension program, including the Advance-HTN and Launch-HTN trials, as well as the Explore-CKD trial, will be given the opportunity to participate in the extension trial. 
 Lorundrostat has been developed to normalize the production of aldosterone, and we believe this mechanism can be applied to other indications where dysregulated aldosterone biology plays a role. 
 Financial Overview 
 We commenced our operations in May 2019 and have devoted substantially all of our resources to date to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, in-licensing our product candidate, lorundrostat, establishing our intellectual property portfolio, conducting research, preclinical studies, and clinical trials, and providing other general and administrative support for our operations. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, and investments of 263.6 million. From inception through the date of this Quarterly Report, we raised aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 498.8 million from the sale of common stock, convertible preferred stock, convertible notes, and pre-funded warrants. In February 2023, we completed our initial public offering (IPO) of 13,800,000 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of 16.00 per share, including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase 1,800,000 additional shares of our common stock. Including the option exercise, our aggregate net proceeds from the IPO were approximately 201.4 million, net of underwriting discounts, commissions, and offering costs. In February 2024, we sold 8,339,169 shares of common stock and, to certain purchasers, 549,755 pre-funded warrants to purchase common stock for aggregate net proceeds of approximately 116.1 million, net of offering expenses, in a private placement offering (the Private Placement). 
 We do not have any products approved for sale, have not generated any revenue, and have incurred net losses since our inception. Our operations to date have been limited to business planning, raising capital, in-licensing and developing lorundrostat, conducting clinical trials, and other research and development activities. Our net losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 128.9 million and 47.5 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of 253.6 million and 124.7 million, respectively. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year, depending on the timing of our clinical development activities and other research and development activities. We expect our expenses and operating losses will increase substantially as we conduct our ongoing and planned clinical trials for lorundrostat, potentially seek regulatory approval for lorundrostat and any future product candidates we may develop, expand our clinical, regulatory, quality, manufacturing, and commercialization capabilities, obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property, expand our general and administrative support functions, including hiring additional personnel, and incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. 
 Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our cash, cash equivalents, and investments will be sufficient to allow us to fund our operations for at least twelve months. We have never generated any revenue and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete the development of, and obtain regulatory approval for, lorundrostat, which will not be for several years, if ever. Accordingly, until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of lorundrostat, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through equity offerings, debt financings, or other capital sources, including potential collaborations, licenses, and other similar arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and could force us to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our product development or future

 commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. For more information, see Liquidity and Capital Resources . 
 License Agreement with Mitsubishi Tanabe 
 In July 2020, we entered into a license agreement (the Mitsubishi License) with Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharmaceutical Company (Mitsubishi Tanabe), pursuant to which Mitsubishi Tanabe granted us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license under Mitsubishi Tanabe s patent and other intellectual property rights to exploit products incorporating lorundrostat (formerly MT-4129) (Lorundrostat Products) for the prevention, treatment, diagnosis, detection, monitoring, or predisposition testing with respect to indications, diseases, and conditions in humans. Pursuant to the Mitsubishi License, we paid Mitsubishi Tanabe a 1.0 million upfront fee and development milestone payments of 9.0 million in the aggregate. We have remaining obligations to pay Mitsubishi Tanabe commercial milestone payments of up to 155.0 million in the aggregate upon first commercial sale and upon meeting certain annual sales targets, as well as additional commercial milestone payments of up to 10.0 million for a second indication. Additionally, we are obligated to pay Mitsubishi Tanabe tiered royalties at percentages ranging from the mid-single digits to ten percent (10 of aggregate net sales of each Lorundrostat Product on a Lorundrostat Product-by-Lorundrostat Product and country-by-country basis, until the later of (i) the expiration of the last-to-expire valid Mitsubishi Tanabe patent claim covering a Lorundrostat Product, (ii) ten years from the first commercial sale of a Lorundrostat Product, or (iii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity in such country. Such royalties are subject to reduction under specified conditions, including lack of patent coverage and generic competition. We incurred 0 and 4.0 million of research and development expenses pursuant to the Mitsubishi License during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, that related to the initiation of our pivotal clinical program of lorundrostat. As of September 30, 2024, we have paid an aggregate of 9.0 million in development milestone payments and have no remaining development milestone obligations under the Mitsubishi License. 
 We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct and complete the development activities and to file for regulatory approval for at least one Lorundrostat Product in a major market country and consider in good faith developing at least one Lorundrostat Product in a non-major market country. If we elect to sublicense our rights under the Mitsubishi License to a third party with respect to exploitation of lorundrostat or any Lorundrostat Product in certain countries in Asia, we have agreed to negotiate such a sublicense first, for a specified period of time, with Mitsubishi Tanabe, if Mitsubishi Tanabe notifies us that it would like to obtain such a sublicense. We also agreed not to commercialize any competing product prior to three years following the first commercial sale of the first Lorundrostat Product in any country without Mitsubishi Tanabe s prior consent. 
 Private Placement Offering 
 On February 7, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with the purchasers named therein (the Purchasers), for the Private Placement of (i) 8,339,169 shares (the Shares) of our common stock at a price of 13.50 per Share, and (ii) with respect to certain Purchasers, Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 549,755 shares of common stock (the Pre-Funded Warrants) in lieu of shares of common stock, at a purchase price of 13.499 per Pre-Funded Warrant (the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Pre-Funded Warrants, the Warrant Shares) for aggregate net proceeds of approximately 116.1 million. We are using the net proceeds from the Private Placement to fund the research and development of lorundrostat and for working capital and general corporate purposes. 
 Each Pre-Funded Warrant has an exercise price of 0.001 per share of common stock, is immediately exercisable on the date of issuance, and will not expire. Under the terms of the Pre-Funded Warrants, we may not effect the exercise of any portion of any Pre-Funded Warrant, and a holder will not have the right to exercise any portion of any Pre-Funded Warrant, which, upon giving effect to such exercise, would cause a holder (together with its affiliates) to own more than a specified beneficial ownership limitation of either 4.99 , 9.99 , or 19.99 (as selected by such holder prior to the issuance of the Pre-Funded Warrant) of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise, as such percentage 
 20 

Table of Contents 

 ownership is determined in accordance with the terms of the Pre-Funded Warrants. However, any holder may increase or decrease such percentage to any other percentage not in excess of 19.99 , provided that any increase in such percentage shall not be effective until 61 days after such notice is delivered to us. 
 We registered the resale of the Shares and the Warrant Shares on a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-278122), which was declared effective by the SEC on April 11, 2024 (the Registration Statement). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to keep the Registration Statement effective until the earliest of (i) the time as all of the Shares and Warrant Shares purchased by the Purchasers pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement have been sold pursuant to the Registration Statement, or (ii) such time as the Shares and Warrant Shares become eligible for resale by non-affiliates without any volume limitations or other restrictions pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect. 
 At Market Equity Offering Sales Agreement 
 On March 21, 2024, we entered into an ATM Equity Offering Sales Agreement (the ATM Agreement) with BofA Securities, Inc. and Evercore Group L.L.C. as our sales agents (the Agents) and/or principals. Pursuant to the terms of the ATM Agreement, we may sell from time to time through the Agents shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 100,000,000 (the ATM Shares). Any ATM Shares will be issued pursuant to the Registration Statement. Sales of the ATM Shares, if any, will be made by means of ordinary brokers transactions on the Nasdaq Global Select Market or as otherwise agreed by us and the Agents. Under the terms of the ATM Agreement, we may also sell the ATM Shares from time to time to an Agent as principal for its own account at a price to be agreed upon at the time of sale. Any sale of the ATM Shares to an Agent as principal would be pursuant to the terms of a separate terms agreement between us and such Agent. We have not yet sold any ATM Shares as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Key Components of Results of Operations 
 Operating Expenses 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of external and internal costs related to the development of lorundrostat. Research and development expenses are recognized as incurred, and payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are capitalized until the goods are received or when the services are performed. 
 Research and development expenses include: 
 salaries, bonuses, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation charges for those individuals involved in research and development efforts; 
 external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations (CROs) and consultants to conduct and support our clinical trials of lorundrostat, and payments made under the Mitsubishi License; and 
 costs related to manufacturing lorundrostat for our clinical trials. 
 We have and plan to continue to substantially increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of lorundrostat. We cannot determine with certainty the timing of initiation, the duration, or the completion costs of current or future clinical trials and preclinical studies of lorundrostat or any future product candidates due to the inherently unpredictable nature of clinical and preclinical development. Clinical and preclinical development timelines, the probability of success, and development costs can differ materially from expectations. In addition, we cannot forecast whether lorundrostat or any future product candidates may be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements will be 
 21 

Table of Contents 

 secured, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements. 
 Our future development costs may vary significantly based on factors such as: 
 the initiation, type, number, scope, progress, expansions, results, costs, and timing of clinical trials and preclinical studies of lorundrostat and any future product candidates we may choose to pursue, including any modifications to clinical development plans based on feedback that we may receive from regulatory authorities; 
 our ability and strategic decision to develop future product candidates other than lorundrostat, and the timing of such development, if any; 
 our ability to receive timely regulatory approvals for lorundrostat, any future product candidates, and additional indications of lorundrostat and any future product candidates, in the jurisdictions in which we or any future partners apply for such approvals; 
 the costs and timing of manufacturing lorundrostat or any future product candidates for use in our trials, including as a result of inflation, any supply chain issues, or component shortages; 
 any additional jurisdictions in which we may seek approval for lorundrostat and any future product candidates and timing of seeking approval in such jurisdictions; 
 the drop-out or discontinuation rates of clinical trial patients; 
 potential additional safety monitoring requested by regulatory agencies; 
 the duration of patient participation in the trials and follow-up; 
 the phase of development of the product candidate; 
 the efficacy and safety profile of the relevant product candidate; and 
 the extent to which we establish strategic collaborations or other arrangements. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, including employee salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation charges, for personnel in executive and administrative functions. Other significant general and administrative expenses include legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters, professional fees for accounting, tax and consulting services, and insurance costs. We expect our general and administrative expenses will increase for the foreseeable future to support our increased research and development activities, manufacturing activities, and the increased costs associated with operating as a public company. These increased costs will likely include increased expenses related to the hiring of additional personnel, audit, legal, regulatory, and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with the exchange listing and the SEC requirements and requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, director and officer insurance costs, and investor and public relations costs. 
 Other Income, Net 
 Interest Income, Net 
 Interest income reported in each period is associated with our investments in money market funds and U.S. treasuries, net of fees, or other related expenses.

 5.1 million in higher compensation expense resulting from additions to headcount, increases in salaries and accrued bonuses, and increased stock-based compensation, and 0.7 million in other research and development expenses, partially offset by a decrease of 4.0 million in license fees. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 6.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to 4.5 million in higher compensation expense resulting from additions to headcount, increases in salaries and accrued bonuses, and increased stock-based compensation, 1.4 million in higher professional fees, and 0.5 million in higher other administrative expenses. 
 Total Other Income, Net 
 Total other income, net increased by 2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily attributable to increased interest earned on our investments in money market funds and U.S. treasuries. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception and anticipate we will continue to incur net losses and have negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of, seek regulatory approval for, and potentially commercialize lorundrostat, seek to identify, assess, acquire, and in-license intellectual property related to or develop additional product candidates and operate as a public company. From inception through the date of this Quarterly Report, we raised aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 498.8 million from the sale of common stock, convertible preferred stock, convertible notes, and pre-funded warrants. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, and investments of 263.6 million. In February 2023, we completed our IPO of 13,800,000 shares of our common stock sold at a price to the public of 16.00 per share, including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase 1,800,000 additional shares of our common stock, for net proceeds of approximately 201.4 million, net of underwriting discounts, commissions, and offering costs. In February 2024, we sold 8,339,169 Shares and, to certain Purchasers, 549,755 Pre-Funded Warrants for aggregate net proceeds of approximately 116.1 million in a Private Placement. 
 Our primary uses of cash to date have been to fund our research and development activities, including with respect to lorundrostat, business planning, establishing and maintaining our intellectual property portfolio, hiring personnel, raising capital, and providing general and administrative support for these operations. 
 Funding Requirements 
 Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to allow us to fund our operations for at least twelve months. However, our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could deplete our capital resources sooner than we expect. Additionally, the process of testing product candidates in clinical trials is costly, and the timing of progress and expenses in these trials is uncertain. 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to: 
 the initiation, type, number, scope, progress, expansions, results, costs, and timing of clinical trials and preclinical studies of lorundrostat and any future product candidates we may choose to pursue, including any modifications to clinical development plans based on feedback that we may receive from regulatory authorities; 
 24 

Table of Contents 

 our ability and strategic decision to develop future product candidates other than lorundrostat, and the timing of such development, if any; 
 our ability to receive timely regulatory approvals for lorundrostat, any future product candidates, and additional indications of lorundrostat and any future product candidates, in the jurisdictions in which we or any future partners apply for such approvals; 
 the costs and timing of manufacturing for lorundrostat, or any future product candidate, including commercial manufacture at sufficient scale, if any product candidate is approved, including as a result of inflation, any supply chain issues, or component shortages; 
 any additional jurisdictions in which we may seek approval for lorundrostat and any future product candidates and timing of seeking approval in such jurisdictions; 
 the costs, timing, and outcome of regulatory meetings and reviews of lorundrostat or any future product candidates; 
 any delays and cost increases that may result from any pandemic or other healthcare emergency; 
 the costs of obtaining, maintaining, enforcing, and protecting our patents and other intellectual property and proprietary rights; 
 our efforts to enhance operational systems and hire additional personnel to satisfy our obligations as a public company, including enhanced internal control over financial reporting; 
 the costs associated with hiring additional personnel and consultants as our business grows, including additional executive officers and clinical development, regulatory, manufacturing, quality, and commercial personnel; 
 the timing and amount of the milestone, royalty, or other payments we must make to Mitsubishi Tanabe, from whom we have in-licensed lorundrostat, or any future licensors; 
 the costs and timing of establishing or securing sales and marketing capabilities if lorundrostat or any future product candidate is approved; 
 our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, coverage, and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, and adequate market share and revenue for any approved products; 
 patients willingness to pay out-of-pocket for any approved products in the absence of coverage and/or adequate reimbursement from third-party payors; 
 the terms and timing of establishing and maintaining collaborations, licenses, and other similar arrangements; 
 costs associated with any products or technologies that we may in-license or acquire; and 
 the other risks and uncertainties described under the heading Risk Factor s in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in Forward-Looking Statements and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 
 Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through equity offerings, debt financings, or other capital sources, including potential collaborations, licenses, and other similar arrangements. We do not have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing and equity financing, if available, 
 25 

Table of Contents 

 may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. Our ability to raise additional funds may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from factors that include but are not limited to, inflation, elevated interest rates, geopolitical conflict in and around Ukraine, Israel, and other areas of the world, diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, and uncertainty about economic stability. If the equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult, more costly, and more dilutive. If we raise additional funds through future collaborations, licenses, or other similar arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our future revenue streams, product candidates, research programs, intellectual property or proprietary technology, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us and/or may reduce the value of our common stock. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed or on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market our product candidates even if we would otherwise prefer to develop and market such product candidates ourselves, or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose. 
 Cash Flows 
 Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Since our inception, we have primarily used our available cash to fund expenditures related to the in-license and development of lorundrostat. The following table sets forth a summary of cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change 
 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities (99,471) (52,192) (47,279) Investing activities 31,389 (152,383) 183,772 Financing activities 116,052 203,174 (87,122) Net 47,970 (1,401) 49,371 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 99.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 52.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily attributable to an increase in cash used to support our operating activities, including but not limited to, the development of lorundrostat and related clinical trial expenses, personnel and compensation expense, legal and professional fees to support our operations, and general working capital requirements. The 47.3 million increase in cash used consisted of an increase in net loss, adjusted for non-cash expenses, of approximately 79.9 million, and the net effect of changes in working capital of 32.7 million. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash provided by investing activities was 31.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash used of 152.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to the timing and amount of purchases and maturities of marketable securities in each period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase in maturities of prior purchases of 218.5 million occurred, which was partially offset by an increase in purchases of 34.6 million.

 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities of 116.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased, compared to 203.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received net proceeds of 116.1 million from the sale of Shares and Pre-Funded Warrants in the Private Placement, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received aggregate net proceeds of 203.0 million from the sale of our common stock in our IPO in February 2023. 
 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 Under the Mitsubishi License, we have milestone payment obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of specified levels of product sales and are required to make certain royalty payments in connection with the sale of products developed under the agreement. We are currently unable to estimate the timing or likelihood of achieving other future milestones or making future product sales. See above and Note 4. Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for additional information regarding the Mitsubishi License. 
 We enter into contracts in the normal course of business for contract research services, contract manufacturing services, professional services, and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination after a notice period, and, therefore, are cancelable contracts. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 We have prepared the condensed financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these condensed financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses, and related disclosures at the date of the condensed financial statements, and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its critical estimates, including those related to prepaid and accrued research and development expenses and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on our historical experience and on assumptions that we believe are reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 There were no changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to our critical accounting estimates as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. For information on our significant accounting policies, please refer to Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 JOBS Act and Smaller Reporting Company Status 
 As an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended (the JOBS Act), we can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and as a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We intend to rely on other exemptions provided by the JOBS Act, including without limitation, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the consummation of our IPO, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion, (iii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur

Table of Contents 

 if, among other factors, the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded 700.0 million as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of such year (subject to certain conditions), or (iv) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. 
 We are also a smaller reporting company as defined in the Exchange Act. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company even after we are no longer an emerging growth company. We may take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies and will be able to take advantage of these scaled disclosures for so long as our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter, or our annual revenue is less than 100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter. 
 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 We have reviewed all recently issued accounting pronouncements and have determined that, other than as disclosed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, such standards do not have a material impact on our condensed financial statements or do not otherwise apply to our operations. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates of our investment portfolio of cash equivalents and investments. As of September 30, 2024, our cash equivalents and investments consisted of money market funds and U.S. treasury securities. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. The fair value of our short-term cash equivalents and investments is subject to change as a result of potential changes in market interest rates. Due to the nature of our cash equivalents and investments, we believe an immediate hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not have had a material effect on our results of operations during the periods presented. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 We are exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We contract with vendors that are located outside the United States and certain invoices are denominated in foreign currencies. We are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates in connection with these arrangements. To date, these fluctuations have not been significant, and we have not had a formal hedging program with respect to foreign currency. We believe an immediate hypothetical 10 change in exchange rates would not have had a material effect on our results of operations during the periods presented. 
 Effects of Inflation 
 Inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and research and development contract costs. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, we may experience some effect in the future due to an impact on the costs to conduct clinical trials, labor costs we incur to attract and retain qualified personnel, and other operational costs. Inflationary costs could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic and current reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. In addition, the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and were operating at a reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Management has determined that there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Part II - Other Information 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are not currently a party to any material proceedings. From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us due to defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, reputational harm, and other factors. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Our business, financial condition, and operating results may be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 under the heading Risk Factors. Any one or more of such factors could directly or indirectly cause our actual results of operations and financial condition to vary materially from past or anticipated future results of operations and financial condition. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, alone or combined with any of the other factors, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and stock price. There have been no material changes to our risk factors since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 None. 
 
 Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 
 Not Applicable. 
 
 Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 
 Not Applicable. 
 
 Item 5. Other Information 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) or any contract, instruction, or written plan for the purchase or sale of our securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Exchange Act or any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as defined in the SEC s rules).
