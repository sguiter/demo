Non-recurring Fair Value Measurements Loans Held for Sale Loans are classified as held for sale if there is an intent to sell them in the short-term following the reporting date. These loans are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value, less selling costs, unless the fair value option was elected at the time of origination. If the loan's fair value, less selling costs, is determined to be less than its amortized cost, a nonrecurring fair value adjustment may be recorded through a valuation allowance. The fair value of loans held for sale may be estimated using sales of comparable loans as supported by independent market data, or a contractually negotiated sales price. We consider the inputs used to calculate the fair value of loans held for sale as unobservable inputs. Accordingly, we classify the fair value of loans held for sale within Level III of the fair value hierarchy. In April 2024, we sold a commercial mortgage loan collateralized by a hotel property located in Honolulu, HI. The loan was previously classified as held for sale during the first quarter of 2024, and sold at a price of during the second quarter of 2024. We recorded a realized loss of million within realized loss on investments on our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . There were loans classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2024. Real Estate Owned Property acquired through foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned and recognized at fair value on our condensed consolidated balance sheet upon acquisition in accordance with ASC Topic 805, "Business Combinations" ("ASC 805"). We are required to record real estate owned, a nonfinancial asset, at fair value on a non-recurring basis in accordance with ASC 820. Under ASC 820, we may utilize the income, market or cost approach (or combination thereof) to determine the fair value of real estate owned. We deem the inputs used in these approaches to be significant unobservable inputs. Therefore, we classify the fair value of real estate owned within Level III of the fair value hierarchy. On March 31, 2023, we acquired legal title of a hotel property in Atlanta, GA ("Atlanta Hotel") through a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. At the time of acquisition, we determined the fair value of the net real estate assets to be million, using a combination of market and income approaches. We utilized a discount rate and capitalization rate of and , respectively. During the three months ended June 30, 2023, the Atlanta Hotel's assets and liabilities were reclassified to held for sale and the fair value of the net real estate assets, less costs to sell, was in excess of our cost basis. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we determined that the sale to a third party from whom we received an unsolicited offer was no longer probable, and we are not actively marketing the property for sale. Therefore, as of March 31, 2024, the Atlanta Hotel no longer met the criteria for held for sale and was reclassified to real estate owned, held for investment. impairments had been recorded as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. On August 3, 2022, we acquired legal title of a multifamily development property located in downtown Brooklyn, NY ("Brooklyn Development") through a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. We determined the fair value of the real estate assumed to be million, based on the market value of the land at the time of acquisition. impairments had been recorded as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.

(1) Loans evaluated for Specific CECL Allowance are excluded from General CECL Allowance pool. 

 (2) During the three months ended March 31, 2024, our General CECL Allowance increased by million. The increase was primarily related to extending our expected loan repayment dates as well as an increase to the historical loss rate derived from Trepp's data. The increase was partially offset by the favorable impacts of portfolio seasoning. Additionally, during the three months ended March 31, 2024, we recorded an increase of million to our Specific CECL Allowance. The increase was related to a mezzanine loan secured by the ultra-luxury residential property. Refer to discussion below. 

 (3) During the three months ended June 30, 2024, our General CECL Allowance increased by million primarily due to new loan originations as well as a more adverse outlook on our office portfolio. The increase was partially offset by the favorable impacts of portfolio seasoning. Additionally, during the three months ended June 30, 2024, we recorded an increase of million to our Specific CECL Allowance. The increase was related to a mezzanine loan secured by an office building in Troy, MI. Refer to discussion below. 

 (4) During the three months ended September 30, 2024, our General CECL Allowance decreased by million primarily due to the favorable impacts of portfolio seasoning and earlier than expected loan repayments. The decrease was partially offset by the effects of loan originations and a more adverse macroeconomic outlook associated with our office portfolio. 

 (5) During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an increase and write-off of million of our Specific CECL Allowance related to our Massachusetts Healthcare Loan (as defined and discussed below). The million write-off was recorded as a realized loss within net realized loss on investments in our September 30, 2024 condensed consolidated statement of operations.

(1) Loans evaluated for Specific CECL Allowance are excluded from General CECL Allowance pool. 

 (2) During the three months ended March 31, 2023, our General CECL Allowance increased by million primarily due to an increase in our view of the remaining expected term of our loan portfolio. This increase was partially offset by the impact of portfolio seasoning and loan repayments and sales. 

 (3) During the three months ended June 30, 2023, our General CECL Allowance increased by million primarily due to a more adverse macroeconomic outlook and an increase in our view of the remaining expected term of certain of our loans. This increase was partially offset by the impact of portfolio seasoning. Additionally, during the three months ended June 30, 2023, we recorded an increase of million to our Specific CECL Allowance. The increase was related to two mezzanine loans secured by the same ultra-luxury property. Refer to discussion below. 

 (4) As of June 30, 2023, million related to the most junior mezzanine loan secured by the ultra-luxury residential property was deemed unrecoverable. Accordingly, million of previously recorded Specific CECL was written-off and recorded as a realized loss within net realized loss on investments in our June 30, 2023 condensed consolidated statement of operations. Refer to "Specific CECL Allowance" section below for further detail. 

 (5) During the three months ended September 30, 2023, our General CECL Allowance decreased by million, primarily due to loan prepayments and portfolio seasoning. 

General CECL Allowance In determining the General CECL Allowance using the WARM method, an annual historical loss rate, adjusted for macroeconomic estimates, is applied to the amortized cost of an asset, or pool of assets, over each subsequent period for the assets' remaining expected life. We considered various factors including (i) historical loss experience in the commercial real estate lending market, (ii) timing of expected repayments and satisfactions, (iii) expected future funding, (iv) capital subordinate to us when we are the senior lender, (v) capital senior to us when we are the subordinate lender, and (vi) our current and future view of the macroeconomic environment for a reasonable and supportable forecast period. The CECL Standard requires the use of significant judgment to arrive at an estimated credit loss. There is significant uncertainty related to future macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, labor shortages and interest rates. We derive an annual historical loss rate based on a commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS") database with historical losses from 1998 through the third quarter of 2024 provided by a third party, Trepp LLC ("Trepp"). We apply various filters to arrive at a CMBS dataset most analogous to our current portfolio from which to determine an appropriate historical loss rate. The annual historical loss rate is further adjusted to reflect our expectations of the macroeconomic environment for a reasonable and supportable forecast period of eight quarters. In assessing the macroeconomic environment, we consider macroeconomic factors, including unemployment rate, commercial real estate prices, and market liquidity. We compare the historical data for each metric to historical commercial real estate losses in order to determine the correlation of the data. We use projections, obtained from third-party service providers, of each factor to approximate the impact the macroeconomic outlook may have on our loss rate. The General CECL Allowance on subordinate loans is calculated by incorporating both the loan balance of the position(s) of the structurally senior third-party lender(s) and the balance of our subordinate loan(s). The subordinate loans, by virtue of being the first loss position, are required to absorb losses prior to the senior position(s) being impacted, resulting in a higher percentage allowance attributable to the subordinate loan. The General CECL Allowance on unfunded loan commitments is time-weighted based on our expected commitment to fund such obligations. The General CECL Allowance on unfunded commitments is recorded as a liability on our condensed consolidated balance sheets within accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities.

million and million , respectively, and included within other assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Although our secured debt obligations and senior secured term loan financing have a minimum tangible net worth maintenance covenant, the General CECL Allowance has no impact on these covenants as we are permitted to add back the General CECL Allowance for the computation of tangible net worth as defined in the respective agreements.

Specific CECL Allowance For collateral-dependent loans where we have deemed the borrower/sponsor to be experiencing financial difficulty and a more than moderate/average risk of realizing a principal loss, we have elected to apply a practical expedient in accordance with the CECL Standard in which the fair value of the underlying collateral is compared to the amortized cost of the loan in determining a Specific CECL Allowance. The Specific CECL Allowance is determined as the difference between the fair value of the underlying collateral and the carrying value of the loan (prior to the Specific CECL Allowance). When the repayment or satisfaction of a loan is dependent on a sale, rather than operations, of the collateral, the fair value is adjusted for the estimated cost to sell the collateral. Collateral-dependent loans evaluated for a Specific CECL Allowance are removed from the General CECL Allowance pool. The fair value of the underlying collateral is determined by using method(s) such as discounted cash flow, the market approach, or direct capitalization approach. The key unobservable inputs used to determine the fair value of the underlying collateral may vary depending on the information available to us and market conditions as of the valuation date. We regularly evaluate the extent and impact of any credit migration associated with the performance and/or value of the underlying collateral property as well as the financial and operating capability of the borrower/sponsor on a loan-by-loan basis. The Specific CECL Allowance is evaluated on a quarterly basis. Specifically, a property's operating results and any cash reserves are analyzed and used to assess (i) whether cash from operations is sufficient to cover the debt service requirements currently and into the future, (ii) the ability of the borrower to refinance the loan and/or (iii) the liquidation value of the underlying collateral. We also evaluate the financial wherewithal of any loan guarantors as well as the borrower's competency in managing and operating the properties. In addition, we consider the overall economic environment, real estate sector and geographic sub-market in which the borrower operates. Such impairment analysis is completed and reviewed by asset management and finance personnel who utilize various data sources, including (i) periodic financial data such as debt service coverage ratio, property occupancy, tenant profile, rental rates, operating expenses, the borrower's exit plan, and capitalization and discount rates, (ii) site inspections and (iii) current credit spreads and discussions with market participants.

 (2) In September 2018, we entered a joint venture with Turner Consulting II, LLC ("Turner Consulting"), through an entity which owns the underlying property that secures our loan. Turner Consulting contributed of the venture's equity and we contributed . The entity was deemed to be a variable interest entity ("VIE"), and we determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of that VIE as we do not have the power to direct the entity's activities. During the second quarter of 2024, the loan's maturity was extended from September 2024 to September 2025.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we recorded a net increase in our Specific CECL Allowance of million. This net increase was comprised of a Specific CECL Allowance and write-off on a commercial mortgage loan and Specific CECL Allowances on two of our subordinate loans. Massachusetts Healthcare In March 2022, we and other Apollo-managed entities co-originated a loan-to-cost first mortgage loan ("Massachusetts Healthcare Loan") secured by eight hospitals in Massachusetts. Our pro-rata interest in the commercial mortgage loan represente d of the o riginal whole loan amount. The loan was made in connection with the capitalization of a joint venture between two parties and eight property owner subsidiaries of the joint venture (the "Borrowers") to own the hospitals which were leased to Steward Health Care ("Steward"), who served as operator. We and other Apollo-managed entities ("Apollo Co-Lenders") did not lend to Steward and do not have any involvement in Steward's operation of the hospitals or performance under the lease. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we ceased accruing interest on our loan and debt service payments received in July through September 2024 reduced the carrying value of our loan. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a million Specific CECL Allowance which was written-off on resolution of our loan during the same period. On September 4, 2024, we and Apollo Co-Lenders, through a joint venture, acquired title to one of the eight hospitals that previously secured our loan. On September 26, 2024, the hospital was taken by eminent domain by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the "Commonwealth"). In conjunction with this taking, we recorded a realized loss representing the difference between our allocation of the amount to be paid by the Commonwealth for the taking and our allocation of the loan related to the underlying property. We and Apollo Co-Lenders have challenged the Commonwealth's taking of the hospital by eminent domain in Massachusetts court. If our challenge is not successful, we and Apollo Co-Lenders intend to further challenge the valuation of the hospital from which the amount to be paid by the Commonwealth was determined. If successful, we and Apollo Co-Lenders may receive additional recovery of our realized losses. The amount to be paid by the Commonwealth is million million attributable to ARI) , while the 2024 tax assessed value of the hospital was million . On September 30, 2024, the guarantors made a guaranty payment on the loan and Borrowers transferred the deeds of the remaining seven hospitals into escrow, thereby releasing the Borrowers from their obligation under the loan agreement. Accordingly, we wrote-off the remaining Specific CECL Allowance and recorded a realized loss representing the difference between our loan' s remaining amortized cost basis and our allocation of the fair value of the seven remaining hospitals, less costs to sell, per the executed purchase and sale agreements and appraised values, where applicable, of the properties underlying the deeds in escrow. In aggregate, we recorded a million realized loss within net realized loss on investments in our September 30, 2024 condensed consolidated statement of operations, and all Specific CECL Allowances related to our loan were written off.

million in other assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheet consisting of an equity method interest in the joint venture with other Apollo-managed entities and an interest in the property deeds in escrow. We did not hold title to the underlying properties as of September 30, 2024. Subsequently, on October 1, 2024, five of the seven hospitals were sold to third parties, and the proceeds were allocated among us and other Apollo Co-Lenders based on our pro-rata interests in the commercial mortgage loan. Refer to "Note 21 Subsequent Events". Michigan Office During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we recorded a Specific CECL Allowance of million on a subordinate loan secured by our interest in a Class A office building in Troy, MI, which was attributable to low occupancy and limited leasing activity in the property's submarket. The million Specific CECL Allowance represents a full reserve against the loan s amortized cost basis. The loan's risk rating was downgraded from a four to a five and the loan was moved to non-accrual status as of June 30, 2024. As discussed further below, we recorded an additional million Specific CECL Allowance on our Junior Mezzanine A Loan (as defined below), during the three months ended March 31, 2024. Loan Modifications Pursuant to ASC 326 During the twelve months ended September 30, 2024, we provided the following loan modifications that require disclosure pursuant to ASC 326. Cleveland Multifamily In May 2021, we originated a first mortgage loan secured by a multifamily property in Cleveland, OH. In April 2024, we modified our loan to convert from a floating rate of Secured Overnight Financing Rate (" SOFR ") + to a fixed rate, and to provide a term extension. These modified terms are included in the determination of our general CECL reserve for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The loan is performing pursuant to its modified contractual terms and its risk rating remains a three as of September 30, 2024. Manhattan Office In March 2022, we originated a first mortgage loan secured by an office property in Manhattan, NY. In April 2024, we modified our loan to convert from a floating rate of SOFR + to a fixed rate. This modified term is included in the determination of our general CECL reserve for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The loan is performing pursuant to its modified contractual terms and its risk rating remains a three as of September 30, 2024. Manhattan Residential In August 2022, we refinanced three of our mezzanine loans (a senior mezzanine loan ("Senior Mezzanine Loan") and two junior mezzanine loans ("Junior Mezzanine A Loan" and "Junior Mezzanine B Loan" collectively referred to as "Junior Mezzanine Loan")), and originated a commercial mortgage loan ("Senior Loan") as part of an overall recapitalization. All of the loans are secured by an ultra-luxury residential property in Manhattan, NY. In refinancing the Senior Mezzanine Loan and Junior Mezzanine Loan, we modified the loan terms with the borrower to include an interest rate reduction and two year extension of the term on all three loans. Based on our analysis under ASC Topic 310-20 "Receivables Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs" ("ASC 310-20"), we have deemed this refinance to be a continuation of our existing loans. During 2022, sales velocity on the underlying property lagged behind the borrower's business plan and management's expectations. Based on this information and broader uncertainty across the ultra-luxury residential property market, we recorded a total loan Specific CECL Allowance of million on the Junior Mezzanine B Loan and downgraded its risk rating to a five.

million Junior Mezzanine B Loan to be unrecoverable and therefore wrote off our mezzanine loan and recorded a realized loss of million within net realized loss on investments in our condensed consolidated statement of operations. We also recorded a million Specific CECL Allowance on the Junior Mezzanine A Loan and downgraded its risk rating to a five. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we recorded an additional million Specific CECL Allowance on our Junior Mezzanine A Loan. The additional Specific CECL Allowance was primarily attributable to a reduction in list pricing of remaining units and slower sales pace at the property. The slower sales velocity coincided with the continued overall softening in the midtown Manhattan ultra-luxury submarket. Any future change to the Specific CECL Allowance will be based upon a number of factors, including but not limited to the continued assessment of both the potential nominal value of remaining inventory as well as the expected sales velocity. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, our Senior Loan was refinanced by a third party lender, which resulted in a repayment of million. The remaining Senior Loan balance was restructured into a subordinate loan ("Senior Mezzanine A Loan"), and extended by fourteen months to November 2025. Concurrently, the maturities of the Senior Mezzanine Loan and the Junior Mezzanine A Loan were extended to November 2025. All three loans remain on non-accrual status subsequent to the refinancing. Based on our analysis under ASC 310-20, we have deemed this refinance to be a continuation of our existing loans. The modified loan terms as discussed above have been reflected in our calculation of CECL for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Refer to the "CECL" section above for additional information regarding our calculation of CECL Allowances. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate amortized cost basis, net of Specific CECL Allowance, of these modified receivables was million and million , respectively, or and of our aggregate commercial mortgage loans and subordinate loans by amortized cost, respectively. There were unfunded commitments related to these loans of million as of September 30, 2024 and as of December 31, 2023. Other Loan Activity We cease accruing interest on loans if we deem the interest to be uncollectible with any previously accrued uncollected interest on the loan charged to interest income in the same period. The amortized cost basis, net of Specific CECL Allowance, for loans on non-accrual was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Under certain circumstances, we may apply the cost recovery method under which interest collected on a loan reduces the loan's amortized cost. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received million and million , respectively, in interest that reduced amortized cost under the cost recovery method compared to million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in interest recorded under the cost recovery method during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is related to our Massachusetts Healthcare Loan discussed above. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amortized cost basis, net of Specific CECL Allowance, for loans with accrued interest past due 90 or more days was million and million , respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no loans with accrued interest between 30 and 89 days past due. We recognized million and million of pre-payment penalties and accelerated fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded million and million , respectively, of interest income related to a subordinate risk retention interest in a securitization vehicle. The subordinate risk retention interest was repaid in full during the third quarter of 2023. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we received million million assuming conversion into U.S. Dollars ("USD")) full repayment of one of our commercial mortgage loans secured by an office property in London, UK, 

 20 

million. In conjunction with the repayment, the related participation interest sold was also fully satisfied. Refer to "Note 12 Participations Sold" for additional detail. Loan Sales From time to time, we may enter into sale transactions with other parties. All sale transactions are evaluated in accordance with ASC Topic 860, "Transfers and Servicing" ("ASC 860"). In April 2024, we sold a commercial mortgage loan collateralized by a hotel property located in Honolulu, HI. The loan was previously classified as held for sale during the first quarter of 2024, and sold at a price of during the second quarter of 2024. Upon selling the commercial mortgage loan, we reversed the previously recorded valuation allowance and recorded a realized loss of million included within realized loss on investments on our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the first quarter of 2023, we sold our entire interests in commercial mortgage loans secured by various properties in Europe, with aggregate commitments of million million assuming conversion into USD, of which million or million assuming conversion into USD, was funded at the time of sale). Additionally, we sold a partial interest of million million assuming conversion into USD) in a commercial mortgage loan secured by a mixed-use property located in London, United Kingdom. These sales were made to entities managed by affiliates of the Manager. We evaluated the transaction under ASC 860 and determined the sale of our entire interests and the sale of the partial interest met the criteria for sale accounting. In connection with these sales, we recorded a net gain of approximately million within net realized loss on investments on our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . 

 properties: the D.C. Hotel, a full-service luxury hotel in Washington, D.C., the Brooklyn Development, a multifamily development property located in downtown Brooklyn, NY, and the Atlanta Hotel, a hotel in Atlanta, GA. D.C. Hotel On May 24, 2021, we acquired legal title to the D.C. hotel, which previously secured two subordinate loans, through a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. In accordance with ASC 805, we consolidated the hotel's assets and liabilities at their respective fair values. Refer to "Note 3 Fair Value Disclosure" for full discussion of non-recurring fair value measurements. As of March 1, 2022, the hotel assets, comprised of land, building, furniture, fixtures, and equipment ("FF E"), and accumulated depreciation (collectively "REO Fixed Assets"), and liabilities met the criteria to be classified as held for sale under ASC Topic 360, "Property, Plant, and Equipment" ("ASC 360"). Accordingly, as of March 1, 2022, we ceased recording depreciation on the building and FF E on the condensed consolidated statement of operations. As of March 1, 2023, due to market conditions, we curtailed active marketing efforts, and reclassified the REO Fixed Assets and liabilities from real estate owned, held for sale to real estate owned, held for investment, net. In accordance with ASC 360, the REO Fixed Assets were reclassified to their carrying value before they were initially classified as held for sale in March of 2022, and all other assets and liabilities were reclassified to the corresponding line items on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Upon reclassification, we recorded million of depreciation expense, representing the amount that would have been recorded had the asset remained as held for investment, and included this amount within Depreciation and amortization on real estate owned on our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2023. No realized gain or loss was recorded in connection with this reclassification. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the value of net real estate assets related to the D.C. Hotel was million and million , respectively. As of September 30, 2024, our net real estate assets included depreciable assets of million , net of million in accumulated depreciation, attributable to the building, and million , net of million in 

 21 

million , net of million in accumulated depreciation, attributable to the building, and million , net of million in accumulated depreciation, attributable to FF E. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we obtained a million mortgage secured by the D.C. Hotel. The mortgage includes an interest rate of term one-month SOFR + and current maturity of July 2026, with an option to extend for , contingent upon meeting certain conditions. The mortgage agreement contains covenants requiring our unencumbered liquidity be greater than million and our net worth be greater than million. Under these covenants, our General CECL Allowance is added back to our net worth calculation. The carrying value of the mortgage included within debt related to real estate owned, held for investment, net on our condensed consolidated balance sheet was million , net of million in deferred financing costs. To manage our exposure to variable cash flows on our borrowings under this mortgage, we entered into an interest rate cap on June 13, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the interest rate cap was de minimis. Refer to "Note 11 Derivatives" for full detail. We recorded net profit from hotel operations of million and million for three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and net profit of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Brooklyn Development In 2015, we originated a million multifamily development commercial mortgage loan secured by an assemblage of properties in downtown Brooklyn, NY. In 2020, the loan went into default, and we recorded a million Specific CECL Allowance, due to the deterioration of market conditions attributable to COVID-19. As a result of improved market conditions, we reversed million of Specific CECL Allowance during the second quarter of 2021. In the second quarter of 2022, we reversed the remaining million Specific CECL Allowance as a result of market rent growth and value created from development activities at the underlying property. On August 3, 2022, we acquired legal title of the property through a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure and accounted for the asset acquisition in accordance with ASC 805. At that time, our amortized cost basis in the commercial mortgage loan was million. We recorded the real estate assumed at a fair value of million based on the market value of the property as of the date of acquisition. We recognized a realized gain of million, recorded within realized gain (loss) on investments on our condensed consolidated statement of operations, which reflects the difference between the fair value of the property and the carrying value of the loan at the time of acquisition. The non-recurring fair value measurement was classified as Level III within the fair value hierarchy due to the use of significant unobser vable inputs, including comparable sales of similar properties in the market. We capitalized construction and financing costs of million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our cost basis in the property was million and million , respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our cost basis included construction costs of million and million , respectively. There is no depreciation recorded while the property is under development. Upon taking title, we concurrently contributed the property to a joint venture with a third-party real estate developer. The entity was deemed to be a VIE, of which we were determined to be the primary beneficiary. Through our wholly owned subsidiaries, we hold a equity ownership interest in the joint venture and our partner is only entitled to profit upon achievement of certain returns under our joint venture agreement. Concurrently with taking title to the property, we obtained million in construction financing on the property. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of the construction financing included within debt related to real estate owned, held for investment, net on our condensed consolidated balance sheets was million , net of million in deferred financing costs and million , net of million in deferred financing costs, respectively. The construction financing includes a maximum commitment of million, an interest rate of SOFR + , and current maturity of August 2026, with an option to extend for , contingent upon meeting certain conditions. The construction financing agreement contains covenants requiring our unencumbered liquidity be greater than million and 

 22 

million. Under these covenants, our General CECL Allowance is added back to our net worth calculation. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with these covenants. To manage our exposure to variable cash flows on our borrowings under this construction financing, we entered into an interest rate cap on September 26, 2023, and extended on September 30, 2024 for an additional year. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the interest rate cap was million and million , respectively, and recorded within derivative assets, net on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. Refer to "Note 11 Derivatives" for full detail. Atlanta Hotel In March 2017, we originated a first mortgage loan secured by the Atlanta Hotel. During the second quarter of 2022, due to slower than expected recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, we deemed the borrower to be experiencing financial difficulty. Accordingly, we ceased accruing interest on the loan and recorded a million Specific CECL Allowance. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we wrote off the million previously recorded Specific CECL Allowance and reduced the principal balance of the loan which was recorded as a realized loss within net realized loss on investments in our December 31, 2022 consolidated statement of operations. On March 31, 2023, we acquired legal title of the Atlanta Hotel through a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure and determined the fair value of net real estate assets to be million in accordance with ASC 820. The fair value of the real estate owned is categorized within Level III of the fair value hierarchy set forth by ASC 820 and includes the use of significant unobservable inputs. See "Note 3 Fair Value Disclosure" for discussion of our non-recurring fair value measurements. Additionally, we recognized a realized loss of million, recorded within net realized loss on investments on our condensed consolidated statement of operations. The realized loss represents the difference between the original loan's amortized cost and the fair value of the net assets acquired. During the three months ended June 30, 2023, we received an unsolicited offer from a third party to purchase the Atlanta Hotel. As of June 30, 2023, the hotel's assets and liabilities met the criteria to be classified as held for sale under ASC 360. In accordance with ASC 360, we ceased recording depreciation on the building and FF E on the condensed consolidated statement of operations and we have reclassified assets and liabilities from their respective condensed consolidated balance sheet line items to Assets related to real estate owned, held for sale and Liabilities related to real estate owned, held for sale. As of March 31, 2024, we determined the sale of the Atlanta Hotel to a third party, from whom we received an unsolicited offer, to be no longer probable, and we are not actively marketing the property for sale to other potential buyers. As such, the Atlanta Hotel no longer met the criteria to be classified as held for sale under ASC 360. In accordance with ASC 360, the REO Fixed Assets were reclassified to their carrying value before classifying as held for sale in June of 2023. On the date of reclassification, March 31, 2024, we recorded million in depreciation, representing the amount that would have been recorded had the asset remained as held for investment. All other assets and liabilities were reclassified to the corresponding line items on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. No realized gain or loss was recorded in connection with this reclassification. As of September 30, 2024, the value of net real estate assets related to the Atlanta Hotel was million . As of September 30, 2024, our net real estate assets included depreciable assets of million , net of million in accumulated depreciation, attributable to the building, and million , net of million in accumulated depreciation, attributable to FF E. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded net profit/(loss) from the hotel's operations of million and million , respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded million and million of net income from the hotel's operations, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the hotel's assets and liabilities were classified as held for sale, and the value of net real estate assets related to the Atlanta Hotel was million . As of December 31, 2023, our net real estate assets included depreciable assets of million , net of million in accumulated depreciation, attributable to the building, and million , net of million in accumulated depreciation, attributable to FF E.

Atlas Facility On February 8, 2023, in connection with the acquisition by certain subsidiaries of Atlas, which is a wholly-owned investment of a fund managed by an affiliate of the Manager, the Credit Suisse Facility was acquired by Atlas ("Atlas Facility"). For full discussion of this transaction, refer to "Note 15 Related Party Transactions." Revolving Credit Facility On March 3, 2023, we entered into the revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") administered by Bank of America, N.A. The Revolving Credit Facility provides up to million of borrowings secured by qualifying commercial mortgage loans and real property owned assets. As of September 30, 2024, our interest coverage ratio was a minimum of :1. See "Debt Covenants" below for additional discussion. The Revolving Credit Facility has a term of , maturing in March 2026.

Barclays Private Securitization We are party to a private securitization with Barclays Bank plc ("Barclays") (such securitization, the "Barclays Private Securitization"). Commercial mortgage loans currently financed under the Barclays Securitization are denominated in GBP, EUR and SEK. The Barclays Private Securitization does not include daily margining provisions and grants us significant discretion to modify certain terms of the underlying collateral including waiving certain loan-level covenant breaches and deferring or waiving of debt service payments for up to months. The securitization includes loan-to-value based covenants with deleveraging requirements that are based on significant declines in the value of the collateral as determined by an annual third-party (engaged by us) appraisal process tied to the provisions of the underlying loan agreements. We believe this provides us with both cushion and predictability to avoid sudden unexpected outcomes and material repayment requirements.

million of unfunded commitments related to our commercial mortgage and subordinate loans. The timings and amounts of fundings are uncertain as these commitments relate to loans for construction costs, capital expenditures, leasing costs, interest and carry costs, among others. As such, the timings and amounts of future fundings depend on the progress and performance of the underlying assets of our loans. Certain of our lenders are contractually obligated to fund their ratable portion of these loan commitments over time, while other lenders have some degree of discretion over future loan funding obligations. The total unfunded commitment is expected to be funded over the remaining years weighted-average tenor of these loans.

 The forward-looking statements are based on our beliefs, assumptions and expectations of our future performance, taking into account all information currently available to us. Forward-looking statements are not predictions of future events. These beliefs, assumptions and expectations can change as a result of many possible events or factors, not all of which are known to us. See Item 1A. "Risk Factors" and Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. These and other risks, uncertainties and factors, including those described in the annual, quarterly and current reports that we file with the SEC, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those included in any forward-looking statements we make. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. New risks and uncertainties arise over time, and it is not possible to predict those events or how they may affect us.

 Overview 
 We are a Maryland corporation and have elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We primarily originate, acquire, invest in and manage performing commercial first mortgage loans, subordinate financings, and other commercial real estate-related debt investments. These asset classes are referred to as our target assets. 
 We are externally managed and advised by the Manager, an indirect subsidiary of Apollo, a global, high-growth alternative asset manager with assets under management of approximately 696.3 billion as of June 30, 2024. 
 40 

The Manager is led by an experienced team of senior real estate professionals who have significant expertise in underwriting and structuring commercial real estate financing transactions. We benefit from Apollo's global infrastructure and operating platform, through which we are able to source, evaluate and manage potential investments in our target assets. 
 In March 2024, the SEC adopted amendments to its rules under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act that require disclosure of certain climate-related information in registration statements and annual reports, when material. In April 2024, the SEC chose to stay its newly adopted climate disclosure rules, pending the completion of judicial review. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new rule, if the stay is lifted, on our disclosures. 
 Current Market Conditions 
 Certain external events such as public health issues, natural disasters, political and economic instability abroad, concerns regarding the stability of the sovereign debt of certain European countries, and other geopolitical issues, including the ongoing conflicts between Israel and Hamas, as well as further escalation of tensions between Israel and various countries in the Middle East and North Africa, and among Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, and the severe economic sanctions and export controls imposed by the U.S. and other governments against Russia, Belarus and Russian or Belarusian interests, have adversely impacted the global economy and have contributed to significant volatility in financial markets. Due to various uncertainties caused by such external events and recent macroeconomic trends, including inflation and higher interest rates, further business risks could arise. Some of the factors that impacted us to date and may continue to affect us are outlined in Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income decreased by 4.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to placing our Massachusetts Healthcare Loan on non-accrual status as of July 1, 2024. Refer to "Note 4 Commercial Mortgage Loans, Subordinate Loans and Other Lending Assets, Net" for additional detail. 
 Operations Related to Real Estate Owned 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded net income related to real estate owned of 2.3 million, compared to net income of 5.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease in net income was primarily due to the seasonality of the D.C. Hotel's operations which led to 3.2 million lower net income from operations, prior to depreciation, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. Refer to "Note 5 Real Estate Owned" for full discussion of the reclassification and operations related to real estate owned. 
 42 

Operating Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses and management fees to related party remained generally the same for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 Other income, net 
 Other income, net increased by 0.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. This increase was due to an increase in bank interest earned on our cash balances, money market funds, and cash reserves held by our loan servicer. 
 Reversal of valuation allowance, commercial mortgage loan held for sale and Net realized loss on investment 
 During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we sold one of our commercial mortgage loans collateralized by a hotel property in Honolulu, HI. The loan was classified as held for sale during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and a 0.7 million valuation allowance was recorded to carry the loan at its fair value in the first quarter of 2024. At the time of sale, we reversed the full valuation allowance and recorded a 0.7 million realized loss within realized loss on investments on our condensed consolidated statement of operations. 
 Net realized loss on investment 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a 127.5 million realized loss on the extinguishment of the Massachusetts Healthcare Loan. Refer to "Note 4 Commercial Mortgage Loans, Subordinate Loans and Other Lending Assets, Net" for full discussion. 
 Increase in Specific CECL Allowance, net 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there was no net change to our Specific CECL Allowance. We recorded an increase and subsequent write-off of 127.5 million of our Specific CECL Allowance related to the Massachusetts Healthcare Loan. The 127.5 million write-off was recorded as a realized loss within net realized loss on investments on our September 30, 2024 condensed consolidated statement of operations. 
 Comparatively, during the three months ended June 30, 2024, we recorded a 7.5 million Specific CECL Allowance on a subordinate loan secured by our interest in a Class A office building in Troy, MI. This allowance was attributable to low occupancy and limited leasing activity in the property's submarket. Refer to "Note 4 Commercial Mortgage Loans, Subordinate Loans and Other Lending Assets, Net" for additional information related to our Specific CECL Allowance and further detail on the mezzanine loan. 
 Decrease in General CECL Allowance, net 
 Our General CECL Allowance decreased by 0.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by the favorable impacts of portfolio seasoning, earlier than expected loan repayments, and transfer of the Massachusetts Healthcare Loan to the loans evaluated for Specific CECL Allowances. The decrease was partially offset by the effects of loan originations and a more adverse macroeconomic outlook on our office portfolio. Comparatively, our General CECL Allowance increased by 2.8 million during the three months ended June 30, 2024, which was primarily driven by new loan originations as well as a more adverse outlook on our office portfolio. The increase was partially offset by the favorable impacts of portfolio seasoning. 
 Refer to "Note 4 Commercial Mortgage Loans, Subordinate Loans and Other Lending Assets, Net" for additional information related in our General CECL Allowance. 
 Foreign currency translation gain and loss on derivative instruments 
 We use forward currency contracts to economically hedge net interest and principal repayments under our loans denominated in currencies other than USD. Foreign currency gains and losses on derivative instruments are evaluated on a combined basis and the net impact for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended June 30, 2024 
 43 

were net gains of 0.6 million and 5.0 million, respectively. The change in net gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024 was predominantly due to higher forward point estimates and losses on forward currency contracts related to our net interest hedges for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, Fx rates increased in relation to USD while Fx rates slightly decreased in relation to USD during the three months ended June 30, 2024. The increase in Fx rates resulted in a loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and a gain related to foreign currency translation. Gains and losses on our forward currency contracts are derived from changes in market spot rates, forward point estimates, and discount factors. Gains and losses related to foreign currency translation are derived only from changes in market spot rates. Forward currency contract gains and losses derived from market spot rates offset the gains and losses related to foreign currency translation except for the gains and losses from forward currency contracts related to our net interest hedges which have no offset in foreign currency translation. A net gain or loss arises each period due to the change in forward point estimates and discount factors as well as gains and losses from forward currency contracts related to our net interest hedges. 
 Gain (loss) on interest rate hedges 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a net loss of 14.0 thousand on our interest rate caps compared to a net gain of 0.1 million recorded during the three months ended June 30, 2024. The net loss was primarily driven by unrealized losses attributable to a decline in fair value of our construction financing interest rate cap as it approached its October 1, 2024 original maturity. These unrealized losses were partially offset by realized gains, attributable to SOFR exceeding the interest rate cap's strike rate. 
 Income tax provision 
 Income tax provision remained generally the same for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. Refer to "Note 5 Real Estate Owned" for additional detail.

Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income decreased by 38.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest income was primarily driven by a decrease in interest income from placing a first mortgage loan and subordinate loan collateralized by the same ultra-luxury residential-for-sale property in Manhattan on non-accrual status as of May 1, 2023 and placing the Massachusetts Healthcare Loan on non-accrual status as of July 1, 2024. Additionally, we modified two of our loans to convert from floating rate loans to fixed rate loans, which resulted in a decrease in net interest income earned during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Refer to "Note 4 Commercial Mortgage Loans, Subordinate Loans and Other Lending Assets, Net" for additional detail. 
 Operations Related to Real Estate Owned 
 Net income related to real estate owned increased by 0.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was a result of greater net income attributable to the D.C. Hotel during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to catch-up depreciation recorded upon reclassification of the asset from held-for-sale to held-for-investment as of March 31, 2023. Additionally, the increase in net income related to real estate owned is a result of taking title to the Atlanta Hotel on March 31, 2023. Given the timing of title acquisition, there was no net income associated with the Atlanta Hotel during the first quarter of 2023. Refer to "Note 5 Real Estate Owned" for full discussion of operations related to real estate owned. 
 Operating Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses remained generally the same for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 45 

Management fees expense decreased by 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in stockholders' equity (as defined in the Management Agreement) as a result of increased Specific CECL Allowance and realized losses on investments recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Other income, net 
 Other income, net decreased by 1.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was due to a decrease in bank interest earned on our cash balances and money market funds, as we deployed capital into loan originations and stock repurchases during 2024. 
 Net realized loss on investments 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a 128.2 million net realized loss on investments, consisting of i) a 0.7 million realized loss related to the sale of a commercial mortgage loan collateralized by a hotel property located in Honolulu, HI, which was previously classified as held for sale and was sold at a price of 99.5 and ii) a 127.5 million realized loss related to the extinguishment of the Massachusetts Healthcare Loan. Refer to "Note 4 Commercial Mortgage Loans, Subordinate Loans and Other Lending Assets, Net" for additional detail. 
 Comparatively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a net realized loss on investments of 86.6 million, consisting of i) a 4.8 million realized loss related to the acquisition of the Atlanta Hotel through a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure and ii) a 82.0 million realized loss on investments representing a write-off of previously recorded Specific CECL Allowance on one of our subordinate loans secured by an ultra-luxury residential property in Manhattan, NY. These losses were partially offset by a 0.2 million gain on investments recorded in connection with the sale of our entire interest in three commercial loans secured by properties in Europe and a partial interest in one commercial loan secured by property located in London, UK. 
 Refer to "Note 4 Commercial Mortgage Loans, Subordinate Loans and Other Lending Assets, Net" and "Note 5 Real Estate Owned" for additional detail. 
 Gain on Extinguishment of Debt 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased 53.9 million aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes. As a result of this transaction, we recognized a 0.5 million gain on extinguishment of debt. We repaid the remaining principal of the 2023 Notes in full during the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 Increase in Specific CECL Allowance, net 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a net increase in our Specific CECL Allowance of 149.5 million, related to two of our subordinate loans. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we recorded a 142.0 million Specific CECL Allowance related to a mezzanine loan secured by an ultra-luxury residential property in Manhattan, NY, primarily attributable to a reduction in list pricing of remaining units and slower sales pace at the property. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we recorded a Specific CECL Allowance of 7.5 million on a subordinate loan secured by our interest in a Class A office building in Troy, MI, attributable to low occupancy and limited leasing activity in the property's submarket. Additionally, we recorded an increase and subsequent write-off of 127.5 million of our Specific CECL Allowance related to the Massachusetts Healthcare Loan. The 127.5 million write-off was recorded as a realized loss within net realized loss on investments in our September 30, 2024 condensed consolidated statement of operations. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a net increase to our Specific CECL Allowance of 59.5 million. We recorded a 141.5 million Specific CECL Allowance related to two mezzanine loans secured by the same ultra-luxury residential property in Manhattan, NY. As of June 30, 2023, 82.0 million related to the most junior mezzanine loan was deemed unrecoverable. Accordingly, 82.0 million of previously recorded Specific CECL was written-off and recorded as a realized loss within net realized loss on investments in our June 30, 2023 condensed consolidated statement of operations. 
 Refer to "Note 4 Commercial Mortgage Loans, Subordinate Loans and Other Lending Assets, Net" for additional detail.

Increase in General CECL Allowance, net 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a net increase in our General CECL Allowance of 7.5 million. The increase was primarily driven by new loan originations as well as a more adverse macroeconomic outlook on our office portfolio. The increase was partially offset by the favorable impacts of portfolio seasoning. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a net increase in our General CECL Allowance of 0.7 million primarily driven by a more adverse macroeconomic outlook, which was partially offset by the effects of portfolio seasoning and loan repayment activity outpacing origination activity. 
 Refer to "Note 4 Commercial Mortgage Loans, Subordinate Loans and Other Lending Assets, Net" for additional detail. 
 Foreign currency translation gain and loss on derivative instruments 
 Foreign currency gains and losses on derivative instruments are evaluated on a combined basis and the net impact for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was a net gain of 9.4 million and 4.3 million, respectively. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the GBP and EUR rates rose in relation to USD while the GBP rate rose and the EUR rate fell during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in Fx rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted in a loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and a gain related to foreign currency translation. The slight overall decrease in Fx rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 resulted in a gain on our foreign currency forward contracts and a loss related to foreign currency translation. The net gain both for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to lower forward point estimates. 
 Gain (loss) on interest rate hedges 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a net gain of 0.4 million on our interest rate hedges or caps. The net gain was primarily driven by a 1.6 million realized gain recorded in relation to our construction financing interest rate cap, which we purchased in September 2023. The realized gain is attributable to SOFR exceeding the interest rate cap's strike rate. Additionally, we recorded a partially offsetting unrealized loss of 1.2 million, driven by a decrease in the interest rate cap's fair value, as it approaches its maturity. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a net loss of 0.1 million on our interest rate cap related to our 2026 Term Loan. Though we recorded a realized gain of 9.1 million driven by an increase in the applicable index rate above the interest rate cap strike rate, this gain was offset by unrealized losses of 9.2 million, resulting from a decrease in the interest rate cap's fair value as it reached its June 2023 maturity. 
 Refer to "Note 11 Derivatives" for full discussion of interest rate caps. 
 Income tax provision 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an income tax provision of 0.3 million. Comparatively, we recorded an income tax provision of 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The income tax provisions recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 reflect our expectations of aggregate projected taxable income of one of our TRS entities for the taxable years ending December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Subsequent Events 
 Refer to "Note 21 Subsequent Events" to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for disclosure regarding significant transactions that occurred subsequent to September 30, 2024.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Distributable Earnings 
 Distributable Earnings is defined as net income available to common stockholders, computed in accordance with GAAP, adjusted for (i) equity-based compensation expense (a portion of which may become cash-based upon final vesting and settlement of awards should the holder elect net share settlement to satisfy income tax withholding), (ii) any unrealized gains or losses or other non-cash items (including depreciation and amortization related to real estate owned) included in net income available to common stockholders, (iii) unrealized income from unconsolidated joint ventures, (iv) foreign currency gains (losses), other than (a) realized gains/(losses) related to interest income, and (b) forward point gains/(losses) realized on our foreign currency hedges, and (v) provision for loan losses. Distributable Earnings may also be adjusted to exclude certain other non-cash items, as determined by the Manager and approved by a majority of our independent directors. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Distributable Earnings were 83.2) million, or (0.59) per share, and 16.6 million, or 0.12 per share, respectively, as compared to 52.7 million, or 0.37 per share, and 106.0 million, or 0.73 per share, respectively, for the same period in the prior year. 
 The weighted-average diluted shares outstanding used for Distributable Earnings per weighted-average diluted share has been adjusted from weighted-average diluted shares under GAAP to exclude shares issued from a potential conversion of the Convertible Notes for 2023. The Convertible Notes were fully repaid during the fourth quarter 2023, and as such, no adjustment is applied in 2024. Consistent with the treatment of other unrealized adjustments to Distributable Earnings, these potentially issuable shares are excluded until a conversion occurs, which we believe is a useful presentation for investors. We believe that excluding shares issued in connection with a potential conversion of the Convertible Notes from our computation of Distributable Earnings per weighted-average diluted share is useful to investors for various reasons, including the following: (i) conversion of Convertible Notes to shares requires both the holder of a note to elect to convert the Convertible Note and for us to elect to settle the conversion in the form of shares; (ii) future conversion decisions by note holders will be based on our stock price in the future, which is presently not determinable; (iii) the exclusion of shares issued in connection with a potential conversion of the Convertible Notes from the computation of Distributable Earnings per weighted-average diluted share is consistent with how we treat other unrealized items in our computation of Distributable Earnings per weighted-average diluted share; and (iv) we believe that when evaluating our operating performance, investors and potential investors consider our Distributable Earnings relative to our actual distributions, which are based on shares outstanding and not shares that might be issued in the future. 
 The table below summarizes the reconciliation from weighted-average diluted shares under GAAP to the weighted-average diluted shares used for Distributable Earnings:

(1) Unvested RSUs are net of incremental shares assumed repurchased under the treasury stock method, if dilutive. There were no incremental shares included in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. For 2023, the weighted-average diluted shares for GAAP were determined using the if-converted method. 

As a REIT, U.S. federal income tax law generally requires us to distribute annually at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and that we pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we annually distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income. Given these requirements and our belief that dividends are generally one of the principal reasons stockholders invest in a REIT, we generally intend over time to pay dividends to our stockholders in an amount equal to our net taxable income, if and to the extent authorized by our board of directors. 
 48 

Distributable Earnings is a key factor considered by the board of directors in setting the dividend and as such we believe Distributable Earnings is useful to investors. 
 We believe it is useful to our investors to present Distributable Earnings prior to net realized loss on investments and realized gain on extinguishment of debt to reflect our operating results because (i) our operating results are primarily comprised of earning interest income on our investments net of borrowing and administrative costs, which comprise our ongoing operations and (ii) it has been a useful factor related to our dividend per share because it is one of the considerations when a dividend is determined. We believe that our investors use Distributable Earnings and Distributable Earnings prior to net realized loss on investments and realized gain on extinguishment of debt, or a comparable supplemental performance measure, to evaluate and compare the performance of our company and our peers. 
 2024 Realized Losses 
 During the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a realized loss on investments of 127.5 million and 128.2 million, respectively. We recorded a 127.5 million realized loss on the extinguishment of our Massachusetts Healthcare Loan during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, in April 2024, we sold a commercial mortgage loan collateralized by a hotel property in Honolulu, HI, at a price of 99.5 , resulting in a realized loss of 0.7 million. These losses comprised the total realized loss on investments of 128.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Refer to "Note 4 Commercial Mortgage Loans, Subordinate Loans and Other Lending Assets, Net" for additional detail. 
 2023 Realized Losses Gain on Extinguishment of Debt 
 During nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a net realized loss on investments of 86.6 million consisting of i) 4.8 million realized loss related to the acquisition of a hotel property through a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, ii) 82.0 million realized loss on investments representing a write-off of previously recorded Specific CECL Allowance on one of our subordinate loans secured by an ultra-luxury residential property in Manhattan, NY, iii) which was partially offset by a 0.2 million net realized gain on loan sales. No realized loss on investments was recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Refer to "Note 4 Commercial Mortgage Loans, Subordinate Loans and Other Lending Assets, Net" for additional detail. 
 During the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded realized gains on extinguishment of debt of 30.0 thousand and 0.5 million, respectively in connection with partial repurchases of our 2023 Notes. See "Note 10 Convertible Senior Notes, Net" for full discussion of these transactions. 
 A significant limitation associated with Distributable Earnings as a measure of our financial performance over any period is that it excludes unrealized gains (losses) from investments. In addition, our presentation of Distributable Earnings may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies, that use different calculations. As a result, Distributable Earnings should not be considered as a substitute for our GAAP net income as a measure of our financial performance or any measure of our liquidity under GAAP. Distributable Earnings are reduced for realized losses on loans which include losses that management believes are near certain to be realized.

We believe that presenting book value per share with sub-totals prior to the CECL Allowances and depreciation and amortization is useful for investors for various reasons, including, among other things, analyzing our compliance with financial covenants related to tangible net worth and debt-to-equity under our secured debt arrangements and senior secured term loan, which permit us to add the General CECL Allowance to our GAAP stockholders' equity. Given that our lenders consider book value per share prior to the General CECL Allowance as an important metric related to our debt covenants, we believe disclosing book value per share prior to the General CECL Allowance is important to investors such that they have the same visibility. We further believe that presenting book value before depreciation and amortization is useful to investors since it is a non-cash expense included in net income and is not representative of our core business and ongoing operations. 
 Investment Guidelines 
 Our current investment guidelines, approved by our board of directors, are comprised of the following: 
 no investment will be made that would cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes; 

no investment will be made that would cause us to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act; 

investments will be predominantly in our target assets; 

no more than 20 of our net equity (on a consolidated basis) will be invested in any single investment at the time of the investment; in determining compliance with the investment guidelines, the amount of the investment is the net equity in the investment (gross investment less amount of third-party financing) plus the amount of any recourse on the financing secured by the investment; and 

until appropriate investments can be identified, the Manager may invest the proceeds of any offering in interest bearing, short-term investments, including money market accounts and/or funds, that are consistent with our intention to qualify as a REIT. 

The board of directors must approve any change in or waiver to these investment guidelines. 
 Investment Activity 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we committed 1.1 billion of capital to new loans 955.3 million was funded at closing), and provided 530.7 million of add-on fundings, including 212.9 million to a first mortgage loan secured by a portfolio of pubs across the United Kingdom, that was originated in December 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received 1.7 billion in loan repayments and sales.

Portfolio Management 
 Our portfolio benefits from our core investment strategy whereby we target assets that are secured by institutional quality real estate throughout the United States and Europe. As discussed in Item 1. "Business Investment Strategy" in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Manager has implemented underwriting standards which place a particular emphasis on due diligence of prospective investments' sponsors and borrowers, as well as assessment of the risk/return profile and appropriate structure of each investment opportunity. As of September 30, 2024, our portfolio's weighted-average origination LTV ratio was 58 , excluding risk-rated five loans. This reflects significant equity value which we believe our loan sponsors would be committed to protect during periods of volatility and market disruption. 
 We maintain a strong relationship with our borrowers and actively manage the assets in our portfolio on an ongoing basis. A dedicated team of asset management professionals performs surveillance of all loans in our portfolio, on an individual basis, from closing through final repayment. This robust monitoring process includes continuous assessment of asset level performance against underwritten criteria, changes in borrowers' financial position, as well as the impact of macroeconomic trends and microeconomic developments on loan assets and respective underlying collateral performance. 
 In addition to ongoing asset management, as further described in "Note 4 Commercial Mortgage Loans, Subordinate Loans and Other Lending Assets, Net" to our condensed consolidated financial statements, we perform a quarterly review of our portfolio whereby each loan is assigned a risk rating of "1" through "5," from less risk to greater risk, respectively. This analysis includes assessment of loans based on a variety of factors, including, without limitation, LTV ratio, debt yield, property type, geographic and local market dynamics, physical condition, cash flow volatility, leasing and tenant profile, loan structure and exit plan, and project sponsorship. In performing the analysis with respect to each loan, these various factors are assessed holistically, with a focus on their interplay, whereby no single factor on its own (whether quantitative or qualitative) is given more weight in the assessment or is prescriptive as to which specific risk rating is assigned to a specific loan. We apply these various factors on a case-by-case basis depending on the facts and circumstances for each loan, and the different factors may be given different weightings in different situations. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted-average risk rating of the loan portfolio was 3.0.

Leverage Policies 
 We use leverage for the sole purpose of financing our portfolio and not for the purpose of speculating on changes in interest rates. In addition to our secured debt arrangements and senior secured term loan, we access additional sources of borrowings. Our charter and bylaws do not limit the amount of indebtedness we can incur; however, we are subject to and carefully monitor the limits placed on us by our credit providers and those that assign ratings on our company. 
 At September 30, 2024, our debt-to-equity ratio was 3.5 and our portfolio was comprised of 7.5 billion of commercial mortgage loans and 0.4 billion of subordinate loans. In order to achieve our return on equity, we generally finance our mortgage loans with 2.0 to 3.0 turns of leverage and generally do not finance our subordinate loan portfolio given built-in inherent structural leverage. Consequently, depending on our portfolio mix, our debt-to-equity ratio may exceed our previously disclosed thresholds.

(1) Represents total debt less cash and net loan proceeds held by servicer (recorded with Other Assets, see "Note 6 Other Assets" for more information) to total stockholders' equity. 

Contractual Obligations, Liquidity, and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to fund and maintain our assets and operations, repay borrowings, make distributions to our stockholders and other general business needs. We utilize various sources of cash in order to meet our liquidity needs in the next twelve months, which is considered the short-term, and the longer term. 
 Our current debt obligations consist of 1.3 billion, at face value, of corporate debt, 5.5 billion of asset specific financings, and 282.4 million of debt related to real estate owned. Our corporate debt includes 763.3 million of term loan borrowings and 500.0 million of senior secured notes. Our asset specific financings are generally tied to the underlying loans, and we anticipate repayments of 1.3 billion of secured debt arrangements in the short term. Specifics about our secured debt arrangements and corporate debt maturities and obligations are discussed below. 
 In addition to our debt obligations, as of September 30, 2024, we had 503.9 million of unfunded loan commitments. We expect that approximately 440.7 million will be funded to existing borrowers in the short term. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 194.3 million of cash on hand, 105.8 million of loan proceeds held by servicer and held approximately 375.1 million of unencumbered assets. We also had 2.0 billion of undrawn capacity under our Secured Debt Arrangements and 179.7 million of additional capacity on our construction financing secured by our Brooklyn Development property which is available to fund future construction costs. 
 We maintain policies relating to our use of leverage. See "Leverage Policies" above. In the future, we may seek to raise further equity or debt capital or engage in other forms of borrowings in order to fund future investments or to refinance expiring indebtedness. 
 We generally intend to hold our assets for investment, although we may sell certain of our investments in order to manage our interest rate risk and liquidity needs, meet other operating objectives and adapt to market conditions. 
 To maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, we must distribute annually at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain. These distribution requirements limit our ability to retain earnings and replenish or increase capital for operations.

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we further upsized the facility by 242.1 million 314.6 million, assuming conversion into USD). 
 Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we upsized the Atlas Facility by 113.5 million and the Barclays facility by 300.0 million. Furthermore, we have repaid the full amount of borrowings outstanding on both the Goldman Sachs USD and Santander EUR facilities. 
 Refer to "Note 7 Secured Debt Arrangements, Net" of our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure regarding our secured credit facilities. 
 Barclays Private Securitization 
 We are party to a private securitization with the Barclays Private Securitization. Commercial mortgage loans currently financed under the Barclays Private Securitization are denominated in GBP, EUR, SEK. 
 Refer to "Note 7 Secured Debt Arrangements, Net" of our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure regarding our Barclays Private Securitization. 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 In March 2023, we entered into a Revolving Credit Facility administered by Bank of America, N.A. The Revolving Credit Facility matures in March 2026 and is secured by certain of our qualifying commercial mortgage loans and real property owned assets. As of September 30, 2024, our Revolving Credit Facility had a capacity of 160.0 million and requires that we maintain an interest coverage ratio of 1.3:1. See "Debt Covenants" below for additional discussion. 
 Refer to "Note 7 Secured Debt Arrangements, Net" of our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure regarding our Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Senior Secured Term Loans

 Senior Secured Notes 
 In June 2021, we issued 500.0 million of the 4.625 2029 Notes, for which we received net proceeds of 495.0 million, after deducting initial purchasers' discounts and commissions. The 2029 Notes had a carrying value of 496.2 million and 495.6 million, net of deferred financing costs of 3.8 million and 4.4 million, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Refer to "Note 9 Senior Secured Notes, Net" of our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure regarding our 2029 Notes. 
 Debt Related to Real Estate Owned 
 In August 2022, we obtained 164.8 million in construction financing on the Brooklyn Development property when we acquired legal title of the property. As of September 30, 2024, the construction financing had a carrying value of 206.4 million, net of 2.3 million in deferred financing costs. 
 In June 2024, we obtained a 73.7 million mortgage secured by our the D.C. Hotel property. As of September 30, 2024, the mortgage loan had a carrying value of 72.5 million, net of 1.2 million in deferred financing costs. 
 Refer to "Note 5 Real Estate Owned" of our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure regarding our debt related to real estate owned. 
 Dividends 
 We intend to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of our common stock. U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and that we pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we annually distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income. We generally intend over time to pay dividends to our stockholders in an amount equal to our net taxable income, if and to the extent authorized by our board of directors. Any distributions we make are at the discretion of our board of directors and depend upon, among other things, our actual results of operations. These results and our ability to pay distributions are affected by various factors, including the net interest and other income from our portfolio, our operating expenses and any other expenditures. If our cash available for distribution is less than our net taxable income, we could be required to sell assets or borrow funds to make cash distributions or we may make a portion of the required distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 6,770,393 shares of our Series B-1 Preferred Stock outstanding. The Series B-1 Preferred Stock pay cumulative cash dividends, which are payable quarterly in equal amounts in arrears on the 15th day of each January, April, July and October: at a rate of 7.25 per annum of the 25.00 per share liquidation preference. Except under certain limited circumstances, the Series B-1 Preferred Stock is generally not convertible into or exchangeable for any other property or any other of our securities at the election of the holders. On and after July 15, 2026, we may, at our option, redeem the shares at a redemption price of 25.00, plus any accrued unpaid dividends to, but not including, the date of the redemption.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 
 Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that involve the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties. The most critical accounting policies involve decisions and assessments that affect our reported assets and liabilities, as well as reported revenues and expenses. We believe that all of the decisions and assessments upon which these financial statements are based are reasonable based upon information currently available to us. The accounting policies and estimates that we consider to be most critical to an investor's understanding of our financial results and condition and require complex management judgment are discussed below. 
 There have been no material changes to our Critical Accounting Policies described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K under "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates." 
 For a complete listing and description of our significant accounting policies, refer to "Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to our consolidated financial statements of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Real Estate Owned (and Related Debt) 
 In order to maximize recovery against a defaulted loan, we may assume legal title or physical possession of the underlying collateral through foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. Foreclosed properties are classified as real estate owned and recognized at fair value on our condensed consolidated balance sheets in accordance with the acquisition method under ASC 805. Real estate assets acquired may include land, building, FF E, and intangible assets. In accordance ASC 820, we may utilize the income, market or cost approach (or combination thereof) to determine fair value. 
 When determining the fair value of a real estate asset under the income approach, we make certain assumptions including, but not limited to, consideration of projected operating cash flows, comparable selling prices and projected cash flows from the eventual disposition of the real estate asset based upon our estimate of a capitalization rate and discount rate. 
 When determining the fair value of real estate assets under the market or sales comparison approach, we compare the property to similar properties in the marketplace. Although we exercise significant judgment to identify similar properties, and may also consult independent third-party valuation experts to assist, our assessment of fair value is subject to uncertainty and sensitive to our selection of comparable properties. 
 When determining the fair value of real estate assets under the cost approach, we measure fair value as the replacement cost of these assets. This approach also requires significant judgment, and our estimate of replacement cost could vary from actual replacements costs. 
 At times we may classify real estate assets as held for sale in the period in which they meet the criteria under ASC 360 as discussed in "Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to our consolidated financial statements of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Once a real estate asset is classified as held for sale, depreciation is no longer recorded, and the asset is reported at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less cost to sell. The fair value of real estate assets classified as held for sale is determined using the appropriate methodologies noted in the preceding paragraph and the real estate asset's fair value is subject to uncertainty, as the actual sales price of the real estate asset could differ from those assumed in our valuations. 
 Once real estate assets have been recorded at fair value, they are evaluated for impairment on a quarterly basis. A real estate asset is considered impaired when the sum of estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the real estate asset over the estimated remaining holding period is less than the carrying value of such real estate asset. An impairment charge is recorded equal to the excess of the carrying value of the real estate asset over the fair value. When determining the fair value of a real estate asset for the purpose of assessing impairment, we make certain assumptions including, but not limited to: 
 58 

consideration of projected operating cash flows, intended holding period of the real estate, comparable selling prices and projected cash flows from the eventual disposition of the real estate based upon our estimate of a capitalization rate and discount rate. While we exercise significant judgment in generating our assumptions, the asset's fair value is subject to uncertainty, as actual operating cash flows and disposition proceeds could differ from those assumed in our valuations. Additionally, the output is sensitive to the assumptions used in calculating any potential impairment. 
 Please refer to "Note 3 Fair Value Disclosure" and "Note 5 Assets and Liabilities Related to Real Estate Owned" for more information regarding real estate owned and our valuation methodology as well as "Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to our consolidated financial statements of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Current Expected Credit Losses 
 We measure and record potential expected credit losses related to our loan portfolio in accordance with the CECL Standard. The CECL Standard requires an entity to consider historical loss experience, current conditions, and a reasonable and supportable forecast of the macroeconomic environment. We have adopted the WARM method to determine a General CECL Allowance for the majority of loans in our portfolio, applied on a collective basis by assets with similar risk characteristics. If we determine that a borrower or sponsor is experiencing financial difficulty, we will record loan-specific allowances (our Specific CECL Allowance) in accordance with a practical expedient prescribed by the CECL Standard. 
 General CECL Allowance 
 There are a number of significant assumptions required to estimate our General CECL Allowance which include deriving and applying an annual historical loss rate, estimating the impacts of current and future macroeconomic conditions and forecasting the timing of expected repayments, satisfactions and future fundings. 
 We derive an annual historical loss rate based on a CMBS database with historical losses from 1998 through the first quarter of 2024 provided by Trepp. We apply various filters to arrive at a CMBS dataset most analogous to our current portfolio from which we determine an appropriate historical loss rate. This historical loss rate, and ultimately the General CECL Allowance we derive, is sensitive to the CMBS dataset we select. 
 We adjust our determined annual historical loss rate based on our outlook of the macroeconomic environment, for a reasonable and supportable forecast period. Selection of a forecast period is a matter of judgment and our General CECL Allowance is sensitive to this input. 
 We develop our expectations for the future macroeconomic environment and its potential impact on the performance of loans in our portfolio, by analyzing various market factors, such as unemployment rate, market liquidity and price indexes relevant to commercial real estate sector. This assessment requires the use of significant judgment in selecting relevant market factors and analyzing their correlation with historical loss rates. The future macroeconomic environment is subject to uncertainty as the actual future macroeconomic environment could vary from our expectations. 
 Additionally, there are assumptions provided to us by the Manager that represent their best estimate as to loan expected term, future fundings, and timing of loan repayments. These assumptions, although made with the most available information at the time of the estimate, are subjective and actual activity may not follow the estimated schedule. These assumptions impact the future balances that the loss rate will be applied to and as such impact our General CECL Allowance. As we acquire new loans and the Manager monitors loan and sponsor performance, these estimates may change each period. Refer to "Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and "Note 4 Commercial Mortgage Loans, Subordinate Loans and Other Lending Assets, Net" for further discussion regarding our General CECL Allowance. 
 Specific CECL Allowance 
 When we determine that a borrower or sponsor is experiencing financial difficulty, we evaluate the related loan for loan-specific allowances, under the practical expedient prescribed by the CECL Standard. Determining that a borrower or sponsor is experiencing financial difficulty requires the use of significant judgment and can be based on several factors subject to uncertainty. These factors can include, but are not limited to, whether cash from the borrower's operations are sufficient to cover current and future debt service requirements, the borrower's ability to potentially refinance the loan, and other circumstances that 
 59 

can affect the borrower's ability to satisfy their obligations in accordance the terms of the loan. When utilizing the practical expedient for collateral dependent loans, the current expected credit losses is determined as the difference between the fair value of the underlying collateral, adjusted for estimated costs to sell when applicable, and the carrying value of the loan (prior to the current expected credit losses), as repayment or satisfaction of a loan is dependent on a sale of the underlying collateral. Collateral-dependent loans evaluated for a Specific CECL Allowance are removed from the General CECL Allowance pool. 
 The fair value of the underlying collateral is determined by using method(s) such as discounted cash flow, the market approach, or direct capitalization approach. These methods require the use of key unobservable inputs, which are inherently uncertain and subjective. Our estimate of fair value is sensitive to both the valuation methodology selected and inputs used. Determining a suitable valuation method and selecting the appropriate key unobservable inputs and assumptions requires significant judgment and consideration of factors specific to the underlying collateral being assessed. Additionally, the key unobservable inputs and assumptions used may vary depending on the information available to us and market conditions as of the valuation date. As such, the fair value that we derive and use in calculating our Specific CECL Allowance, is subject to uncertainty and any actual losses, if incurred, could differ materially from our current expected credit losses. Refer to "Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and "Note 4 Commercial Mortgage Loans, Subordinate Loans and Other Lending Assets, Net" for further discussion regarding our Specific CECL Allowance. 
 Refer to "Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to our consolidated financial statements of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the complete listing and description of our significant accounting policies.

Item 3. Quantitative and Quali tative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We seek to manage our risks related to the credit quality of our assets, interest rates, liquidity, prepayment speeds, and market value, while, at the same time, seeking to provide an opportunity to stockholders to realize attractive risk-adjusted returns through ownership of our capital stock. While risks are inherent in any business enterprise, we seek to quantify and justify risks in light of available returns and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks we undertake. 
 Credit Risk 
 One of our strategic focuses is acquiring assets that we believe to be of high credit quality. We believe this strategy will generally keep our credit losses and financing costs low. However, we are subject to varying degrees of credit risk in connection with our other target assets. We seek to mitigate this risk by seeking to acquire high quality assets, at appropriate prices given anticipated and unanticipated losses, and by deploying a value-driven approach to underwriting and diligence, consistent with the Manager's historical investment strategy, with a focus on current cash flows and potential risks to cash flow. The Manager seeks to enhance its due diligence and underwriting efforts by accessing the Manager's knowledge base and industry contacts. Nevertheless, unanticipated credit losses could occur, which could adversely impact our operating results. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including fiscal and monetary policies, and domestic and international economic and political considerations, as well as other factors beyond our control. We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our target assets and our related financing obligations. 
 To the extent consistent with maintaining our REIT qualification, we seek to manage risk exposure to protect our portfolio of financial assets against the effects of major interest rate changes. We generally seek to manage this risk by: 
 attempting to structure our financing agreements to have a range of different maturities, terms, amortization and interest rate adjustment periods; 

using hedging instruments and interest rate swaps, when we deem appropriate; and 

to the extent available and appropriate, using securitization financing to better match the maturity of our financing with the duration of our assets. 

The following table estimates the hypothetical impact on our net interest income for the twelve-month period following September 30, 2024, assuming an immediate increase or decrease of 50 basis points in the applicable interest rate benchmark by currency in thousands, except per share data):

(2) Any such hypothetical impact on interest rates on our variable rate borrowings does not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur in a rising or falling interest rate environment. Further, in the event of a change in interest rates of that magnitude, we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to such a change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, this analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure. 

(3) Certain of our floating rate loans are subject to index floors. 

61 

Prepayment Risk 
 Prepayment risk is the risk that principal will be repaid at a different rate than anticipated, causing the return on an asset to be less than expected. In certain cases, we adapt to prepayment risk by stating prepayment penalties in loan agreements. 
 Market Risk 
 Commercial mortgage assets are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, national, regional and local economic conditions (which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors); local real estate conditions; changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments; construction quality, age and design; demographic factors; retroactive changes to building or similar codes; pandemics; natural disasters and other acts of god. In addition, decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral and the potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay the underlying loans or loans, as the case may be, which could also cause us to suffer losses. Market volatility has been particularly heightened due to the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 and its variants have disrupted economic activities and could have a continued significant adverse effect on economic and market conditions including rising inflation, increases in interest rates, limited lending from financial institutions, depressed asset values, and limited market liquidity. 
 Inflation 
 Virtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature. As a result, interest rates and other factors influence our performance far more so than does inflation. Changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates. Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and distributions are determined by our board of directors consistent with our obligation to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, excluding net capital gains and determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction, on an annual basis in order to maintain our REIT qualification. In each case, our activities and balance sheets are measured with reference to historical cost and/or fair market value without considering inflation. 
 Currency Risk 
 Some of our loans and secured debt arrangements are denominated in a foreign currency and subject to risks related to fluctuations in currency rates. We seek to mitigate this exposure through foreign currency forward contracts, which match the net principal and interest of our foreign currency loans and secured debt arrangements. 
 Item 4. Controls an d Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, based on their evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) required by paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15, have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to give reasonable assurances to the timely collection, evaluation and disclosure of information relating to our company that would potentially be subject to disclosure under the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. 
 During the period ended September 30, 2024, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within our company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in our periodic reports.
