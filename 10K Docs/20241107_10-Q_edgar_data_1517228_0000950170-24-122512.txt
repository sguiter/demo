 billion in cash, to be paid by Amphenol upon closing. The sale is expected to close within the first quarter of 2025 , subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of applicable regulatory approvals. The Company determined the anticipated sale of the OWN segment and DAS business unit met the held for sale criteria and the discontinued operations criteria in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 360-10, Impairment and Disposal of Long Lived Assets , and ASC No. 205-20, Presentation of Financial Statements: Discontinued Operations, in the third quarter of 2024 due to its relative size and strategic rationale. For all periods presented, amounts in these consolidated financial statements have been recast to reflect the discontinuation of the OWN segment and DAS business unit in accordance with guidance. The Company completed the acquisition of certain assets of Casa Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Casa) on June 7, 2024 (the Casa Transaction). As part of the Casa Transaction, the Company acquired certain assets (the Casa Assets) and assumed certain specified liabilities (the Casa Liabilities) of Casa. The sale was conducted pursuant to the bid procedures (the Bid Procedures) established in the chapter 11 cases of Casa Systems, Inc. and certain affiliates in the United States (U.S.) Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the Bankruptcy Court). Pursuant to the Bid Procedures, the Company was designated as the successful bidder following an auction held on May 29, 2024. On June 5, 2024, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order authorizing the sale of the Casa Assets to the Company pursuant to section 363 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (subject to the terms thereof). The sale closed on June 7, 2024 and, at such time, the Company funded the purchase price of million and settled certain assumed Casa Liabilities, with cash on hand. The Company plans to integrate this strategic acquisition into its Access Network Solutions (ANS) segment and expects the acquisition to strengthen its ANS segment s position by enhancing its virtual cable modem termination systems CMTS) and passive optical network PON) product offerings, which will enable customers to migrate to distributed access architecture (DAA) solutions at their own speed, and further grow its customer base. See Note 2 for additional discussion of the Casa Transaction. On January 9, 2024, the Company completed the sale of its Home Networks (Home) segment and substantially all of the associated segment assets and liabilities (Home business) to Vantiva SA (Vantiva) pursuant to the Call Option Agreement entered into on October 2, 2023 and Purchase Agreement dated as of December 7, 2023. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company determined the sale of the Home business met the held for sale criteria and the discontinued operations criteria in accordance with accounting guidance. All prior period amounts in these condensed consolidated financial statements have been recast to reflect the discontinuation of the Home business. The discussions in these condensed consolidated financial statements relate solely to the Company s continuing operations, unless otherwise noted. As a result, the Company is reporting financial performance based on the following remaining three operating segments, which excludes the OWN segment, DAS business unit in NICS and Home business: Connectivity and Cable Solutions (CCS), NICS (excluding DAS) and ANS. See Note 3 for further discussion of the discontinued operations related to the OWN segment, DAS business unit and Home business.

billion outstanding on its senior unsecured notes that mature on June 15, 2025 (the 2025 Notes), which is less than a year from the date that these condensed consolidated financial statements are issued for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The Company does not currently have sufficient cash or liquidity to repay the 2025 Notes when they mature on June 15, 2025. Proceeds of approximately billion from the pending sale of the Company s OWN segment and DAS business unit may be used under certain circumstances to retire the 2025 Notes due to the flexibility under the Company s debt documents. The Company believes this is probable of occurring and will alleviate substantial doubt about the Company s ability to operate as a going concern. Concurrently, the Company is negotiating with creditors to explore both restructuring and/or refinancing of the 2025 Notes. No commitments have been obtained regarding this alternative as of the filing date, although it remains part of the Company s plans to mitigate conditions that give rise to substantial doubt about the Company s ability to operate as a going concern. Management has assessed its plan to mitigate the conditions that give rise to substantial doubt and, considering the pending sale of the Company s OWN segment and DAS business unit, management believes such plan is probable and will alleviate substantial doubt about the Company s ability to operate as a going concern. 
 direct customer accounted for or more of the Company s total net sales during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net sales to Charter Communications, Inc. (Charter) accounted for of the Company s total net sales during the three months ended September 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Comcast Corporation and affiliates (Comcast) and Charter each accounted for of the Company s total net sales. Accounts receivable from Comcast and Anixter International Inc. and its affiliates (Anixter) represented approximately and , respectively, of accounts receivable as of September 30, 2024 . Other than Comcast and Anixter, direct customer accounted for or more of the Company s accounts receivable. The Company relies on sole suppliers or a limited group of suppliers for certain key components, subassemblies and modules and a limited group of contract manufacturers to manufacture a significant portion of its products. Any disruption or termination of these arrangements could have a material adverse impact on the Company s results of operations.

 of the Company's Series A convertible preferred stock (the Convertible Preferred Stock), which was sold to Carlyle to fund a portion of the acquisition of ARRIS International plc (ARRIS) in 2019. See Note 11 for further discussion of the Convertible Preferred Stock. Other than transactions related to the Convertible Preferred Stock and the Company s continuing involvement with Vantiva discussed in Note 3, there were material related party transactions for the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 Commitments and Contingencies . The Company records a provision for estimated future warranty claims as cost of sales based upon the historical relationship of warranty claims to sales and specifically identified warranty issues. The Company bases its estimates on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and revises its estimates, as appropriate, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that revisions may be necessary. Such revisions may be material.

million (undiscounted), and such advance payments will be credited and applied to future orders on a quarterly basis beginning in 2027 through 2031 based on the ability to meet certain minimum purchase requirements. Advance payments of million and million are capitalized as other noncurrent assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. Under this agreement, the Company committed to purchases of raw materials that began in 2023, growing to a level of approximately million per year by 2026 and continuing through 2032. Legal Proceedings The Company is party to certain intellectual property claims and also periodically receives notices asserting that its products infringe on another party s patents and other intellectual property rights. These claims and assertions, whether against the Company directly or against its customers, could require the Company to pay damages or royalties, stop offering the relevant products and/or cease other activities. The Company may also be called upon to indemnify certain customers for costs related to products sold to such customers. The outcome of these claims and notices is uncertain, and a reasonable estimate of the loss from unfavorable outcomes in certain of these matters either cannot be determined or is estimated at the minimum amount of a range of estimates. The actual loss, through settlement or trial, could be material and may vary significantly from the Company s estimates. From time to time, the Company may also be involved as a plaintiff in certain intellectual property claims. Gain contingencies, if any, are recognized when they are realized. The Company is also either a plaintiff or a defendant in certain other pending legal matters in the normal course of business. Management believes none of these other pending legal matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company s business or financial condition upon final disposition.

and , respectively. There were goodwill impairments identified during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024. See Note 4 for further discussion. During the third quarter of 2023, the Company concluded that a triggering event occurred, primarily due to a sustained decrease in the market value of the Company s debt and common stock affecting the overall business and changes in expected future cash flows due to reduced earnings forecasts and current macroeconomic conditions, including a rising interest rate environment. The Company performed an interim quantitative goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2023 for its ANS and Building and Data Center Connectivity (BDCC) reporting units, which were most sensitive to negative performance and outlook, to compare the fair values of the reporting units to their carrying amounts, including the goodwill. As a result, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in asset impairments in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations to partially write down the carrying amount of the ANS reporting unit goodwill. As of September 30, 2023, there was no impairment identified in the BDCC reporting unit within the CCS reportable segment. See Note 4 for further discussion. Subsequently, the Company s ANS and BDCC reporting units failed the annual goodwill impairment test, and partial impairments were recorded as of October 1, 2023. As a result of the new segment structure and certain other intrasegment realignments, as of January 1, 2024, the BDCC and Network Cable and Connectivity (NCC) reporting units are being referred to as Enterprise and Broadband, respectively, which are both in the CCS reportable segment. Considering the low headroom going forward for each of the ANS and Enterprise reporting units, there is a risk for future impairment in the event of declines in general economic, market or business conditions or any significant unfavorable change in the forecasted cash flows, weighted average cost of capital or growth rates. If current and long-term projections for the ANS and Enterprise reporting units are not realized or decrease materially, the Company may be required to recognize additional goodwill impairment charges, and these charges could be material to the Company s results of operations. Long-lived Assets Long-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment, intangible assets with finite lives and right of use assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable, based on the undiscounted cash flows expected to be derived from the use and ultimate disposition of the assets. Assets identified as impaired are adjusted to estimated fair value. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are evaluated each reporting period for impairment based on a qualitative assessment and are then measured at fair value if an impairment is determined to exist. Other than certain assets impaired as a result of restructuring actions and as part of discontinued operations, t here were definite-lived intangible or other long-lived asset impairments identified during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023 .

 million on a pretax loss of million and income tax expense of million on a pretax loss of million, respectively. The Company s income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , were unfavorably impacted by million and million, respectively, of additional valuation allowance related to current year federal and state interest limitation carryforwards and U.S. anti-deferral provisions, partially offset by tax benefits related to federal tax credits. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company used a discrete calculation to compute the net tax benefit associated with external interest. Using the estimated annual tax rate for this component of income would have produced significant variability in the estimated annual effective tax rate, and use of the discrete method for this component results in the best estimate of the estimated annual effective tax rate. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized an income tax benefit of million on a pretax loss of million and an income tax benefit of million on a pretax loss of million, respectively. The Company s tax benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, was unfavorably impacted by a goodwill impairment charge of million for which minimal tax benefits were recorded. The Company s tax benefit was favorably impacted by million related to tax law changes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. In addition to the unfavorable impact of the goodwill impairment charge mentioned above, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company s tax benefit was also unfavorably impacted by e xcess tax costs of million related to equity compensation awards but favorably impacted by million related to the release of various uncertain tax positions . 
 million and million shares, respectively, of outstanding equity-based compensation awards were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because the effect was antidilutive or the performance conditions were not met. Of those amounts, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , million and million shares, respectively, would have been considered dilutive if the Company had not been in a loss from continuing operations position. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , million and million shares, respectively, of outstanding equity-based compensation awards were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because the effect was antidilutive or the performance conditions were not met. Of those amounts, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , million and million shares, respectively, would have been considered dilutive if the Company had not been in a loss from continuing operations position. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , million and million, respectively, of as-if converted shares related to the Convertible Preferred Stock were excluded from the diluted share count because they were antidilutive. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , million and million, respectively, of as-if converted shares related to the Convertible Preferred Stock were excluded from the diluted share count because they were antidilutive; however, they may have been considered dilutive if the Company had not been in a loss from continuing operations position.

million and settled certain assumed Casa Liabilities, with cash on hand. The Company plans to integrate this strategic acquisition into its ANS segment and expects the acquisition to strengthen its ANS segment s position by enhancing its virtual CMTS and PON product offerings, which will enable customers to migrate to DAA solutions at their own speed, and further grow its customer base. The Company recorded the purchase of the Casa Transaction using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations , and, accordingly, recognized the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values as of the date of acquisition. As of September 30, 2024, the valuation studies necessary to determine the fair market value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are preliminary, including the validation of the underlying cash flows used to determine the fair value of the identified intangible assets. The final determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities will be completed within the one-year measurement period from the date of acquisition, which is necessary to adequately analyze all the factors used in establishing the asset and liability fair values as of the acquisition date, including, but not limited to intangible assets, accounts receivable, inventory and personal property.

The impact of measurement period adjustments to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations was immaterial for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The goodwill arising from the Casa Transaction is believed to result from the company s reputation in the marketplace and assembled workforce and is expected to be fully deductible for income tax purposes. Various valuation techniques which use significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy, were used to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Using these valuation approaches requires the Company to make certain estimates and assumptions. The estimated fair values are expected to change as the Company completes its valuation analyses of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

 billion in cash, to be paid by Amphenol upon closing. The OWN segment and DAS business unit qualified as held for sale per ASC 360-10 in the third quarter of 2024 and were classified as a discontinued operation per ASC 205-20, as the Company determined, qualitatively and quantitatively, that this transaction represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on the Company s operations and financial results. As such, activity directly attributable to the OWN segment and DAS business unit has been removed from continuing operations and presented in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented. In addition, all assets and liabilities of the OWN segment and DAS business unit were classified as assets and liabilities held for sale on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. On January 9, 2024, the Company completed the sale of the Home business to Vantiva pursuant to the Call Option Agreement entered into on October 2, 2023 and the Purchase Agreement dated as of December 7, 2023, in exchange for (i) shares of Vantiva common stock representing a equity stake in Vantiva (determined on a fully diluted basis), (ii) in cash (in addition to cash paid in exchange for the cash on the Home business companies balance sheets) and (iii) an earn-out of up to million in the aggregate. The earn-out payments are contingent upon Vantiva achieving adjusted EBITDA equal to or greater than million for one or more of Vantiva s first five fiscal years following the closing of the transaction. The earn-out payment with respect to any fiscal year will be subject to an additional annual cap, the amount of which will depend on certain elections made by the Company following Vantiva reaching the million adjusted EBITDA threshold for the first time, and on Vantiva s maintenance of certain liquidity levels (after giving effect to such payment). The Home business qualified as held for sale per ASC 360-10 in the fourth quarter of 2023 and was classified as a discontinued operation per ASC 205-20, as the Company determined, qualitatively and quantitatively, that this transaction represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on the Company s operations and financial results. As such, activity directly attributable to the Home business has been removed from continuing operations and presented in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented. In addition, all assets and liabilities of the Home business were classified as assets and liabilities held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023, and in connection with the held for sale classification, the Company recognized a loss on classification as held for sale of million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Upon the closing of the transaction on January 9, 2024, the Company recognized an additional loss of million, which was included in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In conjunction with the closing of the Home business transaction, the Company entered into a transition service agreement with Vantiva (Vantiva TSA), whereby the Company provides and receives certain post-closing support on a transitional basis which is included in continuing operations in transition service agreement income. The terms of the Vantiva TSA vary based on the services provided thereunder, with the longest such term having a duration of sixteen months. The Vantiva TSA provides options to extend services for up to two renewal terms of three months each. Following the closing of the transaction, the Company also entered into a Supply Agreement with Vantiva (Vantiva Supply Agreement), whereby the Company sells certain retained inventory at cost, or market price if below cost, for a period of two years. The Company s investment in Vantiva is accounted for using the equity method of accounting, and the carrying value of the investment is included in other noncurrent assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company recognized a loss on its investment of million in the second quarter of 2024, as a result of recording its proportionate share of loss on its equity investment, which is recorded on a one-quarter lag basis in discontinued operations in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations beginning in the second quarter of 2024. The investment in the ordinary shares is subject to a lock-up period, until the earlier of eighteen months, or the occurrence of a change of control or the entry into an agreement that would result in a change of control, following closing. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a million loss on disposal of the Home business, with an incremental million loss on disposal related to settlements of certain retained obligations recognized during the third quarter.

Goodwill at December 31, 2023 reflects the reorganization of the Company s segment structure, as disclosed in Note 1. As a result of the new segment structure and certain other intrasegment realignments, as of January 1, 2024, the Company assessed goodwill for impairment due to changes in the composition of certain reporting units. The Company performed impairment testing immediately before the change and after the change once goodwill was reallocated and determined that no goodwill impairment existed. Additional goodwill of million resulting from the Casa acquisition is included in the other activity above as of September 30, 2024. For the quarter ended September 30,2024, the Company completed an impairment analysis for goodwill recorded within the NICS reporting unit, which is impacted by the pending divestiture of the DAS business. The quantitative assessment was used, and the Company determined that the fair value of the impacted reporting unit exceeded the carrying value and that impairment existed immediately prior to or subsequent to allocating goodwill to the disposal group that includes our DAS business. The Company allocated million of goodwill to the disposal group based on the relative fair value of the DAS business as compared to the NICS reporting unit, along with million of goodwill that was entirely attributable to its OWN reporting unit. Total goodwill for the disposal group of million has been classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2024.

The Company entered into the Vantiva Supply Agreement, pursuant to which the Company will sell the retained inventory to Vantiva at cost, or market price if below cost, for a period of two years following the close of the transaction. The Company s measurement of segment performance is adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization). The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as operating income (loss), adjusted to exclude depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring costs, asset impairments, equity-based compensation, transaction, transformation and integration costs and other items that the Company believes are useful to exclude in the evaluation of operating performance from period to period because these items are not representative of the Company s recurring business.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following narrative is an analysis of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The discussion is provided to increase the understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report as well as the audited consolidated financial statements, related notes thereto and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, including management s discussion and analysis regarding the application of critical accounting policies and the risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (2023 Annual Report). 
 We discuss certain financial measures in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, including adjusted EBITDA, that differ from measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States (U.S.). See "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures" included below for more information about these non-GAAP financial measures, including our reasons for including the measures and material limitations with respect to the usefulness of the measures. 
 Overview 
 We are a global provider of infrastructure solutions for communication, data center and entertainment networks. Our solutions for wired and wireless networks enable service providers, including cable, telephone and digital broadcast satellite operators and media programmers, to deliver media, voice, Internet Protocol (IP) data services and Wi-Fi to their subscribers and allow enterprises to experience constant wireless and wired connectivity across complex and varied networking environments. Our solutions are complemented by services including technical support, systems design and integration. We are a leader in digital video and IP television distribution systems, broadband access infrastructure platforms and equipment that delivers data and voice networks to homes. Our global leadership position is built upon innovative technology, broad solution offerings, high-quality and cost-effective customer solutions, and global manufacturing and distribution scale. 
 We completed the acquisition of certain assets of Casa Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Casa) on June 7, 2024 (the Casa Transaction). As part of the Casa Transaction, we acquired certain assets (the Casa Assets) and assumed certain specified liabilities (the Casa Liabilities) of Casa. The sale was conducted pursuant to the bid procedures (the Bid Procedures) established in the chapter 11 cases of Casa Systems, Inc. and certain affiliates in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the Bankruptcy Court). Pursuant to the Bid Procedures, we were designated as the successful bidder following an auction held on May 29, 2024. On June 5, 2024, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order authorizing the sale of the Casa Assets to us pursuant to section 363 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (subject to the terms thereof). The sale closed on June 7, 2024 and, at such time, we funded the purchase price of 45.1 million and settled certain assumed Casa Liabilities, with cash on hand. We plan to integrate this strategic acquisition into our Access Network Solutions (ANS) segment and expect the acquisition to strengthen our ANS segment s position by enhancing its virtual cable modem termination systems and passive optical network product offerings, which will enable customers to migrate to distributed access architecture solutions at their own speed, and further grow our customer base. We recorded 0.4 million and 1.4 million of transaction and integration costs for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, related to the Casa Transaction, and these costs were recognized in selling, general and administrative expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 2 in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Casa Transaction.

CommScope NEXT 
 Since 2021, we have been engaged in a transformation initiative referred to as CommScope NEXT, which is designed to drive shareholder value through three pillars: profitable growth, operational efficiency and portfolio optimization. We believe these efforts are critical to making us more competitive and allowing us to invest in growth, de-leverage our indebtedness and maximize stockholder and other stakeholder value in the future. In 2022, CommScope NEXT generated positive impacts on net sales, profitability and cash flow from our execution on pricing initiatives, capacity expansion and operational efficiencies. In 2023, we experienced headwinds related to a slow-down in spending by our customers as discussed further below, but we continued to execute under CommScope NEXT to improve our profitability and cash flows by continuing to drive operational efficiencies and focusing on portfolio optimization. We continue to focus on driving operational efficiencies and other cost savings initiatives as well as portfolio optimization, all of which should enable us to take advantage of the expected recovery in demand in the fourth quarter of 2024. To that end, we incurred (0.9) million and 30.6 million of net restructuring costs (credits) and 19.5 million and 45.8 million of transaction, transformation and integration costs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily related to CommScope NEXT initiatives. In addition, we incurred 22.0 million and 43.1 million of net restructuring costs and 14.6 million and 17.7 million of transaction, transformation and integration costs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. We expect to continue to incur such costs during the remainder of 2024 as we continue executing on CommScope NEXT initiatives, and the resulting charges and cash requirements could be material. 
 On July 18, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement with Amphenol Corporation, a Delaware corporation (Amphenol), pursuant to which Amphenol has agreed to acquire our Outdoor Wireless Networks (OWN) segment and the Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS) business unit of our Networking, Intelligent Cellular Security Solutions (NICS) segment in exchange for approximately 2.1 billion in cash, to be paid by Amphenol upon closing. The sale is expected to close within the first quarter of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of applicable regulatory approvals. We determined the anticipated sale of our OWN segment and DAS business unit met the held for sale criteria and the discontinued operations criteria in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 360-10, Impairment and Disposal of Long Lived Assets , and ASC No. 205-20, Presentation of Financial Statements: Discontinued Operations, in the third quarter of 2024 due to its relative size and strategic rationale. For all periods presented, amounts in these consolidated financial statements have been recast to reflect the discontinuation of our OWN segment and DAS business unit in accordance with guidance. 
 On January 9, 2024, we completed the sale of our Home Networks (Home) segment and substantially all of the associated segment assets and liabilities (Home business) to Vantiva SA (Vantiva) pursuant to the Call Option Agreement entered into on October 2, 2023 and the Purchase Agreement dated as of December 7, 2023. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we determined the sale of our Home business met the held for sale criteria and the discontinued operations criteria in accordance with accounting guidance. All prior period amounts have been recast to reflect the discontinuation of our Home business. 
 Our continuing operations results include general corporate costs that were previously allocated to the OWN segment, DAS business unit and Home segment. These indirect costs, reflected on the corporate and other line item within our segment information below, are classified as continuing operations, since they were not directly attributable to these discontinued operations. Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, the corporate and other costs related to the Home segment have been reallocated to our remaining segments and partially offset by income from our transition services agreement with Vantiva. The corporate and other costs related to the OWN segment and DAS business will be reallocated to our remaining segments beginning in the first quarter of 2025. 
 Additionally, below we refer to certain supplementary Core financial measures, which reflect the results of the CCS, NICS excluding DAS, and ANS segments, in the aggregate, and exclude general corporate costs that were previously allocated to the OWN segment, DAS business unit and Home segment, since these costs were not directly attributable to the discontinued operations. The Core results represent the business results as currently managed and reported by the Company. Future results and the composition of any business divested in the future may vary and differ materially from the presentation of the Core financial measures. See the Segment Results section below for the aggregation of our Core financial measures. 
 Unless otherwise noted, the following discussions relate solely to our continuing operations. As a result, we are reporting financial performance based on the following remaining three operating segments, which excludes the OWN segment, DAS business unit in NICS and Home business: Connectivity and Cable Solutions (CCS), NICS (excluding DAS) and ANS. For further discussion of the discontinued operations related to our OWN segment, DAS business unit and Home business, see Note 3 in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 As of January 1, 2024, we shifted certain product lines from our CCS segment to our ANS segment to better align with how the businesses are managed. All prior period amounts have been recast to reflect these operating segment changes.

Impacts of Current Economic Conditions 
 In 2023, macroeconomic factors such as higher interest rates, inflation and concerns about a global economic slow-down softened demand for our products, with certain customers reducing purchases as they right-sized their inventories and others pausing capital spending. This industry recession has continued to negatively impact our net sales in all segments for the first three quarters of 2024. We are beginning to see a recovery in demand in certain businesses and expect to see additional recovery in demand later in 2024. 
 In 2023, we began implementing additional cost savings initiatives to improve profitability, and we continued to implement further initiatives during the first three quarters of 2024. These initiatives should enable us to take advantage of the expected recovery in demand later in 2024. If this expected recovery does not occur in 2024, our outlook will be materially impacted. 
 For more discussion on risks related to our customers, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 Other than an update to the impairment reviews of goodwill, there have been no changes in our critical accounting policies as disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 Asset Impairment Reviews 
 Impairment Reviews of Goodwill 
 Our interim goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2023 resulted in a partial impairment charge of 425.9 million for the ANS reporting unit. Our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2023, resulted in partial impairment charges of 99.1 million and 46.3 million for the Enterprise (previously Building and Data Center Connectivity) and ANS reporting units, respectively. As of the most recent interim impairment test on January 1, 2024, immediately before and after changes in the composition of those reporting units, the implied fair value of the Enterprise and ANS reporting units exceeded its respective carrying amount by 8 and 7 , respectively. 
 Considering the low headroom going forward for each of the ANS and Enterprise reporting units, management has continued to disclose the risk for future impairment in the event of declines in general economic, market or business conditions or any significant unfavorable change in the forecasted cash flows, weighted average cost of capital or growth rates. If current and long-term projections for the ANS and Enterprise reporting units are not realized or decrease materially, we may be required to recognize additional goodwill impairment charges, and these charges could be material to our results of operations. Consistent with the information previously provided in our 2023 Annual Report, the following table provides summary information regarding our reporting units with goodwill balances as of January 1, 2024, that have the lowest level of headroom. The table presents key assumptions used in our interim goodwill analysis, along with sensitivity analyses showing the effect of a change in certain key assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant, to the resulting fair value using an income approach.

Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 28.8 million, or 2.7 , compared to the prior year period primarily driven by increased sales volumes. Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 605.4 million, or 16.6 , compared to the prior year period as certain customers have continued their reduced purchasing as they right-size their inventories and others have continued their pause in capital spending. The increase in net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by higher net sales of 106.2 million in the CCS segment, partially offset by lower net sales of 45.1 million in the NICS segment and 32.3 million in the ANS segment. The decrease in net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by lower net sales of 288.0 million in the ANS segment, 238.5 million in the NICS segment and 78.9 million in the CCS segment. For further details by segment, see Segment Results below. 
 From a regional perspective, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period, net sales increased in the U.S. by 21.4 million, the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region by 6.2 million, Canada by 3.2 million, and the Asia Pacific (APAC) region 0.5 million, but decreased in the Caribbean and Latin American (CALA) region by 2.5 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period, net sales decreased in the U.S. by 428.5 million, the EMEA region by 93.0 million, the CALA region by 66.9 million, the APAC region by 15.0 million and Canada by 2.0 million. Net sales to customers located outside of the U.S. comprised 34.0 and 34.6 of total net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 34.2 and 33.7 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Foreign exchange rate changes did not have a material impact on our net sales during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year periods.

Gross profit (net sales less cost of sales) 
 Gross profit increased by 54.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily due to increased net sales volumes and favorable product mix, partially offset by higher freight costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit decreased by 195.2 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to lower net sales volumes, partially offset by favorable product mix and lower input costs. 
 Transition service agreement income 
 Transition service agreement (TSA) income is related to the TSA we entered into with Vantiva in conjunction with the closing of the transaction to divest of the Home business in January 2024. Under the TSA agreement, we are providing (and in some instances receiving) certain post-closing support on a transitional basis. The TSA has varying terms for duration up to sixteen months, depending on the service, and provides for options to extend services for up to two renewal terms of three months each. As of the end of the third quarter of 2024, the majority of the services have ceased. 
 33 

Selling, general and administrative expense 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, selling, general and administrative (SG A) expense increased by 17.0 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher variable incentive compensation expense of 17.2 million and higher transaction, transformation and integration costs of 4.9 million due to ongoing CommScope NEXT initiatives, partially offset by reductions due to cost savings initiatives and lower bad debt expense of 6.0 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, SG A expense decreased 36.6 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to cost savings initiatives and lower bad debt expense of 15.6 million, partially offset by higher transaction, transformation and integration costs of 28.1 million and higher variable incentive compensation expense of 7.8 million. We expect to continue to incur transaction, transformation and integration costs during the remainder of 2024, and the resulting charges and cash requirements could be material. 
 Research and development expense 
 Research and development (R D) expense decreased by 7.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily due to lower spending within the NICS segment. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, R D expense decreased by 62.7 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to lower spending within the NICS, CCS and ANS segments. R D activities generally involve ensuring that our products are capable of meeting the evolving technological needs of our customers, bringing new products to market and modifying existing products to better serve our customers.

Amortization of purchased intangible assets 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, amortization of purchased intangible assets was lower compared to the prior year periods because certain of our intangible assets became fully amortized. 
 Restructuring costs (credits), net 
 The net restructuring costs (credits) recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were primarily related to CommScope NEXT. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net restructuring costs (credits) were (0.9) million and 30.6 million, respectively, and we paid 8.1 million and 24.4 million, respectively, to settle restructuring liabilities. We expect to pay an additional 2.9 million during the remainder of 2024 related to restructuring actions that have been initiated. Additional restructuring actions related to CommScope NEXT are expected to be identified, and the resulting charges and cash requirements could be material. 
 Asset impairments 
 We did not record any asset impairment charges during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 425.9 million related to our ANS reporting unit within our ANS segment.

Foreign currency gain (loss) 
 Foreign currency gain (loss) includes the net foreign currency gains and losses resulting from the settlement of receivables and payables, foreign currency contracts and short-term intercompany advances in a currency other than the subsidiary s functional currency. The change in foreign currency gain (loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year periods was primarily driven by certain unhedged currencies. 
 Other income, net 
 The change in other income, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year periods was primarily driven by a gain of 8.6 million and 19.0 million, respectively, on the early extinguishment of debt related to our debt repurchases in the prior year periods. There were no debt repurchases during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Interest expense and Interest income 
 Interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 did not change significantly when compared to the prior year periods. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense was favorably impacted by lower long-term debt balances as a result of the debt repurchases in 2023, and unfavorably impacted by increased variable interest rate on our senior secured term loan due 2026 (2026 Term Loan) as a result of the Federal Reserve s increases in interest rates. Our weighted average effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings, including the impact of the interest rate swap contracts and the amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount, was 7.09 at September 30, 2024, 7.22 at December 31, 2023 and 7.23 at September 30, 2023. 
 Our interest expense and payments on our variable rate debt could increase if the Federal Reserve increases interest rates in the remainder of 2024. See Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk in our 2023 Annual Report for further discussion of our interest rate risk. 
 35 

Income tax (expense) benefit 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized income tax expense of 26.7 million on a pretax loss of 70.0 million and income tax expense of 41.2 million on a pretax loss of 356.7 million, respectively. Our income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were unfavorably impacted by 35.9 million and 103.7 million, respectively, of additional valuation allowance related to current year federal and state interest limitation carryforwards and U.S. anti-deferral provisions, partially offset by tax benefits related to federal tax credits. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used a discrete calculation to compute the net tax benefit associated with external interest. Using the estimated annual tax rate for this component of income would have produced significant variability in the estimated annual effective tax rate, and use of the discrete method for this component results in the best estimate of the estimated annual effective tax rate. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized an income tax benefit of 34.5 million on a pretax loss of 568.3 million and an income tax benefit of 74.4 million on a pretax loss of 756.3 million, respectively. Our tax benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, was unfavorably impacted by a goodwill impairment charge of 425.9 million for which minimal tax benefits were recorded. Our tax benefit was favorably impacted by 4.1 million related to tax law changes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. In addition to the unfavorable impact of the goodwill impairment charge mentioned above, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our tax benefit was also unfavorably impacted by excess tax costs of 7.1 million related to equity compensation awards but favorably impacted by 9.6 million related to the release of various uncertain tax positions.

Connectivity and Cable Solutions Segment 
 Net sales for the CCS segment increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher sales volumes in the Enterprise business. CCS segment net sales decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily due to lower sales volumes as certain customers paused spending in the first quarter as they right-sized their inventory levels. From a regional perspective, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, net sales increased in the U.S. by 93.1 million, the EMEA region by 19.5 million and Canada by 3.3 million, but decreased in the CALA region by 7.9 million and the APAC region by 1.8 million, compared to the prior year period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net sales decreased in the U.S. by 52.1 million and the CALA region by 37.2 million, but increased in the APAC region by 6.4 million and the EMEA region by 4.0 million, and remained the same in Canada, compared to the prior year period. Foreign exchange rate changes did not have a material impact on our CCS net sales during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 38 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, CCS segment operating income and adjusted EBITDA increased compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher sales volumes, favorable product mix and lower input costs, partially offset by higher SG A costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, CCS segment operating income and adjusted EBITDA increased compared to the prior year period primarily due to favorable product mix and lower R D, SG A and input costs, partially offset by lower sales volumes. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, CCS segment operating income was also favorably impacted by reductions in restructuring costs of 16.6 million and 13.9 million, respectively, partially offset by increases in transaction, transition and integration costs of 3.5 million and 11.0 million, respectively. Restructuring costs and transaction, transition and integration costs are not reflected in adjusted EBITDA. See Reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA below. 
 Networking, Intelligent Cellular and Security Solutions Segment 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, NICS segment net sales decreased compared to the prior year periods primarily due to lower sales volumes of our Ruckus products driven by lower demand and channel inventory digestion. From a regional perspective, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, NICS segment net sales decreased in the U.S. by 29.6 million, the EMEA region by 10.3 million, Canada by 5.3 million and the APAC region by 2.3 million, but increased in the CALA region by 2.4 million, compared to the prior year period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, NICS segment net sales decreased in the U.S. by 139.9 million, the EMEA region by 57.9 million, the APAC region by 29.3 million, Canada by 8.2 million and the CALA region by 3.2 million compared to the prior year period. Foreign exchange rate changes did not have a material impact on our NICS net sales during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, NICS segment operating income and adjusted EBITDA decreased compared to the prior year periods primarily due to lower sales volumes, lower pricing and higher freight costs, partially offset by lower R D costs and favorable product mix. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, NICS segment operating income and adjusted EBITDA were favorably impacted by lower SG A costs primarily due to cost savings initiatives. NICS segment operating income was also favorably impacted by a gain of 3.5 million related to the settlement of an intellectual property litigation claim during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The impacts of intellectual property litigation settlements are not reflected in adjusted EBITDA. See Reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA below. 
 Access Network Solutions Segment 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, net sales decreased in the ANS segment compared to the prior year periods primarily due to lower sales volumes as certain customers have paused spending as they right-size their inventory levels. From a regional perspective, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, ANS segment net sales decreased in the U.S. by 42.1 million and the EMEA region by 3.0 million, but increased in Canada by 5.2 million, the APAC region by 4.6 million and the CALA region by 3.0 million, compared to the prior year period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, ANS segment net sales decreased in the U.S. by 236.5 million, the EMEA region by 39.1 million and the CALA region by 26.5 million, but increased in the APAC region by 7.9 million and Canada by 6.2 million, compared to the prior year period. Foreign exchange rate changes did not have a material impact on our ANS net sales during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Excluding the goodwill impairment charge of 425.9 million from operating loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, ANS segment operating loss increased and adjusted EBITDA decreased for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year periods. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, ANS segment operating loss and adjusted EBITDA were negatively impacted by lower sales volumes, unfavorable product mix, and higher R D and input costs, compared to the prior year period. ANS segment operating loss and adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were negatively impacted by lower sales volumes, partially offset by benefits from lower SG A, R D and input costs, and favorable product mix. The reductions in SG A costs impacting the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to cost savings initiatives. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, ANS segment operating loss was also favorably impacted by reductions in amortization expense of 13.1 million, transaction, transformation and integration costs of 5.6 million and restructuring costs of 2.7 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating loss was favorably impacted by a reduction in amortization expense of 50.1 million, partially offset by an increase in restructuring costs of 14.4 million. Goodwill impairment charges, restructuring costs, transaction, transformation and integration costs and amortization expense are not reflected in adjusted EBITDA.

(1) Includes cash and cash equivalents in assets held for sale of 64.2 million and 43.5 million as of September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023, respectively. 

(2) Working capital is net of assets and liabilities held for sale and consists of current assets of 2,078.4 million less current liabilities of 2,215.3 million as of September 30, 2024 and current assets of 2,128.2 million less current liabilities of 929.5 million as of December 31, 2023. 

(3) Total capitalization includes long-term debt, including the current portion, Series A convertible preferred stock (the Convertible Preferred Stock) and stockholders deficit. 

Our principal sources of liquidity on a short-term basis are cash and cash equivalents, cash flows provided by operations and availability under our credit facilities. On a long-term basis, our potential sources of liquidity also include raising capital through the issuance of additional equity and/or debt. 
 The primary uses of liquidity include debt service requirements, voluntary debt repayments, redemptions or purchases on the open market, working capital requirements, capital expenditures, business separation transaction costs, transformation costs, restructuring costs, dividends related to the Convertible Preferred Stock if we elect to pay such dividends in cash, litigation settlements, income tax payments and other contractual obligations. As of September 30, 2024, we have 1.27 billion outstanding on our 6.00 senior unsecured notes which mature on June 15, 2025 (the 2025 Notes), which is less than a year from the date that the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. We do not currently have sufficient cash or liquidity to repay the 2025 Notes when they mature on June 15, 2025. 
 Proceeds of approximately 2.1 billion from the pending sale of our OWN segment and DAS business unit may be used under certain circumstances to retire the 2025 Notes due to flexibility under our debt documents. We believe this is probable of occurring and will alleviate substantial doubt about our ability to operate as a going concern. 
 Concurrently, we are negotiating with creditors to explore both restructuring and/or refinancing of the 2025 Notes. No commitments have been obtained regarding this alternative as of the filing date, although it remains part of our plans to mitigate conditions that give rise to substantial doubt about our ability to operate as a going concern. 
 Management has assessed our plan to mitigate the conditions that give rise to substantial doubt and, considering the pending sale of our OWN segment and DAS business unit, management believes such plan is probable and will alleviate substantial doubt about our ability to operate as a going concern. 
 We may be required to obtain additional financing in the future to address our liquidity needs, and, subject to market conditions, we may from time to time seek to amend, refinance, restructure, exchange or repurchase our outstanding indebtedness and/or raise additional equity or other financing. Any debt we incur in the future may have terms (including cash interest rate, financial covenants and covenants limiting our operating flexibility or ability to obtain additional financings) that are not favorable to us, and any such additional equity financing may dilute the economic and/or voting interests of our existing stockholders, may be preferred in right of payment to our outstanding common stock or confer other privileges to the holders and may contain financial or operational covenants that restrict our operating flexibility or ability to obtain additional financings. Furthermore, our failure to obtain any necessary financing, amendment, refinancing, restructuring, exchange or repurchases could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and liquidity. 
 40 

We may experience volatility in cash flows between periods due to, among other reasons, variability in the timing of vendor payments and customer receipts. We may, from time to time, seek to obtain alternative sources of financing, by borrowing additional amounts under our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (Revolving Credit Facility), issuing debt or equity securities or incurring other indebtedness, if market conditions are favorable, utilizing trade credit, selling assets (including businesses or business lines) or securitizing receivables to meet future cash needs or to reduce our borrowing costs. Any issuance of equity or debt may be for cash or in exchange for our outstanding securities or indebtedness, or a combination thereof. 
 Our outstanding debt securities and debt under our credit facilities are currently trading at discounts to their respective principal amounts. In order to reduce future cash interest payments, as well as future amounts due at maturity or upon redemption, we may, from time to time, purchase such debt for cash, in exchange for common or preferred stock or debt, or for a combination thereof, in each case in open-market purchases and/or privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or exchange offers and upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine. Any such transactions will be dependent upon several factors, including our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, general market conditions and applicable regulatory, legal and accounting factors. Whether or not we engage in any such transactions will be determined at our discretion. The amounts involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. 
 Although there are no financial maintenance covenants under the terms of our senior notes, there is a limitation, among other limitations, on certain future borrowings based on an adjusted leverage ratio or a fixed charge coverage ratio. These ratios are based on financial measures similar to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA as presented in the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures section below, but also give pro forma effect to certain events, including acquisitions, synergies and savings from cost reduction initiatives such as facility closures and headcount reductions. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2024, our non-GAAP pro forma adjusted EBITDA, as measured pursuant to the indentures governing our notes, was 615.0 million, which included annualized savings expected from cost reduction initiatives of 18.6 million so that the impact of cost reduction initiatives is fully reflected in the twelve-month period used in the calculation of the ratios. In addition to limitations under these indentures, our senior secured credit facilities contain customary negative covenants based on similar financial measures. We believe we are in compliance with the covenants under our indentures and senior secured credit facilities as of September 30, 2024. 
 Cash and cash equivalents decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily driven by 45.1 million of cash paid related to the Casa Transaction, debt repayments of 24.0 million and capital expenditures of 18.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 57 of our cash and cash equivalents were held outside the U.S. 
 Working capital, net of assets and liabilities held for sale and excluding cash and cash equivalents and the current portion of long-term debt, increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily due to higher accounts receivable with favorable operating performance driving higher net sales in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, higher prepaid assets, and lower accrued liabilities due to interest payments. The increase was partially offset by higher accounts payable due to timing of payments and lower inventory. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold accounts receivable under customer-sponsored supplier financing agreements. This had an impact of approximately 95 million on working capital, excluding cash and cash equivalents and the current portion of long-term debt, as of September 30, 2024. Under these agreements, we are able to sell certain accounts receivable to a bank, and we retain no interest in and have no servicing responsibilities for the accounts receivable sold. The net reduction in total capitalization during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflected the net loss for the period.

Cash used in investing activities in the current year period was favorably impacted by proceeds of 8.6 million on the sale of certain nonfinancial assets.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid the quarterly scheduled amortization payment of 24.0 million on the 2026 Term Loan. We did not borrow under our Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and the remaining availability was 567.9 million, reflecting a borrowing base subject to maximum capacity of 636.4 million reduced by 68.5 million of letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased 81.4 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.25 senior notes due 2027, 4.3 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.125 senior notes due 2028 and 25.4 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes, for total cash consideration paid of 92.1 million. We also paid three quarterly scheduled amortization payments totaling 24.0 million on the 2026 Term Loan during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, employees surrendered shares of our common stock to satisfy their tax withholding requirements on vested restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance share units (PSUs), which reduced cash flows by 1.8 million compared to 8.9 million in the prior year period.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures 
 We believe that presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures enhances an investor s understanding of our financial performance. We further believe that these financial measures are useful in assessing our operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our recurring business. We also use certain of these financial measures for business planning purposes and in measuring our performance relative to that of our competitors. 
 We believe these financial measures are commonly used by investors to evaluate our performance and that of our competitors. However, our use of the term non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA may vary from that of others in our industry. These financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to operating income (loss), net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP as measures of operating performance, operating cash flows or liquidity. 
 We also believe presenting these non-GAAP results for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024 provides an additional tool for assessing our recent performance. Such amounts are unaudited and are derived by subtracting the data for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 from the data for the year ended December 31, 2023 and then adding the data for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Although there are no financial maintenance covenants under the terms of our senior notes, there is a limitation, among other limitations, on certain future borrowings based on an adjusted leverage ratio or a fixed charge coverage ratio. These ratios are based on financial measures similar to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA as presented in this section, but also give pro forma effect to certain events, including acquisitions and savings from cost reduction initiatives such as facility closures and headcount reductions.

 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes certain statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance.

our substantial indebtedness, including our upcoming maturities and evaluation of capital structure alternatives and restrictive debt covenants; our ability to refinance existing indebtedness prior to its maturity or incur additional indebtedness at acceptable interest rates or at all; our ability to generate cash to service our indebtedness; the divestiture of the Home segment and its effect on our remaining businesses; the expected timing of the closing of the sale of the OWN and DAS businesses (the Transaction); the expected benefits of the Transaction, including the expected financial performance of CommScope following the Transaction; the ability of the parties to obtain any required regulatory approvals in connection with the Transaction and to complete the Transaction considering the various closing conditions; expenses related to the Transaction and any potential future costs; the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the definitive agreement governing the Transaction, or an inability to consummate the Transaction on the terms described or at all;

the response of CommScope s competitors, creditors and other stakeholders to the Transaction; risks associated with the disruption of management s attention from ongoing business operations due to the Transaction; the ability to meet expectations regarding the timing and completion of the Transaction; potential litigation relating to the Transaction; restrictions during the pendency of the Transaction that may impact the ability to pursue certain business opportunities, including uncertainty regarding the timing of the separation, achievement of the expected benefits and the potential disruption to the business; our ability to integrate and fully realize anticipated benefits from prior or future divestitures, acquisitions or equity investments; possible future additional impairment charges for fixed or intangible assets, including goodwill; our ability to attract and retain qualified key employees; labor unrest; product quality or performance issues, including those associated with our suppliers or contract manufacturers, and associated warranty claims; our ability to maintain effective management information technology systems and to successfully implement major systems initiatives; cyber-security incidents, including data security breaches, ransomware or computer viruses; the use of open standards; the long-term impact of climate change; significant international operations exposing us to economic risks like variability in foreign exchange rates and inflation, as well as political and other risks, including the impact of wars, regional conflicts and terrorism; our ability to comply with governmental anti-corruption laws and regulations worldwide; the impact of export and import controls and sanctions worldwide on our supply chain and ability to compete in international markets;

the costs of protecting or defending intellectual property; costs and challenges of compliance with domestic and foreign social and environmental laws; the impact of litigation and similar regulatory proceedings in which we are involved or may become involved, including the costs of such litigation; the scope, duration and impact of disease outbreaks and pandemics, such as COVID-19, on our business, including employees, sites, operations, customers, supply chain logistics and the global economy; our stock price volatility; income tax rate variability and ability to recover amounts recorded as deferred tax assets; and other factors beyond our control.

These and other factors are discussed in greater detail in our 2023 Annual Report and may be updated from time to time in our annual reports, quarterly reports, current reports and other filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although the information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q represents our best judgment as of the date of this report based on information currently available and reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained or that any deviation will not be material. Given these uncertainties, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. We are not undertaking any duty or obligation to update this information to reflect developments or information obtained after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, except to the extent required by law. 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 There have been no material changes in the interest rate risk, commodity price risk or foreign currency exchange rate risk information previously reported under Item 7A of our 2023 Annual Report, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 29, 2024. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Reference should be made to our 2023 Annual Report for additional information regarding discussion of the effectiveness of the Company s controls and procedures.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1. LEGA L PROCEEDINGS 
 The Company is a party to certain intellectual property claims and also periodically receives notices asserting that its products infringe on another party s patents and other intellectual property rights. These claims and assertions, whether against the Company directly or against its customers, could require the Company to pay damages or royalties, stop offering the relevant products and/or cease other activities. The Company may also be called upon to indemnify certain customers for costs related to products sold to such customers. The outcome of these claims and notices is uncertain, and a reasonable estimate of the loss from unfavorable outcomes in certain of these matters either cannot be determined or is estimated at the minimum amount of a range of estimates. The actual loss, through settlement or trial, could be material and may vary significantly from the Company s estimates. From time to time, the Company may also be involved as a plaintiff in certain intellectual property claims. Gain contingencies, if any, are recognized when they are realized. 
 The Company is also either a plaintiff or a defendant in certain other pending legal matters in the normal course of business. Management believes none of these other pending legal matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company s business or financial condition upon final disposition. 
 In addition, the Company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing the use, discharge, disposal and remediation of hazardous materials. Compliance with current laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition or results of operations. 
 ITEM 1A. R ISK FACTORS 
 The Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks which could cause actual results to vary from recent results or from anticipated future results. There have been no material changes to our risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of our 2023 Annual Report.
