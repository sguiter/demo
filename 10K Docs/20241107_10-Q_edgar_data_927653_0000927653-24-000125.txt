 Reported income tax rate 
 Fluctuations in the Company s reported income tax rates were primarily due to non-cash charges related to remeasuring the value of its Canadian retail disposal group held for sale to fair value less costs to sell, changes in the mix of earnings between various taxing jurisdictions and discrete items recognized in the quarters. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold certain intellectual property between McKesson wholly-owned legal entities based in foreign tax jurisdictions. The transferor entity of the intellectual property was not subject to income tax on this transaction. The recipient entity of the intellectual property is entitled to amortize the fair value of the assets for tax purposes. As a result, a discrete tax benefit of million was recognized in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded non-cash pre-tax charges of million to remeasure the Canadian retail disposal group to fair value less costs to sell, as described in Financial Note 2, Held for Sale . The Company s reported income tax rates for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 were unfavorably impacted by these charges given that no net tax benefit was recognized for these charges. 
 During the six months ended September 30, 2024, the Company also recognized discrete tax benefits of million related to an election to change the tax status of a foreign affiliate, million related to the tax impact of share-based compensation, and million related to the reduction in unrecognized tax benefits due to a change in case law, partially offset by a discrete tax expense of million related to interest expense accrued on unrecognized tax benefits.

 million primarily related to interest expense accrued on unrecognized tax benefits. During the six months ended September 30, 2023, the Company repatriated certain intellectual property between McKesson wholly-owned legal entities that are based in different tax jurisdictions. The transferor entity of the intellectual property was not subject to income tax on this transaction. The recipient entity of the intellectual property is entitled to amortize the fair value of the assets for tax purposes. As a result of this repatriation, and in accordance with ASU 2016-16, Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, a net discrete tax benefit of million was recognized during the three months ended June 30, 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had billion of unrecognized tax benefits, of which billion would reduce income tax expense and the effective tax rate if recognized. During the next twelve months, the Company does not anticipate any material reduction in its unrecognized tax benefits based on the information currently available. However, this may change as the Company continues to have ongoing discussions with various taxing authorities throughout the year.

 I. Litigation and Claims Involving Distribution of Controlled Substances 
 The Company and its affiliates have been sued as defendants in many cases asserting claims related to distribution of controlled substances. They have been named as defendants along with other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and retail pharmacies. The plaintiffs in these actions have included state attorneys general, county and municipal governments, school districts, tribal nations, hospitals, health and welfare funds, third-party payors, and individuals. These actions have been filed in state and federal courts throughout the U.S., and in Puerto Rico and Canada. These plaintiffs have sought monetary damages and other forms of relief based on a variety of causes of action, including negligence, public nuisance, unjust enrichment, and civil conspiracy, as well as alleging violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act RICO ), state and federal controlled substances laws, and other statutes. Because of the many uncertainties associated with opioid-related litigation matters, the Company is not able to conclude that a liability is probable or provide a reasonable estimate for the range of ultimate possible loss for opioid-related litigation matters other than those for which an accrual is described below. 
 State and Local Government Claims 
 The Company and other national pharmaceutical distributors (collectively Distributors entered into a settlement agreement (the Settlement and consent judgment with states and their participating subdivisions, as well as the District of Columbia and all eligible territories (the Settling Governmental Entities ). Approximately cases have been dismissed. The Distributors did not admit liability or wrongdoing and do not waive any defenses pursuant to the Settlement. Under the Settlement, the Company has paid the Settling Governmental Entities approximately billion as of September 30, 2024, and additionally will pay the Settling Governmental Entities up to approximately billion through 2038. A minimum of of the Settlement payments must be used by state and local governmental entities to remediate the opioid epidemic, while the remainder relates to plaintiffs attorneys fees and costs and will be paid out through 2030. Pursuant to the Settlement, the Distributors are in the process of establishing a clearinghouse to consolidate their controlled-substance distribution data, which will be available to the settling U.S. states to use as part of their anti-diversion efforts.

 million as of September 30, 2024, and additionally will pay approximately million through 2031. The Company previously settled with the state of West Virginia in 2018, so West Virginia and its subdivisions were not eligible to participate in the Settlement. Under a separate settlement agreement, the Company has paid certain West Virginia subdivisions approximately million as of September 30, 2024, and additionally will pay approximately million through 2033. That agreement does not include school districts or the claims of Cabell County and the City of Huntington. After a trial, the claims of Cabell County and the City of Huntington, were decided in the Company s favor on July 4, 2022. Those subdivisions appealed that decision. 
 Some other state and local governmental subdivisions did not participate in the Settlement, including certain municipal governments, government hospitals, school districts, and government-affiliated third-party payors. The Company contends that those subdivisions claims are foreclosed by the Settlement or other dispositive defenses, but the subdivisions contend that their claims are not foreclosed. 
 The City of Baltimore, Maryland, is such subdivision. A trial of its claims against the Company and another national pharmaceutical distributor began on September 16, 2024 in the Circuit Court of Maryland for Baltimore City, Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Purdue Pharma LP, No. 24-C-18-000515 . Baltimore claims that the defendants distribution of controlled substances to certain pharmacies in the City of Baltimore and Baltimore County caused a public nuisance. Baltimore is seeking monetary damages and other relief. 
 The district attorneys of the City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Allegheny County, Pennsylvania did not participate in the settlement and sought to bring separate claims against the Company, notwithstanding the settlement with the state of Pennsylvania and its attorney general. On January 26, 2024, the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania ruled that the Pennsylvania attorney general had settled and fully released the claims brought by those district attorneys under Pennsylvania s Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law. The district attorneys have appealed that decision to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. An accrual for the remaining governmental subdivision claims is reflected in the total estimated liability for opioid-related claims in a manner consistent with how Settlement amounts were allocated to Settling Governmental Entities. 
 Native American Tribe Claims 
 The Company also entered into settlement agreements for opioid-related claims of federally recognized Native American tribes. Under those agreements, the Company has paid the settling Native American tribes approximately million as of September 30, 2024, and additionally will pay approximately million through 2027. A minimum of of the total settlement payments must be used by the settling Native American tribes to remediate the opioid epidemic. 
 Non-Governmental Plaintiff Claims

Poppell v. Cardinal Health, Inc., CE19-00472. On March 1, 2023, the jury in that case returned a verdict in favor of the defendants, including the Company. Plaintiffs appealed the jury verdict. On September 4, 2024, the Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed the judgment in favor of the Company. 
 The Company and other national distributors have reached proposed settlements with representatives of nationwide groups of acute care hospitals and certain third-party payors. The claims of remaining U.S. non-governmental plaintiffs are not included in the charges recorded by the Company.

 Canadian Plaintiff Claims 
 The Company and its Canadian affiliate are also defendants in opioid-related cases pending in Canada. These cases involve the claims of the provincial governments, municipal governments, a group representing indigenous people, as well as case brought by an individual. 
 Defense of Opioids Claims 
 The Company believes it has valid legal defenses in all opioid-related matters, including claims not covered by settlement agreements, and it intends to mount a vigorous defense in such matters. Other than the accruals described above, the Company has not concluded a loss is probable in any of the matters; nor is any possible loss or range of loss reasonably estimable. An adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial position, cash flows or liquidity, or results of operations.

 Trends and Uncertainties: 
 Opioid-Related Litigation and Claims 
 As described in the discussion of opioid-related matters in Financial Note 10 , Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the condensed consolidated financial statements accompanying this Quarterly Report, we are a defendant in many legal proceedings asserting claims related to the distribution of controlled substances (opioids) in federal and state courts throughout the U.S., and in Puerto Rico and Canada. The plaintiffs in these actions have included state attorneys general, county and municipal governments, tribal nations, hospitals, health and welfare funds, third-party payors, and individuals. We believe we have valid legal defenses in all opioid-related matters, including claims not covered by settlement agreements, and we intend to mount a vigorous defense. Other than as to the settlements described in Financial Note 1 0 , we have not concluded a loss is probable in any of the matters; nor is any possible loss or range of loss reasonably estimable. An adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, cash flows or liquidity, or results of operations. 
 The Company and two other national distributors have reached proposed settlements with representatives of nationwide groups of acute care hospitals and certain third-party payors. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we made payments totaling 500 million associated with various settlement agreements for opioid-related claims of states, subdivisions, and Native American tribes. Our total estimated liability for opioid-related claims was 6.4 billion as of September 30, 2024, of which 775 million was included within Other accrued liabilities for the amount estimated to be paid within the next twelve months, and the remaining liability was included in Long-term litigation liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 Rite Aid Bankruptcy Proceedings 
 In October 2023, our customer Rite Aid Corporation (including certain of its subsidiaries, Rite Aid filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Consequently, we recorded a provision for bad debts totaling 725 million during the year ended March 31, 2024, of which 210 million was recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 representing the uncollected trade accounts receivable balance from Rite Aid as of September 30, 2023. 
 Rite Aid's restructuring plan was approved by the court and the company successfully emerged from bankruptcy in August 2024. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, we reassessed our initial estimates made in conjunction with the previously reserved prepetition balances, including cash received during the period, resulting in a reversal of 203 million recorded within Selling, distribution, general, and administrative expenses in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and included in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, we released 237 million of allowance for doubtful accounts against trade accounts receivables, representing the write-off of uncollectible receivables related to the Rite Aid provision in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 We believe the reserves maintained and expenses and credits recorded in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 for Rite Aid trade accounts receivable are appropriate and consistent with our accounting policy and assessment of the information currently available. We evaluate our reserves periodically and as circumstances warrant which may result in changes to our reserves. For additional disclosure of our policy regarding allowances for credit losses, refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates section within Item 7 - Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II of our 2024 Annual Report.

 Revenues 
 Revenues increased for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same prior year periods, primarily due to market growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, including higher volumes largely from retail national account customers and growth in specialty pharmaceuticals. Market growth includes growing drug utilization and newly launched products, partially offset by price deflation associated with branded to generic drug conversion. This revenue growth was also favorably impacted by higher pharmaceutical distribution volumes in our International segment. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit increased for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same prior year periods primarily in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment driven by growth of specialty pharmaceuticals and in our International segment driven by higher volumes. 
 We recognized gains of 63 million and 79 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 153 million and 197 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to our share of antitrust legal settlements. We recognized these amounts within "Cost of sales" in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations within our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment.

 Gross profit for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 was impacted by restructuring charges of 63 million related to a broad set of initiatives to drive operational efficiencies and increase cost optimization efforts as discussed in Financial Note 3, Restructuring, Impairment, and Related Charges, Net, to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report. We recorded this amount related to impairment of inventories within "Cost of sales" in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations within our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. 
 A last-in, first out LIFO credit of 2 million and a charge of 55 million were recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and a credit of 4 million and a charge of 87 million were recognized during the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily due to lower expected brand inflation in the current fiscal year. 
 Our U.S. Pharmaceutical business uses the LIFO method of accounting for the majority of its inventories, which results in cost of sales that more closely reflects replacement cost than under other accounting methods. The business practice is to pass on to customers published price changes from suppliers. Manufacturers generally provide us with price protection, which limits price related inventory losses. A LIFO charge is recognized when the net effect of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. A LIFO credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines exceeds the impact of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory. Our quarterly LIFO adjustment is based on our estimates of the annual LIFO adjustment which is impacted by expected changes in year-end inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be influenced by market and other external factors. Changes to any of the above factors could have a material impact to our annual LIFO adjustment. The actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method is calculated at the end of the fiscal year. 
 Total Operating Expenses 
 A summary of the components of our total operating expenses for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows: 
 Selling, distribution, general, and administrative expenses SDG A ): SDG A consists of personnel costs, transportation costs, depreciation and amortization, lease costs, professional fee expenses, administrative expenses, provision for bad debts and related recoveries, remeasurement charges to fair value less costs to sell, and other general charges.

 FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED) 
 (UNAUDITED) 

 For the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, total operating expenses and total operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased compared to the same prior year periods. Total operating expenses were impacted by the following significant items: 
 SDG A for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 includes charges of 643 million to remeasure our Canadian retail disposal group to fair value less costs to sell. The remeasurement adjustment includes a 15 million loss related to the accumulated other comprehensive loss balances associated with this disposal. Of the total charges recorded during the period, 593 million are included within our International segment and 50 million are included within Corporate expenses, net; 
 SDG A for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 includes a credit of 203 million, and for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 includes a provision for bad debts of 210 million, related to the bankruptcy of Rite Aid in October 2023. Refer to the Rite Aid Bankruptcy Proceedings section of Trends and Uncertainties for additional information; 
 SDG A increased compared to the same prior year periods due to increased operating expenses to support higher volumes and gains of 48 million and 76 million recognized in the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, resulting from a fair value adjustment of our contingent consideration liability related to the Rx Savings Solutions, LLC acquisition; 
 Claims and litigation charges, net primarily consists of a charge of 108 million related to our estimated liability for opioid-related claims as previously discussed in the Opioid-Related Litigation and Claims section of Trends and Uncertainties ; and 
 Restructuring, impairment, and related charges, net were 171 million and 28 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 181 million and 80 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as discussed below under Restructuring Initiatives. 
 Goodwill Impairment 
 We evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in the first fiscal quarter, and at an interim date if indicators of potential impairment exist. The annual impairment testing performed in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 did not indicate any impairment of goodwill, and no goodwill impairment charges were recorded during the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. However, other risks, expenses, and future developments, such as government actions, increased regulatory uncertainty, and material changes in key market assumptions limit our ability to estimate projected cash flows, which could adversely affect the fair value of various reporting units in future periods. 
 Restructuring Initiatives 
 We recorded restructuring, impairment, and related charges of 171 million and 28 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 181 million and 80 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These charges were included in Restructuring, impairment, and related charges, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 During the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we approved enterprise-wide initiatives to modernize and accelerate our technology service operating model, which are intended to improve business continuity, compliance, operating efficiency and advance investments to streamline the organization. These initiatives will also include cost reduction efforts and support other rationalization efforts within Corporate, and the Medical-Surgical Solutions, and U.S. Pharmaceutical segments to help realize long-term sustainable growth. We anticipate total charges related to these initiatives of 650 million to 700 million, consisting primarily of employee severance and other employee-related costs as well as facility, exit and other related costs, including long-lived asset impairments. These programs are anticipated to be substantially complete in fiscal 2028. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded charges of 227 million related to the initiatives, which primarily includes severance and other employee-related costs as well as facility exit and other related costs, including long-lived asset impairments and a 63 million related to inventory impairments recorded within Cost of sales in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we approved a broad set of initiatives to drive operational efficiencies and increase cost optimization efforts, with the intent of simplifying our infrastructure and realizing long-term sustainable growth. These initiatives included headcount reductions, primarily consisting of employee severance and other employee-related costs within our RxTS segment, and the exit or downsizing of certain facilities. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded charges of 3 million and 39 million related to this program, respectively, which primarily included real estate and other related asset impairments and facility costs within Corporate. This restructuring program was substantially complete in fiscal 2024. 
 Refer to Financial Note 3 , Restructuring, Impairment, and Related Charges, Net, to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for further information on our restructuring initiatives. 
 Other Income, Net 
 Other income, net increased for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same prior year periods primarily due to a favorable impact from interest income. Other income, net for the six months ended September 30, 2024 includes a net gain of 95 million related to our investments in equity securities of certain U.S. growth stage companies in the healthcare industry, partially offset by a loss of 43 million related to one of our equity method investments. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense increased for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same prior year periods primarily due to increased average balances of the Company s loan portfolio throughout the first half of the year. Interest expense for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was unfavorably impacted by a prior year gain on debt extinguishment of 9 million. Interest expense may fluctuate based on timing, amounts, and interest rates of term debt repaid and new term debt issued, as well as amounts incurred associated with financing fees. Refer to Financial Note 7 , Debt and Financing Activities, to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for more information.

 Income Tax Expense 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded income tax expense of 247 million and 213 million, respectively. For the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded income tax expense of 371 million and 307 million, respectively. Our reported income tax rates were 46.3 and 23.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 22.9 and 15.3 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Fluctuations in our reported income tax rates are primarily due to non-cash charges related to the remeasurement of our Canadian retail disposal group held for sale to fair value less costs to sell, changes in our business mix of earnings between various taxing jurisdictions and discrete tax items recognized in the quarters. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold certain intellectual property between McKesson wholly-owned legal entities based in foreign tax jurisdictions. The transferor entity of the intellectual property was not subject to income tax on this transaction whereas the recipient entity of the intellectual property is entitled to amortize the fair value of the assets for tax purposes. As a result, a discrete tax benefit of 44 million was recognized in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded non-cash pre-tax charges of 643 million primarily to remeasure our Canadian retail disposal group to fair value less costs to sell, as described in Financial Note 2, Held for Sale . Our reported income tax rates for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 were unfavorably impacted by these charges as no net tax benefit was recognized for these charges. 
 For the six months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized discrete tax benefits of 58 million related to an election to change the tax status of a foreign affiliate, 38 million related to the tax impact of share-based compensation, and 47 million related to the reduction in unrecognized tax benefits due to a change in case law, partially offset by a discrete tax expense of 37 million related to interest expense accrued on unrecognized tax benefits. 
 We recognized a net discrete tax benefit of 147 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023 primarily related to the repatriation of certain intellectual property between McKesson wholly-owned legal entities that are based in different tax jurisdictions. Refer to Financial Note 4 , Income Taxes, to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for more information. 
 Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 primarily represents the proportionate results of third-party equity interests in ClarusONE Sourcing Services LLP, Vantage Oncology Holdings, LLC, and SCRI Oncology, LLC. The increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was primarily driven by higher volumes in our ClarusONE joint venture. 
 Net Income Attributable to McKesson Corporation 
 Net income attributable to McKesson Corporation was 241 million and 664 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 1.2 billion and 1.6 billion for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Diluted earnings per common share attributable to McKesson Corporation was 1.87 and 4.92 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 8.89 and 11.95 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our diluted earnings per share includes the cumulative effects of share repurchases during each period. 
 Weighted-Average Diluted Common Shares Outstanding 
 Diluted earnings per common share was calculated based on a weighted-average number of shares outstanding of 129.3 million and 134.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 130.0 million and 135.7 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 decreased from the same prior year periods primarily due to the cumulative effect of share repurchases, as discussed in the S hare Repurchases P lans section of this Financial Review.

 FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 We expect our available cash generated from operations and our short-term investment portfolio, together with our existing sources of liquidity from our credit facilities, commercial paper program, and other borrowings will be sufficient to fund our short-term and long-term capital expenditures, working capital, and other cash requirements. We remain adequately capitalized, including access to liquidity from our 4.0 billion revolving credit facility. At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all debt covenants, and believe we have the ability to continue to meet our debt covenants in the future. 
 The following table summarizes the net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash for the periods shown: 
 Six Months Ended September 30, (Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 Change Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 720 (87) 807 Investing activities (373) (315) (58) Financing activities (2,408) (1,752) (656) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 1 (1) 2 Change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash classified as Assets held for sale (14) (14) Net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (2,074) (2,155) 81 
 
 Operating Activities 
 Operating activities provided cash of 720 million and used cash of 87 million during the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash flows from operations can be significantly impacted by factors such as the timing of receipts from customers, inventory receipts, and payments to vendors. Additionally, working capital is primarily a function of sales and purchase volumes, inventory requirements, and vendor payment terms. 
 Operating activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 were affected by net income of 1.2 billion, adjusted for non-cash items, including charges of 643 million to remeasure the assets and liabilities of our Canadian retail disposal group to fair value less cost to sell, as well as increases in accounts payable of 6.2 billion, receivables of 3.5 billion, and inventories of 3.3 billion, all primarily driven by higher revenues and timing. Our litigation liabilities decreased by 386 million due to payments made in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 associated with various settlement agreements for opioid-related claims of states, subdivisions, and Native American tribes, partially offset by an accrual in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 related to a proposed settlement with third party payors as discussed in Financial Note 10, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report.

 Financing Activities 
 Financing activities used cash of 2.4 billion and 1.8 billion during the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. On September 10, 2024, we completed a public offering of 4.25 Notes due September 15, 2029 in a principal amount of 500 million. Proceeds received from this note issuance, net of discounts and offering expenses, were approximately 496 million. We utilized the net proceeds from this note issuance along with cash on hand to redeem our 500 million outstanding principal amount of 5.25 Notes due February 15, 2026 prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest through the settlement date. 
 On June 15, 2023, we completed a public offering of 4.90 Notes due July 15, 2028 in a principal amount of 400 million and 5.10 Notes due July 15, 2033 in a principal amount of 600 million, for proceeds received, net of discounts and offering expenses, of 397 million and 592 million, respectively. A portion of the net proceeds from these notes was utilized to fund the repurchase of our then outstanding 3.80 Notes due March 15, 2024 (the 2024 Notes discussed below, while the remaining net proceeds was available for general corporate purposes. 
 On June 16, 2023, we completed a cash tender offer for any and all of our then outstanding 2024 Notes with a principal amount of 918 million, which was made concurrently with the June 15, 2023 notes offering described above. Using a portion of the proceeds from the June 15, 2023 notes offering, we paid an aggregate consideration of 268 million to repurchase 271 million principal amount of the 2024 Notes. Following the consummation of this tender offer, on June 16, 2023, we irrevocably deposited U.S. government obligations with the trustee under the indenture governing the 2024 Notes sufficient to fund the payment of accrued and unpaid interest of the remaining 647 million principal amount of the 2024 Notes as it became due, and of the principal amount of those 2024 Notes on their March 15, 2024 maturity date. 
 Financing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 includes 2.0 billion and 1.5 billion of cash paid for share repurchases, as well as 162 million and 149 million of cash paid for dividends, respectively. Financing activities also includes cash receipts and cash repayments each of 6.9 billion and 2.0 billion for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to short-term borrowings of commercial paper. 
 Cash used for other financing activities generally includes the cash value of shares surrendered for tax withholding and payments to noncontrolling interests. 
 
 Share Repurchase Plans 
 The Board has authorized the repurchase of common stock. We may repurchase common stock from time-to-time through open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase programs, or by combinations of such methods, any of which may use pre-arranged trading plans that are designed to meet the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act ). The timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, tax implications, restrictions under our debt obligations, other uses for capital, impacts on the value of remaining shares, cash generated from operations, and market and economic conditions. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 2.9 million shares of common stock for 1.5 billion through open market transactions at an average price per share of 533.46, of which 22 million was accrued within Other accrued liabilities in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets for share repurchases that were executed in late September 2024 and settled in early October 2024. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we repurchased 1.0 million shares of common stock for 528 million through open market transactions at an average price per share of 548.20. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased 2.0 million shares of common stock for 840 million through open market transactions at an average price per share of 422.39, of which 23 million was accrued within Other accrued liabilities in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets for share repurchases that were executed in late September 2023 and settled in early October 2023. During the three months ended June 30, 2023, we repurchased 1.8 million shares of common stock for 673 million through open market transactions at an average price per share of 379.14.

 Effective January 1, 2023, our repurchase of common stock, adjusted for allowable items, are subject to a 1 excise tax as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Excise taxes incurred on share repurchases of an entity s own common stock are direct and incremental costs to purchase treasury stock, and accordingly are included in the total cost basis of the common stock acquired and reflected as a reduction of stockholders equity within Treasury shares in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Deficit. Excise taxes do not reduce our remaining authorization for the repurchase of common stock. Excise taxes of 15 million and 8 million were incurred and accrued for shares repurchased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Excise taxes of 16 million and 12 million were incurred and accrued for shares repurchased during the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the amounts accrued for excise taxes were 41 million and 25 million, respectively, within Other accrued liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 In July 2024, the Board approved an increase of 4.0 billion in the authorization for the repurchase of common stock. The total remaining authorization outstanding for repurchases of common stock at September 30, 2024 was 8.6 billion. 
 
 Selected Measures of Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 (Dollars in millions) September 30, 2024 March 31, 2024 Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 2,511 4,585 Working capital (5,430) (4,387) Debt to capital ratio (1) 
 158.8 124.0 
 (1) This ratio describes the relationship and changes within our capital resources, and is computed as the sum of total debt divided by the sum of total debt and McKesson stockholders deficit, which excludes noncontrolling interests and accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
 Cash equivalents, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are carried at fair value. Cash equivalents are primarily invested in AAA-rated U.S. government money market funds, short-term deposits with financial institutions, and short-term commercial papers issued by non-financial institutions. Deposits with financial institutions are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries, including Canadian dollars. Deposits could exceed the amounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in the U.S. and similar deposit insurance programs in other jurisdictions. We mitigate the risk of our short-term investment portfolio by depositing funds with reputable financial institutions and monitoring risk profiles and investment strategies of money market funds. 
 Our cash and cash equivalents balance as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024 included approximately 1.7 billion and 1.6 billion, respectively, of cash held by our subsidiaries outside of the U.S. Our primary intent is to utilize this cash for foreign operations for an indefinite period of time. Although the majority of cash held outside the U.S. is available for repatriation, doing so could subject us to foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes. We may remit foreign earnings to the U.S. to the extent it is tax efficient to do so. We do not anticipate the tax impact from remitting these earnings to be material. Following enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the repatriation of cash to the U.S. is generally no longer taxable for federal income tax purposes. 
 Working capital primarily includes cash and cash equivalents, receivables, inventories, and prepaid expenses, net of drafts and accounts payable, short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt, current portion of operating lease liabilities, and other accrued liabilities. Working capital also includes net assets and liabilities classified as held for sale which have increased in fiscal 2025 as a result of the expected divestiture of our Canadian retail disposal group. Our businesses require substantial investments in working capital that are susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands. Inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity and other requirements. 
 Consolidated working capital decreased at September 30, 2024 compared to March 31, 2024 primarily due to an increase in drafts and accounts payable from increased purchasing driven by increased sales and timing, and a decrease in cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by an increase in receivables, net and inventories, net, driven by higher sales and timing, an increase in net current assets held for sale related to our Canadian retail disposal group, and a decrease in other accrued liabilities. 
 Our debt to capital ratio increased for the six months ended September 30, 2024 due to share repurchases and dividend payments, partially offset by net income attributable to McKesson for fiscal 2025.

 FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONCLUDED) 
 (UNAUDITED) 

 In July 2024, we raised our quarterly dividend from 0.62 to 0.71 per share of common stock for dividends declared on or after such date by the Board. We anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Board and will depend upon our future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, legal requirements, and other factors. 
 Capital Resources 
 We fund our working capital requirements primarily with cash and cash equivalents, proceeds from short-term borrowings from our commercial paper issuances, and longer-term credit agreements and debt offerings. Funds necessary for future debt maturities and our other cash requirements, including any future payments that may be made related to our total estimated litigation liability of 6.4 billion as of September 30, 2024 payable under the terms of various settlement agreements for opioid-related claims, are expected to be met by existing cash balances, cash flow from operations, existing credit sources, and future borrowings. Long-term debt markets and commercial paper markets, our primary sources of capital after cash flow from operations, are open and accessible to us should we decide to access those markets. Detailed information regarding our debt and financing activities is included in Financial Note 7 , Debt and Financing Activities, to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report. 
 We believe that our future operating cash flow, financial assets, and access to capital and credit markets, including our credit facilities, give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that an increase in volatility or disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing.

In such event, each Lender s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L C Borrowing and shall constitute an L C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.03 . 
 2.3.1.3.4. Until each Lender funds its Committed Loan or L C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) to reimburse the L C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender s Pro Rata Share of such amount shall be solely for the account of the L C Issuer. 
 2.3.1.3.5. Each Lender s obligation to make Committed Loans or L C Advances to reimburse the L C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this 2.03(c) , shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the L C Issuer, the applicable Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing provided, however , that each Lender s obligation to make Committed Loans pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.03 (other than delivery by the applicable Borrower of a Committed Loan Notice). No such making of an L C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the applicable Borrower to reimburse the L C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by the L C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein. 
 2.3.1.3.6. If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03(c) by the time specified in Section 2.03(c)(ii) , the L C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the L C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the L C Issuer in connection with the foregoing. A certificate of the L C Issuer submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
 2.3.1.4. Repayment of Participations . 
 2.3.1.4.1. At any time after the L C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Lender such Lender s L C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.03(c) , if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of the L C Issuer any payment in respect of 
 4 

the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the applicable Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender s L C Advance was outstanding) in Dollars and in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent. 
 2.3.1.4.2. If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the L C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 11.05 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the L C Issuer in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L C Issuer its Pro Rata Share thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. 
 2.3.1.5. Obligations Absolute . The obligation of the applicable Borrower to reimburse the L C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to repay each L C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following 
 2.3.1.5.1. any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other Loan Document 
 2.3.1.5.2. the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that the applicable Borrower or any Subsidiary may have at any time against any Beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such Beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the L C Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction 
 2.3.1.5.3. any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit 
 2.3.1.5.4. any payment by the L C Issuer under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or any payment made by the L C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any Beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law 
 2.3.1.5.5. any adverse change in the relevant exchange rates or in the availability of the relevant Alternative Currency to the Company or any Subsidiary or in the relevant currency markets generally or 
 2.3.1.5.6. any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the applicable Borrower or any Subsidiary. 
 The applicable Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with the Company s instructions or other irregularity, the Company will immediately notify the L C Issuer. Each Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the L C Issuer and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid. 
 5 

2.3.1.6. Role of L C Issuer . Each Lender and each Borrower agrees that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the L C Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the L C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the L C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document. Each Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any Beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit provided, however , that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the applicable Borrower s pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the Beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the L C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the L C Issuer shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (vi) of Section 2.03(e) provided , however , that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the applicable Borrower may have a claim against the L C Issuer, and the L C Issuer may be liable to such Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by such Borrower which such Borrower proves were caused by, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment, the L C Issuer s willful misconduct or gross negligence or the L C Issuer s willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the Beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the L C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and the L C Issuer shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason. 
 2.3.1.7. Cash Collateral . Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, (i) if the L C Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L C Borrowing or (ii) if, as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any L C Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, the applicable Borrowers shall, in each case, immediately Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all L C Obligations. Sections 2.03(a)(ii)(F) , 2.05, 2.18(a)(v) and 8.02(c) set forth certain additional requirements to deliver Cash Collateral hereunder. For purposes of this Sections 2.03 , 2.05 , 2.18(a)(v) and Section 8.02(c) , Cash Collateralize means to pledge and deposit with or deliver to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L C Issuer and the Lenders, as collateral for the L C Obligations, as applicable, cash or deposit account balances pursuant to documentation in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the L C Issuer (which documents are hereby consented to by the Lenders). Derivatives of such term have corresponding meanings. Each Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the L C Issuer and the Lenders, a security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein and all proceeds of the foregoing. Cash Collateral shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts at Bank of America. For purposes of this Section 2.03 , Cash Collateral means the cash and deposit account balances pledged and deposited with or delivered to the Agent, pursuant to a requirement to Cash Collateralize the L C Obligations. Additionally, if the Administrative Agent notifies the Company at any time that the Outstanding Amount of all L C Obligations at such time exceeds the Letter of Credit Sublimit then in effect, then, within two Business Days after receipt of such notice, the Company shall provide Cash Collateral for the Outstanding Amount of the L C Obligations in an amount not less than the amount by which the Outstanding Amount of all L C Obligations exceeds the Letter of Credit Sublimit. 
 2.3.1.8. Applicability of ISP and UCP . Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the L C Issuer and the applicable Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued (including any such agreement applicable to an Existing Letter of Credit), (i) the rules of the ISP, with the exception of Rule 5.09 thereof, shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit, and (ii) the rules of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, as most recently published by the International Chamber of Commerce at the time of issuance shall apply to each commercial Letter of Credit.

The applicable Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Pro Rata Share a letter of credit fee for each Letter of Credit equal to the Applicable Rate times the daily maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit (whether or not such maximum amount is then in effect under such Letter of Credit). Such letter of credit fees shall be computed on a quarterly basis in arrears. Such letter of credit fees shall be due and payable on the tenth calendar day following the end of each calendar quarter, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand. If there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the daily maximum amount of each Letter of Credit shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect. 
 2.3.1.10. Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to L C Issuer . The applicable Borrower shall pay directly to the L C Issuer for its own account a fronting fee with respect to each Letter of Credit in an amount equal to 0.125 per annum times the daily maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. Such fronting fees shall be computed on a quarterly basis in arrears. Such fronting fees shall be due and payable on the first Business Day after the end of each calendar quarter, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand. For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.07 . In addition, the applicable Borrower shall pay directly to the L C Issuer for its own account the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges (including reasonable out-of-pocket expenses relating to issuances, amendments, renewals, extensions and any demands for payment), of the L C Issuer relating to letters of credit as from time to time in effect. Such customary fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable on demand and are nonrefundable.

 2.3.1.12. Letters of Credit Issued for Subsidiaries .

The Company hereby acknowledges that the issuance of Letters of Credit for the account of Subsidiaries inures to the benefit of the Company, and that the Company s business derives substantial benefits from the businesses of such Subsidiaries. 
 2.3.1.13. Reports to Administrative Agent . The L C Issuer shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, upon each calendar month end, a report setting forth for such period the daily aggregate amount available to be drawn under the Letters of Credit that were outstanding during such month.

Upon the appointment of a successor L C Issuer, (x) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the resigning L C Issuer and (y) the successor L C Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to the applicable resigning L C Issuer to effectively assume the obligations of the applicable resigning L C Issuer with respect to such Letters of Credit.

 2.9.1.1. Facility Fee . The Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Pro Rata Share, a facility fee payable in Dollars on the tenth calendar day following the end of each calendar quarter, which shall be equal to the Applicable Rate times the actual daily amount of the Aggregate Commitments (or, if the Aggregate Commitments have terminated, on the Outstanding Amount of all Committed Loans and L C Obligations), regardless of usage. The facility fee shall accrue at all times during the Availability Period (and thereafter so long as any Committed Loans or L C Obligations remain outstanding), including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in ARTICLE IV are not met, and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on each date specified above following the end of each calendar quarter, commencing with the first such date to occur after the date hereof, and on the last day of the Availability Period (and, if applicable, thereafter on demand). The facility fee shall be calculated on a calendar quarter basis in arrears, and if there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the actual daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect.

All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year) or, in the case of interest in respect of other Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies as to which market practice differs from the foregoing, in accordance with such market practice. Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.12(a) , bear interest for one day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. 
 
 2.11. Evidence of Debt . 
 2.11.1.1. The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrowers and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrowers hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Agent, the applicable Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender s Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may 
 1 

attach Schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount, currency and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto. 
 2.11.1.2. In addition to the accounts and records referred to in Section 2.11(a) , each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. 
 
 2.12. Payments Generally . 
 2.12.1.1. All payments to be made by the Borrowers shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein and except with respect to principal of and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, all payments by the Borrowers hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent s Office in Dollars and in Same Day Funds not later than 12 00 p.m. on the date specified herein. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrowers hereunder with respect to principal and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent s Office in such Alternative Currency and in Same Day Funds not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent on the dates specified herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may require that any payments due under this Agreement be made in the United States or such other address as the Administrative Agent specifies from time to time. If, for any reason, any Borrower is prohibited by any Law from making any required payment hereunder in an Alternative Currency, such Borrower shall make such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent amount of the Alternative Currency payment amount. The Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender s Lending Office. All payments received by an Agent after the applicable time specified in this Section 2.12(a) shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. If any payment to be made by a Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be. 
 2.12.1.2. (i) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to (a) the proposed date of any Borrowing of Eurocurrency Rate Loans or (b) two hours prior to the proposed time of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans that such Lender will not make available to the Agent such Lender s share of such Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Agent, then such Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the applicable Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by any Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the applicable Borrowing.

Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the applicable Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Agent for the account of the Lenders or the L C Issuers hereunder that the applicable Borrower will not make such payment, the Agent may assume that the applicable Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the L C Issuers, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the applicable Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the L C Issuers, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or L C Issuer, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Agent, at rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect.

 2.12.1.5. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.

If, other than as expressly provided elsewhere herein, any Lender shall obtain on account of the Committed Loans made by it, or the participations in L C Obligations held by it, any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other share contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Committed Loans made by them and or such subparticipations in the participations in L C Obligations held by them, as the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment in respect of such Committed Loans, or such participations, as the case may be, pro rata with each of them provided, however , that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 11.05 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying Lender s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Lender s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered, without further interest thereon. Each Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off, but subject to Section 11.08 with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this Section 2.13 and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this Section 2.13 shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this

The KPIs, the Company s performance against the KPIs, and any related ESG Applicable Rate Adjustments resulting therefrom, will be determined based on certain certificates, reports and other documents, in each case, setting forth the calculation and measurement of the KPIs in a manner that is aligned with the Core Components of the Sustainability Linked Loan Principles, including certain reporting requirements and third-party assurance of KPI performance, and to be mutually agreed between the Company and the Joint Sustainability Coordinators (each acting reasonably). Notwithstanding anything set forth in Section 11.01 to the contrary, following the effectiveness of an ESG Amendment, any modification to the ESG Pricing Provisions shall be subject only to the consent of the Company and the Required Lenders so long as such modification does not have the effect of reducing the facility fee or the Applicable Rate for Base Rate Loans, Eurocurrency Rate Loans, and letter of credit fees to a level not otherwise permitted by this paragraph on the Closing Date.

 (A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding

 2 

as the case may be. If any Recipient determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Loan Party or with respect to which any Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01 , it shall pay to such Loan Party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by a Loan Party under this Section 3.01 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) incurred by such Recipient, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that each Loan Party, upon the request of the Recipient, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Loan Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Recipient in the event the Recipient is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection, in no event will the applicable Recipient be required to pay any amount to such Loan Party pursuant to this subsection the payment of which would place the Recipient in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Recipient would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This subsection shall not be construed to require any Recipient to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Loan Party or any other Person. 
 3.1.1.7.

Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrowers shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Agent), prepay or, solely in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars convert all Eurocurrency Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Agent without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate. If any of the circumstances set forth above arise with respect to Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, such Alternative Currency denominated Loans shall be made or maintained, as applicable, at a rate for short term borrowings of such Alternative Currency determined in a customary manner in good faith by the Administrative Agent in consultation with the Company. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrowers shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.

3.3 Inability to Determine Rates . 
 3.2.1.1. If in connection with any request for a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or a conversion to or a continuation thereof, (i) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that (A) no Successor Rate for the Relevant Rate for the applicable Agreed Currency has been determined in accordance with Section 3.03(b) or Section 3.03(c and the circumstances under clause (i) of Section 3.03(b) or of Section 3.03(c) or the Scheduled Unavailability Date, or the Term SOFR Scheduled Unavailability Date, has occurred with respect to such Relevant Rate (as applicable), or (B) adequate and reasonable means do not otherwise exist for determining the Relevant Rate for the applicable Agreed Currency for any determination date(s) or requested Interest Period, as applicable, with respect to an existing or proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan or (ii) the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders determine that for any reason that the Relevant Rate with respect to a proposed Loan denominated in an Agreed Currency for any requested Interest Period or determination date(s) does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Company and each Lender. 
 Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies shall be suspended in each case to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Interest Period or determination date(s), as applicable, and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Term SOFR component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. 
 Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the applicable Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, or conversion to, or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Interest Period or determination date(s), as applicable or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans denominated in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the amount specified therein and (ii) any outstanding affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans, at the Company s election, shall either (1) be converted into a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans denominated in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of such outstanding Eurocurrency Rate Loan at the end of the applicable Interest Period or (2) be prepaid in full at the end of the applicable Interest Period provided that if no election is made by the Company in the case of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan, by the last day of the current Interest Period for the applicable Eurocurrency Rate Loan, the Company shall be deemed to have elected clause (1) above. 
 3.2.1.2. Replacement of Term SOFR or Term SOFR Successor Rate . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), or the Company or Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent (with, in the case of the Required Lenders, a copy to the Company) that the Company or Required Lenders (as applicable) have determined, that 
 (i) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining Term SOFR because Term SOFR is not available or published on a current basis and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary or 
 (ii) the Applicable Authority referenced in clause (a) of the definition thereof has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which Term SOFR shall or will no longer be made available, or permitted to be used for determining the interest rate of syndicated loans denominated in Dollars, or shall or will otherwise cease, provided that, in each case, at the time of such statement, there is no successor administrator that is satisfactory to the Administrative Agent that will continue to provide Term SOFR (the date on which Term SOFR is no longer available permanently or indefinitely, the Term SOFR Scheduled Unavailability Date 
 or if the events or circumstances of the type described in Section 3.03(b)(i) or (ii) have occurred with respect to the Term SOFR Successor Rate then in effect, then, the Administrative Agent and the Company may 
 1 

amend this Agreement solely for the purpose of replacing Term SOFR for Dollars or any then current Term SOFR Successor Rate for Dollars in accordance with this Section 3.03 with an alternative benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar credit facilities syndicated and agented in the U.S. and denominated in Dollars for such alternative benchmarks, and, in each case, including any mathematical or other adjustments to such benchmark giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar credit facilities syndicated and agented in the U.S. and denominated in Dollars for such benchmarks, which adjustment or method for calculating such adjustment shall be published on an information service as selected by the Administrative Agent from time to time in its reasonable discretion and may be periodically updated (and any such proposed rate, including for the avoidance of doubt, any adjustment thereto, a Term SOFR Successor Rate ), and any such amendment shall become effective at 5 00 p.m. on the fifth Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Company unless, prior to such time, Lenders comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Required Lenders object to such amendment. 
 3.2.1.3. Replacement of Relevant Rate or Successor Rate . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), or the Company or Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent (with, in the case of the Required Lenders, a copy to the Company) that the Company or Required Lenders (as applicable) have determined, that 
 (i) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Relevant Rate (other than Term SOFR) for an Agreed Currency (other than Dollars) because none of the tenors of such Relevant Rate (other than Term SOFR) under this Agreement is available or published on a current basis, and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary or 
 (ii) the Applicable Authority referenced in clause (b) of the definition thereof has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which all tenors of the Relevant Rate (other than Term SOFR) for an Agreed Currency (other than Dollars) under this Agreement shall or will no longer be representative or made available, or permitted to be used for determining the interest rate of syndicated loans denominated in such Agreed Currency (other than Dollars), or shall or will otherwise cease, provided that, in each case, at the time of such statement, there is no successor administrator that is satisfactory to the Administrative Agent that will continue to provide such representative tenor(s) of the Relevant Rate (other than Term SOFR) for such Agreed Currency (other than Dollars) (the latest date on which all tenors of the Relevant Rate for such Agreed Currency (other than Dollars) under this Agreement are no longer representative or available permanently or indefinitely, the Scheduled Unavailability Date 
 or if the events or circumstances of the type described in Section 3.03(c) (i) or (ii) have occurred with respect to the Successor Rate then in effect, then, the Administrative Agent and the Company may amend this Agreement solely for the purpose of replacing the Relevant Rate for an Agreed Currency or any then current Successor Rate for an Agreed Currency in accordance with this Section 3.03 with an alternative benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar credit facilities syndicated and agented in the U.S. and denominated in such Agreed Currency for such alternative benchmarks, and, in each case, including any mathematical or other adjustments to such benchmark giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar credit facilities syndicated and agented in the U.S. and denominated in such Agreed Currency for such benchmarks, which adjustment or method for calculating such adjustment shall be published on an information service as selected by the Administrative Agent from time to time in its reasonable discretion and may be periodically updated (and any such proposed rate, including for the avoidance of doubt, any adjustment thereto, a Non-SOFR Successor Rate , and collectively with the Term SOFR Successor Rate, each a Successor Rate ), and any such amendment shall become effective at 5 00 p.m. on the fifth Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Company unless, prior to such time, Lenders comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Required Lenders object to such amendment. 
 2 

3.2.1.4. Successor Rate . The Administrative Agent will promptly (in one or more notices) notify the Company and each Lender of the implementation of any Successor Rate 
 Any Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner consistent with market practice provided that to the extent such market practice is not administratively feasible for the Administrative Agent, such Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent. 
 Notwithstanding anything else herein, if at any time any Successor Rate as so determined would otherwise be less than 0 , the Successor Rate will be deemed to be 0 for the purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 
 In connection with the implementation of a Successor Rate the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement provided that, with respect to any such amendment effected, the Administrative Agent shall post each such amendment implementing such Conforming Changes to the Company and the Lenders reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective. 
 3.2.1.5. For purposes of this Section 3.03, those Lenders that either have not made, or do not have an obligation under this Agreement to make, the relevant Loans in the relevant Alternative Currency shall be excluded from any determination of Required Lenders.

 3.2.1.1.3. impose on any Lender or L C Issuer or any applicable interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein

 3 

of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such L C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or L C Issuer or such Lender s or L C Issuer s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s or L C Issuer s policies and the policies of such Lender s or L C Issuer s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrowers will pay to such Lender or L C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or L C Issuer or such Lender s or L C Issuer s holding company for any such reduction suffered. 
 3.2.1.3.

If a Lender fails to give notice 30 days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional costs shall be due and payable 30 days from receipt of such notice. 
 3.2.1.4. Delay in Requests . Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or L C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 3.04 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s or or L C Issuer s right to demand such compensation provided that, notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 3.04(a) , 3.04(b) and 3.04(c), (i) the Borrowers shall only be liable for amounts in respect of increased costs or reductions for the period beginning up to six months prior to the date on which such demand was made (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof), and (ii) the Lender claiming compensation therefor shall have applied consistent return metrics applied to other similarly situated borrowers or obligors with respect to such increased costs or reductions. 

3.5 Funding Losses . Upon demand of any Lender or L C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Company shall promptly compensate such Lender or L C Issuer for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of
