 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 As of and for the three months ended October 31, 2024, and 2023 

for the Three Months ended October 31, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of and negative operating cash outflows of . Further losses are anticipated in the development of its business raising substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period no less than 12 months from the date of this report. In order to remain in business, the Company will need to raise capital in the next twelve months. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand and proceeds from its public offering. The Company has no written or verbal commitments from shareholders, director or officer to provide the Company with any form of cash advances, loans or other sources of liquidity to meet its working capital needs. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations. 
 
 Forward Looking Statements 
 
 This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. We use words such as anticipate, believe, plan, expect, future, intend and similar expressions to identify such forward-looking statements. You should not place too much reliance on these forward-looking statements. Our actual results are likely to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks faced by us described in this section. 
 
 Overview 
 
 We intend to commence business operations by offering real estate management services for clients that focus on cost-efficient operations and tenant retention on a range of properties including residential housing and Class A, B, and C office space, as well as industrial, manufacturing, retail, and warehousing facilities. We also intend to provide our clients with real estate consulting services, including market analysis and modeling, market forecasts, lease and asset management, site selection, feasibility studies, sales and exit strategies, strategic planning, organizational design, capital management, and research services. We intend to commence operations in the Las Vegas, Nevada area due to the significant demand for real estate management services there and the proximity of our management team to that city. 
 
 We were only incorporated on March 24, 2021 and have not commenced pursuing our business plan because we have been focused on raising the initial capital to fund our business operations. As of October 31, 2024, we have incurred an accumulated deficit of 109,869. To date, we have raised an aggregate of 86,779 through the sale of our common stock. Proceeds from these sales were used to fund the filing of this registration statement and will be used for future working capital requirements. Further losses are anticipated in the development of our business. As a result, our auditor has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 Anticipated Services 
 
 We intend to provide clients with two principal types of services: (1) property management; and (2) property consulting. 
 
 Property Management Services 
 
 As property managers, the services that we intend to provide to owners of residential, commercial, and industrial properties include: 
 
 completing an initial evaluation of properties and working with the owners to determine a target rental or lease rate; 
 
 gathering comparable rental and lease rates in the area of the properties; 
 
 reviewing the properties to determine if any repairs or upgrades should be recommended to the owners to increase rental or lease value; 
 
 gathering detailed information regarding the features of the properties, including interior and exterior photographs; 
 
 discussing with the owners the policies that they would like to implement with respect to the rental or lease arrangements (e.g., acceptability of pets in a residential property; acceptable uses for commercial and industrial properties); 
 
 marketing the properties for rent or lease by creating advertisements in various media including online, print, on-site signage, and fliers depending on the suitability of each medium for the type of property involved; 
 
 answering potential tenant and lessee inquiries; meeting with them to view properties; and collecting applications and deposits; 
 2 
 
 performing background and credit checks on prospective tenants and lessees; 
 
 communicating with the property owners regarding prospective tenants and lessees; 
 
 preparing and overseeing the execution of lease agreements; 
 
 performing move-in inspections with tenants and lessees and having them execute a report verifying the condition of the property prior to the lease commencement date; 
 
 collecting security deposits, rents, and lease payments; 
 
 pursuing late payments and fees; 
 
 where necessary, preparing the necessary paperwork to evict or commence an unlawful detainer action; 
 
 performing periodic property inspections and providing the results of each inspection to the owner if there are concerns regarding the condition of the property; 
 
 providing accounting services to document and record cash inflows and outflows, as well as related invoices, receipts, and payment information; 
 
 preparing monthly cash flow statements and annual reports of financial results including required tax documents for the owners; 
 
 overseeing maintenance and repairs on properties; and 
 
 managing tenant and lessee move-out including inspections, damage assessment, and damage deposit returns. 
 
 We intend to generate revenue by charging owners a set monthly fee for our property management services, which will usually be based on a percentage of the revenue that a rented or leased property generates. Such fees will vary depending on the type of property involved, the amount of work that we will have to perform, and the rates that competitors charge for similar services. 
 
 Property Consulting Services 
 
 As property consultants, the services that we intend to provide include: 
 
 preparing plans of action and evaluation for clients considering real estate acquisitions and development; 
 
 interpreting relevant real estate market data concerning price, yield, market stability, investment risks and trends, regulation, and economic influences; 
 
 searching public records for transactions such as sales, leases, and assessments; 
 
 computing property values while considering factors such as depreciation, replacement cost, comparable properties, and income potential; 
 
 obtaining county land values and sales information in support of value assessments; 
 
 checking building codes and zoning bylaws that may impact appraisal and development; 
 
 estimating building replacement costs using building valuation manuals and professional cost estimators; 
 
 inspecting properties to evaluate construction, condition, features, and functional design; 
 
 evaluating land and neighborhoods where properties are situated including assessing locations, trends, and pending changes that could influence present and developed land value; 
 3 
 
 providing market analysis and modelling for properties, as well as market forecasts and research; and 
 
 providing advice on site selection, feasibility studies, sales and exit strategies, strategic planning, organizational design, and capital management. 
 
 We intend to generate revenue by charging owners either an hourly rate for our services or a set price for certain service that we reach through negotiation with the clients. Initially, two of our directors, Gregory Navone, and James C. Shaw will provide these services to clients. As our operations expand, we will need to retain additional staff in order to provide all of the above-noted services. 
 
 Demand for Property Management and Consulting Services 
 
 According to the University of Nevada Las Vegas Center for Business and Economic Research s 2019 report, the population of Clark County in which Las Vegas is situated is expected to grow from 2,284,616 residents in 2018 to approximately 2,719,000 residents in 2030, which represents a population increase of about 19 within that time frame. Cumming Corporation, an international construction management company that provides forecasts regarding construction trends in various jurisdictions, projects that the residential construction will increase in 2021 by almost 30 with multi-family rather than single-family residences driving this growth. However, the firm foresees that demand will outpace supply due to labor and supply chain constraints. These trends will likely increase demand for residential, commercial, and industrial real estate in the area, as well as increase demand for property management and consulting services. 
 
 Marketing Strategy 
 
 While we intend to offer our services to all sectors of the property management and consulting markets, we will initially focus on commercial real and multi-unit residential estate given our president s experience in developing and operating shopping centers and apartment buildings in Las Vegas. We believe that we will be able to charge higher rates for our services in these sectors because they tend to generate relatively higher profit margins for owners and often require significant professional management and advice due to the large scale of construction and operations. 
 
 In order to reach our target market sectors, we intend to rely upon the real estate and other business relationships that our directors have established in the Las Vegas area and also focus our marketing efforts on our Internet presence, electronic brochures, and as our business develops, print media advertising. We believe that social media tools are critically important to building our brand and awareness of our business and will focus on online video advertising, client testimonials, and virtual tours of available properties that we manage. We also intend to select and place advertising on those social media platforms that will be effective in reaching our target clients. 
 
 Results of Operations for the Three Months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Our net loss for the three-month period ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 was 2,955 and 2,780, respectively, which consisted entirely of general and administrative fees. We did not generate any revenue to date. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 As at October 31, 2024, our current assets were 15,483 compared to 15,638 as of July 31, 2024. The slight decrease in current assets in the current fiscal year is due to use of cash to pay ordinary business expenses. 
 
 As at October 31, 2024, our liabilities were 41,952 compared to 39,152 at July 31, 2024, which comprised entirely of accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The increase in liabilities in the current fiscal year is due to accruing for accounting and professional fees. 
 
 We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other methods, the sale of equity or debt securities. 
 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 
 For the three-month period ended October 31, 2024, net cash flows generated from operating activities were (155) consisting of a net loss of 2,955, which was offset by non-cash components of accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 2,800 from the accrual of the accounting and professional fees. 
 4 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 
 For the period ended October 31, 2024, we did not generate or use cash flows in relation to investing activities. 
 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 
 For the period ended October 31, 2024, we did not generate or use cash flows in relation to financing activities. 
 
 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 
 As of the date of this report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 
 
 GOING CONCERN 
 
 The independent auditors report accompanying our July 31, 2024 financial statements contained an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 During the three months ended October 31, 2024, there were no material changes in the market risks described in the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 As supervised by our board of directors and our principal executive and principal financial officer, management has established a system of disclosure, controls and procedures and has evaluated the effectiveness of that system. The system and its evaluation are reported on in the below Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our principal executive and financial officer has concluded that our disclosure, controls and procedures (as defined in Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of April 30, 2021, were not effective, based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15. 
 
 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 Management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2024. We carried out this assessment using the criteria of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. 
 
 This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm, pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report. Management concluded in this assessment that as of October 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting is not effective. 
 
 There have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the first quarter of our 2024 fiscal year that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
