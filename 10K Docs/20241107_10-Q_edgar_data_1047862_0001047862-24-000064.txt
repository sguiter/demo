FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This report contains forward-looking statements that are intended to qualify for the safe-harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations and not facts. Words such as forecasts, expects, estimates, anticipates, intends, believes, plans, will, target, guidance, potential, "goal," consider and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements reflect information available and assumptions at the time the statements are made, and accordingly speak only as of that time. Actual results or developments might differ materially from those included in the forward-looking statements because of various factors such as those identified in reports the Companies have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to: 
 the Companies are extensively regulated and are subject to substantial penalties; 
 the Utilities rate plans may not provide a reasonable return; 
 the Companies may be adversely affected by changes to the Utilities rate plans; 
 the failure of, or damage to, the Companies facilities could adversely affect the Companies; 
 a cyber attack could adversely affect the Companies; 
 the failure of processes and systems, the failure to retain and attract employees and contractors, and their negative performance could adversely affect the Companies; 
 the Companies are exposed to risks from the environmental consequences of their operations, including increased costs related to climate change; 
 Con Edison s ability to pay dividends or interest depends on dividends from its subsidiaries; 
 changes to tax laws could adversely affect the Companies; 
 the Companies require access to capital markets to satisfy funding requirements; 
 a disruption in the wholesale energy markets, increased commodity costs or failure by an energy supplier or customer could adversely affect the Companies; 
 the Companies face risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks; 
 the Companies strategies may not be effective to address changes in the external business environment; 
 the Companies face risks related to supply chain disruptions and inflation; and 
 the Companies also face other risks that are beyond their control. 
 This list of factors is not all-inclusive because it is not possible to predict all factors that could cause actual results or developments to differ from the forward-looking statements. The Companies assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

Variable Interest Entities 
 The accounting rules for consolidation address the consolidation of a variable interest entity (VIE) by a business enterprise that is the primary beneficiary. A VIE is an entity that does not have a sufficient equity investment at risk to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. The primary beneficiary is the business enterprise that has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and either absorbs a significant amount of the VIE s losses or has the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the VIE. 
 The Companies enter into arrangements including leases, partnerships and electricity purchase agreements, with various entities. As a result of these arrangements, the Companies retain or may retain a variable interest in these entities.

The NYSDPS testimony supports a gas rate decrease of million, reflecting, among other things, a percent return on common equity and a common equity ratio of percent. 
 
 Bill Relief Program 
 In March 2024, CECONY and O R received million and million, respectively, pursuant to a New York State bill relief program funded by the state that provided a one-time bill credit for electric and gas customers. The program was established to partially offset the costs all customers pay to fund utility energy affordability programs. 
 
 Other Regulatory Matters 
 In January 2023, CECONY initiated a review of welds on certain gas and steam mains following the company s discovery of a leak from a gas main weld in Queens, New York. During the course of its review thus far, CECONY discovered a limited number of other non-conforming gas and steam main welds. New York regulations require utilities to perform and record weld films for certain gas and steam main welds. Upon reviewing these films, CECONY determined that in some instances third-party contractors engaged in misconduct by substituting duplicate weld films for different welds, while another third-party contractor had created poor quality weld films. CECONY voluntarily disclosed its initial review and findings to the NYSDPS which, in turn, initiated its own investigation. CECONY also reported the contractors misconduct to law enforcement. Given the nature of the non-conforming welds identified, CECONY does not anticipate significant impact to the operation of its gas and steam mains. CECONY continues to investigate this matter, is remediating and monitoring the known non-conforming welds and is cooperating with the NYSDPS on its investigation of this matter. CECONY is unable to estimate the amount or

million cap established in CECONY s 2020 2022 electric and gas rate plans. CECONY s final costs for the new system were million million above the million cap in the rate plans). CECONY believes that the incremental costs were both prudent and necessary for the successful deployment of the system for the benefit of its customers. In May 2024, CECONY expensed incremental costs of million for the new system that were previously capitalized, in addition to a million reserve established at December 31, 2023. In June 2024, CECONY filed a petition for rehearing with the NYSPSC. CECONY is unable to predict the NYSPSC's response to its rehearing petition. 
 
 In January 2018, the NYSPSC issued an order initiating a focused operations audit of the Utilities financial accounting for income taxes. The audit is investigating the Utilities inadvertent understatement of a portion, the amount of which may be material, of their calculation of total federal income tax expense for ratemaking purposes related to the calculation of plant retirement-related cost of removal. As a result of such understatement, the Utilities accumulated significant income tax regulatory assets million and million for CECONY and O R, respectively, as of September 30, 2024 and million and million for CECONY and O R, respectively, as of December 31, 2023) which are not earning a return. While the Utilities have properly calculated and paid their federal income taxes and there is no uncertain tax position related to this matter, this understatement of historical income tax expense materially reduced the amount of revenue collected from the Utilities' customers in the past relative to what it should have been. The Utilities rate plans have reflected the correct amount of federal income taxes recoverable from customers, including a proportionate recovery of the regulatory asset, beginning with O R s rate plans effective November 2015, CECONY s electric and gas rate plans effective January 2017, and CECONY s steam plan effective November 2023. As part of the audit, the Utilities plan to pursue a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) confirming that the Utilities inadvertent understatement of prior years income tax expense constitutes a normalization violation that can be cured through an increase in future years revenue requirements until such time as the regulatory asset is fully recovered in rates, and not through a write-down of all or a portion of the Utilities regulatory asset. Under Accounting Standards Codification Topic (ASC) 740, the Utilities recorded an unfunded deferred federal income tax liability (with a gross-up amount) and a corresponding regulatory asset. The income tax regulatory assets are netted against the related regulatory liability for future income tax and are shown in the line Future income tax in the following table of Regulatory Assets and Liabilities and on the Companies consolidated balance sheets in the line Regulatory liabilities. Management s assessment is that the income tax regulatory assets as of September 30, 2024 are probable of collection through future rates. The IRS provides safe harbor relief for inadvertent normalization violations through the jurisdictional rate setting process of including in rates adequate revenue to fully recover the deferred tax balance. However, the Utilities would record a liability or impair a portion of the regulatory assets associated with this understatement if the NYSPSC were to issue an order that required the Utilities to write off all or a portion of their existing regulatory asset. The Utilities are unable to estimate the amount or range of their possible loss, if any, related to this matter. At September 30, 2024, the Utilities had not accrued a liability related to this matter.

 Most of the accrued Superfund Site liability relates to sites that have been investigated, in whole or in part. However, for some of the sites, the extent and associated cost of the required remediation has not yet been determined. As investigations progress and information pertaining to the required remediation becomes available, the Utilities expect that additional liability may be accrued, the amount of which is not presently determinable but may be material. The Utilities defer prudently incurred investigation and remediation costs as regulatory assets (for subsequent recovery through rates).

 multi-use five-story tall buildings located on Park Avenue between 116 th and 117 th Streets in Manhattan were destroyed by an explosion and fire. CECONY had delivered gas to the buildings through service lines from a distribution main located below ground on Park Avenue. people died and more than people were injured. Additional buildings were also damaged. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigated. The parties to the investigation included CECONY, the City of New York, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and the NYSPSC. In June 2015, the NTSB issued a final report concerning the incident, its probable cause and safety recommendations. The NTSB determined that the probable cause of the incident was (1) the failure of a defective fusion joint at a service tee (which joined a plastic service line to a plastic distribution main) installed by CECONY that allowed gas to leak from the distribution main and migrate into a building where it ignited and (2) a breach in a city sewer line that allowed groundwater and soil to flow into the sewer, resulting in a loss of support for the distribution main, that caused it to sag and overstressed the defective fusion joint. The NTSB also made safety recommendations, including recommendations to CECONY that addressed its procedures for the preparation and examination of plastic fusions, training of its staff on conditions for notifications to the city s Fire Department and extension of its gas main isolation valve installation program. In February 2017, the NYSPSC approved a settlement agreement with CECONY related to the NYSPSC's investigations of the incident and the practices of qualifying persons to perform plastic fusions. Pursuant to the agreement, CECONY provided million of future benefits to customers (for which it accrued a regulatory liability) and did not recover from customers million of costs for gas emergency response activities that it had previously incurred and expensed. Lawsuits are pending against CECONY seeking generally unspecified damages and, in some cases, punitive damages, for wrongful death, personal injury, property damage and business interruption. CECONY notified its insurers of the incident and believes that the policies in force at the time of the incident will cover CECONY s costs, in excess of a required retention (the amount of which is not material), to satisfy any liability it may have for damages in connection with the incident. During 2020, CECONY accrued its estimated liability for the suits of million and an insurance receivable in the same amount, and such estimated liability and receivable did not change as of September 30, 2024.

 Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax 
 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law and implemented a new corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) that imposes a 15 percent tax on modified GAAP net income. Pursuant to the IRA, corporations are entitled to a tax credit (minimum tax credit) to the extent the CAMT liability exceeds the regular tax liability. This amount can be carried forward indefinitely and used in future years when regular tax exceeds the CAMT. 
 
 Beginning in 2024, based on the existing statute, the Companies are subject to and report the CAMT in their Consolidated Income Statements, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Companies accrued a CAMT liability of million, million of which is for CECONY, before the application of general business credits, with an offsetting deferred tax asset representing the minimum tax credit carryforward, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The deferred tax asset related to the minimum tax credit carryforward will be realized to the extent the Companies consolidated deferred tax liabilities exceed the minimum tax credit carryforward. The Companies deferred tax liabilities are expected to exceed the minimum tax credit carryforward for the foreseeable future and thus no valuation allowance is required. The Companies are continuing to assess the impacts of the IRA on their financial statements and will update estimates based on future guidance to be issued by the Department of the Treasury. 
 
 Uncertain Tax Positions 
 At September 30, 2024, the estimated liability for uncertain tax positions for Con Edison was million, million of which is for CECONY). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Con Edison recognized million, all of which is for CECONY, of income tax expense related to current year positions. Con Edison reasonably expects to resolve within the next twelve months approximately million (the entire amount attributable to CECONY) of various federal uncertainties due to the expected completion of ongoing tax examinations, of which the entire amount, if recognized, would reduce their effective tax rate. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, that would reduce Con Edison s effective tax rate is million million, net of federal income taxes) with million attributable to CECONY. 
 
 The Companies recognize interest on liabilities for uncertain tax positions in interest expense and would recognize penalties, if any, in operating expenses in the Companies consolidated income statements. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Companies recognized an immaterial amount of interest expense and no penalties for uncertain tax positions in their consolidated income statements. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Companies recognized an immaterial amount of accrued interest on their consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 In February 2024, New York State completed its examination of the Companies' New York State income and franchise tax returns for tax years 2015 through 2021 with no changes. The Companies' return for tax year 2022 remains open under the statute of limitations.

 The Utilities generally recover their prudently incurred fuel, purchased power and gas costs, including hedging gains and losses, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable state utility regulators. In accordance with the accounting rules for regulated operations, the Utilities record a regulatory asset or regulatory liability to defer recognition of unrealized gains and losses on their electric and gas derivatives. As gains and losses are realized in future periods, they will be recognized as purchased power, gas and fuel costs in the Companies consolidated income statements.

Con Edison s net credit exposure consisted of million with investment-grade counterparties and million with commodity exchange brokers. CECONY s net credit exposure consisted of million with investment-grade counterparties and million with commodity exchange brokers. On March 1, 2023, Con Edison completed the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses. See Note R and Note S. 
 The collateral requirements associated with, and settlement of, derivative transactions are included in net cash flows from operating activities in the Companies consolidated statements of cash flows. Most derivative instrument contracts contain provisions that may require a party to provide collateral on its derivative instruments that are in a net liability position. The amount of collateral to be provided will depend on the fair value of the derivative instruments and the party s credit ratings.

 (a) Non-derivative transactions for the purchase and sale of electricity and gas and qualifying derivative instruments, that have been designated as normal purchases or normal sales, are excluded from the table. These transactions primarily include purchases of electricity from independent system operators. In the event the Utilities are no longer extended unsecured credit for such purchases, the Companies would be required to post million of additional collateral at September 30, 2024. For certain other such non-derivative transactions, the Companies could be required to post collateral under certain circumstances, including in the event counterparties had reasonable grounds for insecurity. 
 (b) The Companies measure the collateral requirements by taking into consideration the fair value amounts of derivative instruments that contain credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position plus amounts owed to counterparties for settled transactions and amounts required by counterparties for minimum financial security. The fair value amounts represent unrealized losses, net of any unrealized gains where the Companies have a legally enforceable right to offset. 
 (c) Derivative instruments that are net assets have been excluded from the table. At September 30, 2024, if Con Edison had been downgraded to below investment grade, it would have been required to post additional collateral for such derivative instruments of million.

 (a) The Companies policy is to review the fair value hierarchy and recognize transfers into and transfers out of the levels at the end of each reporting period . Con Edison and CECON Y had million of commodity derivative assets and an amount of liabilities transferred from level 3 to level 2 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 because of availability of observable market data due to the decrease in the terms of certain contracts from beyond three years as of December 31, 2023 to less than three years as of September 30, 2024. Con Edison and CECONY had an amount of derivative assets and million and million of commodity derivative liabilities, respectively, transferred from level 3 to level 2 during the year ended December 31, 2023 because of availability of observable market data due to the decrease in the terms of certain contracts from beyond three years as of September 30, 2023 to less than three years as of December 31, 2023. 
 (b) Level 2 assets and liabilities include investments held in the deferred compensation plan and/or non-qualified retirement plans, exchange-traded contracts where there is insufficient market liquidity to warrant inclusion in Level 1, and certain over-the-counter derivative instruments for electricity, refined products and natural gas. Derivative instruments classified as Level 2 are valued using industry standard models that incorporate corroborated observable inputs, such as pricing services or prices from similar instruments that trade in liquid markets, time value and volatility factors. 
 (c) The accounting rules for fair value measurements and disclosures require consideration of the impact of nonperformance risk (including credit risk) from a market participant perspective in the measurement of the fair value of assets and liabilities. At September 30, 2024 and

 In addition to the Companies material contingencies described in Notes B, G and H to the Third Quarter Financial Statements, the Companies management considers the following events, trends, and uncertainties to be important to understanding the Companies current and future financial condition. 

48 

Aged Accounts Receivable Balances 
 At September 30, 2024, CECONY s and O R s customer accounts receivables balances of 2,904 million and 123 million, respectively, included aged accounts receivables (balances outstanding in excess of 60 days) of 1,654 million and 34 million, respectively. In comparison, CECONY s and O R s customer accounts receivable balances at February 28, 2020 were 1,322 million and 89 million, respectively, including aged accounts receivables (balances outstanding in excess of 60 days) of 408 million and 15 million, respectively. Prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Utilities practice was to write off customer accounts receivables as uncollectible 90 days after the account is disconnected for non-payment or the account is closed during the collection process. In general, the Utilities suspended collection activities and service disconnections during the COVID-19 pandemic and have since resumed such activities. CECONY s rate plans include reconciliation of late payment charges (from January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2025 for electric and gas and from January 1, 2020 through October 31, 2026 for steam) and write-offs of customer accounts receivable balances (from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2025 for electric and gas and from January 1, 2020 through October 31, 2026 for steam) to amounts reflected in rates, with recovery/refund from or to customers via surcharge/sur-credit. CECONY's surcharge recoveries for late payment charges and write-offs of accounts receivable balances will, collectively, be subject to separate annual caps for electric and gas that produce no more than a half percent (0.5 percent) total customer bill impact per commodity (estimated for electric to be 57.3 million, 60.3 million, 62.6 million for 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively, and for gas to be 14.8 million, 15.9 million and 16.8 million for 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively). CECONY's surcharge recoveries for late payment charges and write-offs of accounts receivables for steam will each be subject to an annual cap that produces no more than half percent (0.5 percent) total customer bill impact (estimated to be 2.5 million, 3.0 million and 3.5 million for 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively). Amounts in excess of the surcharge caps will be deferred as a regulatory asset for recovery in CECONY s next base rate cases. O R s 2022 - 2024 rate plans include reconciliation of late payment charges to amounts reflected in rates for years 2022 through 2024, with full recovery/refund via surcharge/sur-credit once the annual variance equals or exceeds 5 basis points of return on equity and reconciliation of write-offs of customer accounts receivable balances to amounts reflected in rates from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2024, with full recovery/refund via surcharge/sur-credit once the annual variance equals or exceeds 5 basis points of return on equity. Although these regulatory mechanisms are in place, a continued increase in accounts receivable balances has impacted and is expected to continue to impact the Companies liquidity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources, below, and Note B and Note L to the Third Quarter Financial Statements. 
 
 In May 2024, the NYSPSC issued an order implementing amendments to certain provisions of the New York State Public Service Law that require utilities, including CECONY and O R, to bill most residential and small non-residential customers within three months instead of six months of the end of their service period, to provide 13 months of usage information on all electric, gas and steam bills and to make available two years of historical billing information upon customer request. The NYSPSC also ordered the NYSDPS to further consider regulations that would expand the new billing requirements to large non-residential customers and to prohibit utilities, including CECONY and O R, from recovering revenue lost due to untimely billing. 
 
 Clean Energy Goals 
 The success of the Companies efforts to meet federal, state and city clean energy policy goals and the impact of energy consumers' efforts to meet such goals on CECONY s electric, gas and steam businesses and O R s electric and gas businesses may impact the Companies future financial condition. The Utilities expect electric usage to increase and gas and steam usage to decrease in their service territories as federal, state and local laws and policies are enacted and implemented that aim to reduce the carbon intensity of the energy that is consumed in their respective jurisdictions. The Utilities and their regulators efforts to maintain electric reliability in their service territories as electric usage increases may also impact the Companies future financial condition. The long-term future of the Utilities gas businesses depends upon the role that natural gas or other gaseous fuels will play in facilitating New York State s and New York City s climate goals. In addition, the impact and costs of climate change on the Utilities systems and the success of the Utilities efforts to maintain system reliability and manage service interruptions resulting from severe weather may impact the Companies future financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.

Con Edison Transmission 
 Con Edison Transmission, through its New York Transco partnership and jointly NYPA, is developing the Propel NY Energy transmission project that will deliver offshore wind energy from Long Island to New York City, Westchester County and the rest of New York State's high voltage power grid. Con Edison Transmission is also participating in competitive solicitations to develop additional electric projects, including a proposal submitted in April 2024 with another entity to build transmission infrastructure that will carry offshore wind power to New Jersey's electric grid and multiple proposals submitted in June 2024 through its New York Transco partnership to integrate electricity produced from offshore wind into New York City's energy grid. The success of Con Edison Transmission s efforts in these competitive solicitations and to grow its electric transmission portfolio may impact Con Edison s future capital requirements. 
 
 CECONY 
 Electric 
 CECONY provides electric service to approximately 3.7 million customers in all of New York City (except a part of Queens) and most of Westchester County, an approximately 660 square mile service area with a population of more than nine million. 
 
 During the summer of 2024, electric peak demand in CECONY's service area was 11,822 MW (which occurred on July 16, 2024). At design conditions, electric peak demand in CECONY's service area would have been approximately 12,540 MW in 2024 compared to the company's forecast of 12,800 MW. The lower peak demand at design conditions as compared to the forecast primarily reflects lower than anticipated new business. CECONY increased its five-year forecast of average annual growth in electric peak demand in its service area at design conditions from approximately 0.7 percent (for 2024 to 2028) to approximately 1.0 percent (for 2025 to 2029). 
 
 Gas 
 CECONY delivers gas to approximately 1.1 million customers in Manhattan, the Bronx, parts of Queens and most of Westchester County. 
 
 In June 2024, CECONY decreased its five-year forecast of average annual growth of the firm peak gas demand in its service area at design conditions from approximately 0.8 percent (for 2024 to 2028) to approximately 0.1 percent (for 2025 to 2029). The decrease is reflective of and aligned with state and local clean energy future policies driving the phase-out of the use of natural gas. 
 
 Steam 
 CECONY operates the largest steam distribution system in the United States by producing and delivering approximately 15,444 MMlb of steam annually to approximately 1,510 customers in parts of Manhattan. 
 
 In June 2024, CECONY increased its five-year forecast of the average annual peak steam demand in its service area at design conditions from a 0.5 percent decrease (for 2024 to 2028) to a 0.4 percent decrease (for 2025 to 2029). The increase is reflective of and aligned with local policies driving the phase-out of the use of natural gas along with an anticipated increase in oil-to-steam customer conversions. 
 
 Collective Bargaining Agreement 
 In June 2024, CECONY reached a collective bargaining agreement with its largest union covering approximately 7,300 employees. The union subsequently ratified the four-year agreement with an effective date of June 23, 2024. 
 
 O R 
 Electric 
 O R and its utility subsidiary, Rockland Electric Company (RECO) (together referred to herein as O R) provide electric service to approximately 0.3 million customers in southeastern New York and northern New Jersey an approximately 1,300 square mile service area. 

50 

During the summer of 2024, electric peak demand in O R's service area was 1,484 MW (which occurred on July 16, 2024). At design conditions, electric peak demand in O R's service area would have been approximately 1,533 MW in 2024 compared to O R's forecast of 1,530 MW. O R increased its five-year forecast of average annual growth in electric peak demand in its service area at design conditions from approximately 2.0 percent (for 2024 to 2028) to approximately 3.7 percent (for 2025 to 2029). 
 
 Gas 
 O R delivers gas to over 0.1 million customers in southeastern New York. 
 
 In June 2024, O R increased its five-year forecast of the average annual firm peak gas demand in its service area at design conditions from a 0.2 percent decrease (for 2024 to 2028) to a 0.1 percent decrease (for 2025 to 2029). This change is reflective of and aligned with state clean energy future policies driving the phase-out of the use of natural gas.

 Inflation Reduction Act 
 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA) was signed into law and included a new 15 percent Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT). Under the IRA, a corporation is subject to the CAMT if its average annual adjusted financial statement Income for the three taxable year period ending prior to the taxable year exceeds 1,000 million, and applies to tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. Con Edison and CECONY were not subject to the CAMT in 2023 and are subject to the CAMT beginning in 2024. The Companies are continuing to assess the impacts of the IRA on their financial statements and will update estimates based on future guidance to be issued by the Department of the Treasury. 

New York Legislation 
 In April 2021, New York passed a law that increased the corporate franchise tax rate on business income from 6.5 percent to 7.25 percent, retroactive to January 1, 2021, for taxpayers with taxable income greater than 5 million. The law also reinstated the business capital tax at 0.1875 percent, not to exceed a maximum tax liability of 5 million per taxpayer. New York requires a corporate franchise taxpayer to calculate and pay the highest amount of tax under the three alternative methods: a tax on business income; a tax on business capital; or a fixed dollar minimum. The provisions to increase the corporate franchise tax rate and reinstate a capital tax were scheduled to expire after 2023. In May 2023, New York passed a law that extended the increase in the corporate franchise tax rate from 6.5 percent to 7.25 percent for an additional three years, through tax year 2026 and extended the business capital tax through tax year 2026. New York also passed a law establishing a permanent rate of 30 percent for the metropolitan transportation business tax surcharge. As a result of the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses in 2023, Con Edison s New York State taxable income was higher than 5 million and it was subject to the higher 7.25 percent rate (9.425 percent with the surcharge rate) on its taxable income for tax year 2023, but is not expected to be subject to the higher rate in tax year 2024.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Companies monitor the financial markets closely, including borrowing rates and daily cash collections. Increases in aged accounts receivable balances, inflationary pressure and higher interest rates have increased the amount of capital needed by the Utilities and the costs of such capital. See "Interest Rate Risk," below, "Aged Accounts Receivable Balances," above and "Capital Resources," below. 
 
 Con Edison and the Utilities have a 2,500 million revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) in place under which banks are committed to provide loans on a revolving credit basis until March 2029, unless extended for an additional one-year term, subject to certain conditions. CECONY has a 500 million 364-day revolving credit agreement (the CECONY Credit Agreement) in place under which banks are committed to provide loans on a revolving credit basis until March 2025, subject to certain conditions. Con Edison and the Utilities have not entered into any loans under the Credit Agreement and CECONY has not entered into any loans under the CECONY Credit Agreement. See Note D to the Third Quarter Financial Statements. 
 
 FERC has authorized CECONY through April 30, 2026 and O R through July 31, 2026 to issue short-term borrowings for a period of not more than 12 months, in an amount not to exceed 4,000 million and 250 million, respectively, at prevailing market rates.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 The Utilities cash flows from operating activities primarily reflect their energy sales and deliveries and cost of operations. The volume of energy sales and deliveries is primarily affected by factors external to the Utilities, such as customer demand, weather, market prices for energy and economic conditions. Measures that promote distributed energy resources, such as distributed generation, demand reduction and energy efficiency, also affect the volume of energy sales and deliveries. 
 
 Pursuant to their rate plans, the Utilities have recovered from customers a portion of the tax liability they will pay in the future as a result of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. These temporary differences affect the timing of cash flows, but not net income, as the Companies are required to record deferred tax assets and liabilities at the current corporate tax rate for the temporary differences. For the Utilities, credits to their customers of the net benefits of the TCJA, including the reduction of the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, decrease cash flows from operating activities. Pursuant to their rate plans, the Utilities also recover from customers the amount of property taxes they will pay. The payment of property taxes by the Utilities affects the timing of cash flows and increases the amount of short-term borrowings issued by the Utilities when property taxes are due and as property taxes increase, but generally does not impact net income. See Note J to the Third Quarter Financial Statements. 
 
 In general, the Utilities suspended service disconnections during the COVID-19 pandemic and have since resumed such activities in accordance with applicable law. At September 30, 2024, CECONY's and O R's customer accounts receivables balances of 2,904 million and 123 million, respectively, included aged accounts receivables (balances outstanding in excess of 60 days) of 1,654 million and 34 million, respectively. A continued increase in accounts receivable balances has impacted and is expected to continue to impact the Companies' liquidity. See Aged Accounts Receivable Balances, above. 
 
 Net income is the result of cash and non-cash (or accrual) transactions. Only cash transactions affect the Companies cash flows from operating activities. Principal non-cash charges or credits include depreciation, deferred income tax expense, amortizations of certain regulatory assets and liabilities and accrued unbilled revenue. Non-cash charges or credits may also be accrued under the revenue decoupling and cost reconciliation mechanisms in the Utilities New York electric and gas rate plans. 
 
 Net cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 for Con Edison were 1,123 million higher than in the 2023 period. The change in net cash flows for Con Edison primarily reflects:

In September 2024, the NYSPSC issued an order evaluating the combined gas system long-term plan (the GSLTP) filed by the Utilities in November 2023. The order directs the Utilities to make additional filings to further the process of decarbonizing their gas systems and achieving the GHG emission reduction targets established in the CLCPA. These additional filings include, among other things, a proposal for a demand response program; a non-pipes alternatives deployment plan; a report on pipeline safety, including records to substantiate maximum allowable operating pressure in certain pipe segments; a definition of hard-to-electrify customers; reports on the benefits to, and impacts on, disadvantaged communities; and a bill impact analysis that reflects reduced natural gas usage over a 20-year period for every service classification. The order also directs the Utilities to include certain information in their annual updates to the GSLTP and in their next GSLTP, due 2027, such as increases in electric load and associated reliability impacts and a description of a scenario that meets all load growth with non-pipe alternatives rather than additional infrastructure, and for the Utilities to identify a preferred pathway among the three pathways set forth in the GSLTP. 
 
 Also in September 2024, O R entered into a settlement agreement that is subject to approval by the FERC. The settlement agreement provides for a formula rate to the NYISO tariff to enable O R to recover the costs and a return on equity of: (1) 10.5 percent for transmission projects that O R exercises its right of first refusal; (2) 10.85 percent for all other transmission projects selected by the NYISO to meet a public policy transmission need; and (3) the lower of the NYSPSC-determined rates or 10.6 percent for transmission projects needed to meet local New York State climate and renewable energy goals. If approved, parties to the settlement agreement would be restricted from seeking to challenge the return on equity levels for five years. 
 
 In August 2024, CECONY entered into a settlement agreement that is subject to approval by the FERC. The settlement agreement provides for a formula rate to the NYISO tariff to enable CECONY to recover the costs and a return on equity of: (1) 10.6 percent for transmission projects that CECONY exercises its right of first refusal; (2) 10.85 percent for all other transmission projects selected by the NYISO to meet a public policy transmission need; and (3) the lower of the NYSPSC-determined rates or 10.6 percent for transmission projects needed to meet local New York State climate and renewable energy goals. If approved, parties to the settlement agreement would be restricted from seeking to challenge the return on equity levels for five years. 
 
 In August 2024, New York Transco entered into a settlement agreement for its Propel NY Energy project that is subject to approval by the FERC. Con Edison Transmission has a 41.7 percent interest in New York Transco's share of the Propel NY Energy project that is jointly owned with NYPA. The settlement agreement provides for a formula rate to the NYISO tariff to enable New York Transco to recover the costs and a return on equity of 11.3 percent (which is comprised of a 10.3 percent return on equity and 75 basis points added for risk and 25 basis points added for grid enhancement). If approved, parties to the settlement agreement would be restricted from seeking to challenge the return on equity levels until after May 31, 2030. In addition, the Propel NY Energy project will receive construction work in progress and abandoned plant incentives. 
 
 Also in August 2024, the NYSPSC issued an order instituting a proceeding that directs New York utilities, including CECONY and O R, to proactively identify and develop grid upgrades needed to meet new demand from transportation and building heating electrification across New York State. The order directs the utilities to develop a joint filing that identifies these needs and describes, among other things, timelines, utility data assumptions, evaluation criteria, cost recovery and cost allocation for projects. The order also allows each individual utility to request approval from the NYSPSC for urgent upgrades that begin construction before the completion of the joint utilities proposed planning process, which is estimated to occur in the first half of 2026. 
 
 In May 2024, CECONY filed its inaugural annual Investing in Disadvantaged Communities Report, as required by the NYSPSC. The report summarizes the impacts of CECONY's investments in disadvantaged communities (DACs) within the company s service territory, based on 2023 data. The report includes, among other things, building electrification and energy efficiency initiatives, as well as data related to the company s long-running electric and gas operations. DAC locations were identified by New York State in connection with the implementation process for the CLCPA. 
 
 Offshore Wind 
 In February 2024, NYSERDA announced that it selected two offshore wind projects for contract negotiations representing 1,734 MW of energy by 2026. One of the conditional awards, Empire Wind 1, is expected to connect 810 MW of offshore wind electricity to the New York City electrical grid at CECONY s Gowanus substation. In March 2024, FERC approved the interconnection agreement among Empire Offshore Wind, LLC, the NYISO, and CECONY. In May 2024, the NYSPSC approved a certificate of public convenience and necessity to allow 
 construction of Empire Wind 1 to begin. 

78 

Energy Storage 
 In June 2024, the NYSPSC issued an order adopting an updated roadmap for achieving 6,000 MW of statewide energy storage resource deployment by 2030 and recognized the need for additional statewide energy storage of 12,000 MW by 2040 and 17,000 MW by 2050. The NYSPSC directed New York utilities, including CECONY and O R, to study the potential of energy storage to provide non-market transmission and distribution services and identify services that are cost-effective compared to traditional alternatives. 
 
 Thermal Energy Networks 
 In April 2024, the NYSDPS approved CECONY s and O R s December 2023 Stage 1 filings (Project Scope, Feasibility, and Stakeholder Engagement) for utility-scale thermal energy network pilot projects. The NYSDPS also confirmed CECONY and O R are authorized to incur costs of 17.1 million and 4.6 million, respectively, through the completion of Stage 2 (Pilot Project Engineering Design and Customer Protection Plan). These projected costs are within the budgets proposed by CECONY and O R of 255 million and 46 million, respectively. The remaining proposed budget amounts are subject to approval by the NYSPSC. In May 2024, CECONY filed a petition with the NYSDPS seeking 6 million for certain unaddressed costs that are necessary to complete Stage 2 of its utility thermal energy network pilot projects, in addition to the 17.1 million described above. 
 
 Superfund 
 Gowanus Canal 
 The EPA has identified 39 potentially responsible parties (PRPs) with respect to the Gowanus Canal Superfund Site, including CECONY (which the EPA indicated has facilities that may be a source of PCBs at the site). Certain federal agencies and the NYSDEC also notified potentially responsible parties (PRPs), including CECONY, of their intent to perform a natural resource damage assessment for the Gowanus Canal Superfund Site. 
 
 In March 2024, CECONY received a notice that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the NYSDEC, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (collectively, the Trustees published a Draft Natural Resource Assessment Plan, indicating that the Trustees are conducting a natural resource damage assessment to determine, among other things, the appropriate amount and type of projects needed to restore, replace, or acquire the equivalent of injured natural resources at the Gowanus Canal Superfund Site. 
 
 In June 2024, the EPA issued an order amending its January 2020 order and that requires six PRPs, including CECONY, to initiate remedial action work in the middle segment of the Gowanus Canal Superfund Site. The EPA estimated the cost of this work would be 369 million (although actual costs may be significantly higher) and has indicated the work would take several years to complete. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, dredging and stabilization was largely completed in the upper segment of the Gowanus Canal Superfund Site, as set forth in the January 2020 order, at a cost of approximately 260 million. 
 
 In October 2024, a PRP filed a lawsuit against the other PRPs, including CECONY, with respect to the Gowanus Canal Superfund Site. The plaintiff asserts claims pursuant to the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and the New York Navigation Law for cleanup costs incurred, and to be incurred, by the plaintiff at the site. 
 
 CECONY is unable to estimate its exposure to liability for the Gowanus Canal Superfund Site. 

Other Environmental Matters 
 In April 2024, a CECONY feeder in the Bronx leaked resulting in a release of approximately one thousand gallons of dielectric fluid (a non-toxic synthetic compound similar to mineral oil), a portion of which migrated to a nearby sewer system and a sheen was seen in the Bronx River. CECONY stopped the feeder leak and began the cleanup on the same day the discharge occurred. CECONY, with assistance from the NYSDEC, also placed booms in the Bronx River at various locations to collect any fluid that made it to the river through the sewer system. CECONY is addressing the remaining sheen on the river, and also voluntarily cleaned up a significant amount of debris and trash in the area of the oil sheen. In April 2024, CECONY also discovered the presence of oil in the Hudson River within the permanent containment boom surrounding Pier 98 that likely originated from an internal leak of approximately 4,400 gallons of oil at CECONY s steam generating plant on 59th Street in Manhattan. CECONY immediately installed an additional containment boom and an absorbent boom in the Hudson River and has estimated that 72 gallons of oil was released to the river. The U.S. Coast Guard, the New York City Department of 
 79 

Environmental Protection, and the NYSDEC were notified and oversaw the clean-up operations. The costs associated with these matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on CECONY s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. In connection with the incidents, CECONY may incur monetary sanctions from government agencies of more than 0.3 million for violations of certain provisions regulating the discharge of materials into, and for the protection of, the environment. 
 
 For additional information about the Companies environmental matters, see Note G to the Third Quarter Financial Statements. 
 
 Electric Reliability Needs 
 CECONY and O R monitor the adequacy of the electric capacity resources and related developments in their service areas, and work with other parties on long-term resource adequacy and transmission security within the framework of the NYISO reliability planning process. CECONY has identified and developed a solution for a local reliability need that may begin as soon as the summer of 2026. In October 2024, the NYISO issued its 2024 Reliability Needs Assessment (RNA) that identifies a bulk power system electric reliability need in New York City beginning in the summer of 2033 primarily driven by forecasted increases in peak demand and the assumed retirement of NYPA small gas generating plants as required by New York State law. Following approval of the 2024 RNA by the NYISO board, the NYISO is expected to issue a solicitation for both market-based and regulated solutions. CECONY, as the Responsible Transmission Owner, would propose a regulated backstop solution . 

Con Edison Transmission 
 Con Edison Transmission owns a 45.7 percent interest in New York Transco that is comprised of: a 45.7 percent interest in New York Transco's Transmission Owner Transmission Solutions (TOTS) projects; a 45.7 percent interest in New York Transco s New York Energy Solution (NYES) project; and a 41.7 percent interest in New York Transco s share of the Propel NY Energy project. Con Edison Transmission also owns a 71.2 percent interest in Honeoye Storage Corporation Honeoye) and its interest in Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC (MVP) is expected to be approxim ately 6.6 percent. See Environmental Matters - Clean Energy Future - New York State s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, above. 
 
 In June 2024, construction of the Dover Station, an additional network upgrade to support the NYES project, resumed following the reissuance of its permits. Construction is anticipated to be completed by June 2025. 

Financial and Commodity Market Risks 
 The Companies are subject to various risks and uncertainties associated with financial and commodity markets. The most significant market risks include interest rate risk, commodity price risk and investment risk. 

Interest Rate Risk 
 The Companies' interest rate risk primarily relates to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including the construction expenditures of the Utilities and maturing debt securities, and variable-rate debt. Con Edison and its subsidiaries manage interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt. Con Edison and CECONY estimate that at September 30, 2024, a 10 percent increase in interest rates applicable to its variable rate debt would result in an increase in annual interest expen se of 12 million and 10 million, respectively. Un der CECONY s current electric, gas and steam rate plans, variations in actual variable rate tax-exempt debt interest expense, including costs associated with the refinancing of the variable rate tax-exempt debt, are reconciled to levels reflected in rates. 
 
 Higher interest rates have resulted in increased interest expense on commercial paper, variable-rate debt and long-term debt issuances. 

Commodity Price Risk 
 Con Edison s commodity price risk primarily relates to the purchase and sale of electricity, gas and related derivative instruments. The Utilities apply risk management strategies to mitigate their related exposures. See Note N to the Third Quarter Financial Statements. 

80 

Con Edison estimates that, as of September 30, 2024, a 10 percent decline in market prices would result in a decline in fair value of 148 million for the derivative instruments used by the Utilities to hedge purchases of electricity and gas, of which 136 million is for CECONY and 12 million is for O R. As of September 30, 2023, Con Edison estimated that a 10 percent decline in market prices would result in a decline in fair value of 177 million for the derivative instruments used by the Utilities to hedge purchases of electricity and gas, of which 165 million is for CECONY and 12 million is for O R. Con Edison expects that any such change in fair value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased. 
 
 The Utilities do not make any margin or profit on the electricity or gas they sell. In accordance with provisions approved by state regulators, the Utilities generally recover from full-service customers the costs they incur for energy purchased for those customers, including gains and losses on certain derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchased and related costs. However, increases in electric and gas commodity prices may contribute to a slower recovery of cash from outstanding customer accounts receivable balances. 

Investment Risk 
 The Companies investment risk relates to the investment of plan assets for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Con Edison's investment risk also relates to the investments of Con Edison Transmission that are accounted for under the equity method. See "Investments" in Note A to the Third Quarter Financial Statements. 
 
 The Companies current investment policy for pension plan assets includes investment targets of 26 to 30 percent equity securities, 42 to 60 percent debt securities and 14 to 30 percent alternatives. At September 30, 2024, the pension plan investments consisted of 28 percent equity securities, 51 percent debt securities and 21 percent alternatives. 
 
 For the Utilities pension and other postretirement benefit plans, regulatory accounting treatment is generally applied in accordance with the accounting rules for regulated operations. In accordance with the Statement of Policy issued by the NYSPSC and its current electric, gas and steam rate plans, CECONY defers for payment to or recovery from customers the difference between the pension and other postretirement benefit expenses and the amounts for such expenses reflected in rates. O R also defers such difference pursuant to its New York rate plans. 

Material Contingencies 
 For information concerning potential liabilities arising from the Companies material contingencies, see "Other Regulatory Matters" in Note B and Notes G and H to the Third Quarter Financial Statements. 

Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 For information about the Companies primary market risks associated with activities in derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments, see Financial and Commodity Market Risks, in Part I, Item 2 of this report, that is incorporated herein by reference. 

Item 4: Controls and Procedures 
 The Companies maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that they submit to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. For each of the Companies, its management, with the participation of its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated its disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report and, based on such evaluation, has concluded that the controls and procedures are effective to provide such reasonable assurance. Reasonable assurance is not absolute assurance, however, and there can be no assurance that any design of controls or procedures would be effective under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. 
 There was no change in the Companies internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Companies most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companies internal control over financial reporting.
