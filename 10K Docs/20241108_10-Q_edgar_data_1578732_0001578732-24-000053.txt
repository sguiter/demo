 The Company invests its excess cash in a diversified portfolio of fixed and variable rate debt securities to meet current and future cash flow needs. All investments are made in accordance with the Company s approved investment policy. As of September 30, 2024, the portfolio had a weighted average credit rating of A+ and a weighted term to contractual maturity of years. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had securities in the portfolio representing an unrealized aggregate loss of million, or of amortized cost, and a weighted average credit rating of A+. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company performed an impairment analysis and determined an allowance for credit losses was not required. The Company determined that it did not have an intent to sell and it was not more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell any security based on its current liquidity position, or to maintain compliance with its investment policy, specifically as it relates to minimum credit ratings. The Company evaluated the securities with an unrealized loss considering severity of loss, credit ratings, specific credit events during the period since acquisition, overall likelihood of default, market sector, potential impact from the current economic environment, including interest rates, geopolitical unrest and a review of an issuer s and securities liquidity and financial strength, as needed. The Company concluded that it would receive all scheduled interest and principal payments. The Company, therefore, determined qualitatively that the unrealized loss was related to changes in interest rates and other market factors and therefore no allowance for credit losses was required.

 Deferred Compensation Liability 
 A select group of management is eligible to participate in the Marcus Millichap Deferred Compensation Plan (the Deferred Compensation Plan ). The Deferred Compensation Plan is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan that is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and permits participants to defer compensation up to the limits set forth in the Deferred Compensation Plan. Amounts are paid out generally when the participant is no longer a service provider; however, an in-service payout election is available to participants. Participants may elect to receive payouts as a lump sum or quarterly over a two to period.

 Awards Granted and Settled 
 Under the Amended Plan, the Company has issued RSAs to non-employee directors and restricted stock units RSUs to employees and independent contractors. RSAs vest over a period from the date of grant, subject to service requirements. RSUs generally vest in equal annual installments over a period from the date of grant or earlier as approved by the Compensation Committee. Dividend equivalents granted for unvested stock awards are paid at the time the stock awards vest. Any unvested awards and dividend equivalents are forfeited upon termination as a service provider. As of September 30, 2024, there were issued or outstanding options, SARs, performance units or performance share awards under the Amended Plan. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, RSUs and RSAs vested, with shares of common stock withheld to pay applicable required employee statutory withholding taxes based on the market value of the shares on the vesting date. The shares withheld for taxes were returned to the share reserve and are available for future issuance in accordance with provisions of the Amended Plan.

 Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
 In 2013, the Company adopted the 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP ). The ESPP is intended to qualify under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code and provides for consecutive, non-overlapping offering periods. The offering periods generally start on the first trading day on or after May 15 and November 15 of each year. Qualifying employees may purchase shares of the Company stock at a discount based on the lower of the market price at the beginning or end of the offering period, subject to Internal Revenue Service IRS limitations. The Company determined that the ESPP was a compensatory plan and is required to expense the fair value of the awards over each offering period. 
 In October 2023 and February 2024, the Board of Directors amended the ESPP to (i) eliminate the term of the ESPP such that the ESPP shall continue in effect until the ESPP is terminated by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee, (ii) eliminate the evergreen feature providing for annual increases in the number of shares reserved for issuance under the ESPP without stockholder approval, (iii) increase the discount qualifying employees may purchase

 Overview 
 We are a leading national real estate services firm specializing in commercial real estate investment sales, financing services, research and advisory services. We have been the top commercial real estate investment broker in the United States based on the number of investment transactions for more than 15 years. As of September 30, 2024, we had 1,678 investment sales and financing professionals that are primarily exclusive independent contractors operating in more than 80 offices, who provide real estate brokerage and financing services to sellers and buyers of commercial real estate assets. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we closed 1,987 and 5,351 investment sales, financing and other transactions with total sales volume of approximately 12.0 billion and 31.2 billion, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we closed 7,546 investment sales, financing and other transactions with total sales volume of approximately 43.6 billion. 
 We generate revenue by collecting real estate brokerage commissions upon the sale, and financing fees upon the financing of commercial properties, by providing equity advisory services and loan sales, loan guarantees and by providing leasing, consulting and advisory services. Real estate brokerage commissions are typically based upon the value of the property and financing fees are typically based upon the size of the loan. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 84 of our revenue was generated from real estate brokerage commissions, 12 from financing fees and 4 from other real estate related services. 
 We divide commercial real estate into four major markets, characterized by price: 
 Properties priced less than 1 million; 
 Private client market: properties priced from 1 million to up to but less than 10 million; 
 Middle market: properties priced from 10 million to up to but less than 20 million; and 
 Larger transaction market: properties priced from 20 million and above. 
 We are the industry leader in serving private clients in the 1 million - 10 million private client market, which contributed approximately 62 and 65 of our real estate brokerage commissions during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and approximately 63 and 67 of our real estate brokerage commissions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The following tables set forth the number of transactions, sales volume and revenue by each commercial real estate market for real estate brokerage:

 We believe this combination of economic trends will generate modestly positive economic growth through the remainder of 2024 and into 2025, but the growth is not expected to be substantial enough to reignite inflation. 
 Both the headline Consumer Price Index CPI inflation metric and the Personal Consumption Expenditure PCE index have sustained downward momentum, with CPI registering 2.4 and PCE reading 2.1 in September. While these trends have been positive, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation metric, the core Personal Consumption Expenditure, has proven more sticky, hovering in the 2.6 to 2.7 range for five consecutive months. Following the 50 basis point rate cut in September and 25 basis point rate cut in November by the Federal Reserve, Wall Street metrics suggest the Federal Reserve will further reduce rates by 25 basis points at their next meeting. We believe that such a move could positively impact investor sentiment and bolster the flow of capital into commercial real estate. 
 Commercial Real Estate Supply and Demand 
 Our business is dependent on the willingness of investors to invest in or sell commercial real estate, which is affected by many factors beyond our control. These factors include the supply of commercial real estate, coupled with user demand for these properties, and the performance of real estate assets, when compared with other investment alternatives, such as stocks and bonds. 
 All four major property types demonstrated positive space demand in the third quarter of 2024, although each demonstrated unique nuances. Over 191,000 net apartment units were filled in the quarter, the strongest quarterly results since 2021. The demand modestly outpaced the record-level 163,000 apartment completions delivered in the quarter to reduce vacancy by 20 basis points to 5.6 . Robust apartment demand outpaced expectations and bolstered multifamily investor confidence. 
 The industrial vacancy rate increased in the third quarter of 2024 as elevated construction exceeded space demand of 22 million square feet. Industrial completions have been highly concentrated, with about half of the additions being delivered in seven metros areas. Although many retailers increased their inventories in anticipation of the east coast dockworker strike, warehouse industrial space needs have tapered significantly over the last two years. Retail vacancy rates remain near a record-low, with space absorption being restricted by limited space availability and nominal construction levels. Office vacancy rates decreased by 20 basis points to 17.0 on positive absorption of 26 million square feet, the strongest quarterly office space demand since 2021. Nonetheless, the office performance outlook remains in question as it is unclear when or if a sizable portion of workers will return permanently to the office. 
 Although the fundamentals of most property types remain sound, with the notable exception of urban office properties, both lending and investor activity remain below the pre-pandemic historical norm. The expectation gap between buyers and sellers has narrowed slightly, particularly after the Federal Reserve reduced rates in September, but the gap remains challenging. The demand for space will continue to be influenced by consumer and business sentiment as well as the broader economic outlook. However, should the Federal Reserve reduce rates in the fourth quarter, as expected, sentiment could continue to strengthen and space demand could increase. 
 Capital Markets 
 Credit and liquidity issues in the financial markets have a direct impact on the flow of capital to the commercial real estate market. Real estate purchases are often financed with debt, and as a result, credit and liquidity impact transaction activity and prices. Movements of interest rates in one direction, whether increasing or decreasing, could adversely or positively affect the operations and income potential of commercial real estate properties, as well as lender and equity underwriting for real estate investments. These changes directly influence investor demand for commercial real estate investments and what they are willing to pay. Furthermore, the use of debt or loan-to-value ratios can shift along with lender confidence and underwriting standards. At times of heightened uncertainty or liquidity issues, loan-to-values decline, requiring buyers to provide more equity and take more risk to close deals. 
 The capital markets remain at the heart of the commercial real estate transaction slowdown over the last two years. The combination of sustained higher interest rates with tighter lender underwriting, reduced loan-to-value standards and a broad-based reduction in the volume of available debt capital have restrained market liquidity. This has forced investors to recalibrate their underwriting. This widened the buyer/seller expectation gap and reduced trading throughout 2023 and thus far in 2024. 
 31 

Table of Contents 

 The 50 basis point rate reduction by the Federal Reserve in September improved investor sentiment, but the increase of the 10-year treasury rate following the rate cut has negatively impacted borrowing rates. Nonetheless, we believe that the sustained downward pressure on interest rates over the next year anticipated by most investors will ultimately occur, and many investors have reinitiated preliminary actions that may ultimately lead to transaction activity. At present, FedWatch has assigned a high likelihood that the Federal Reserve overnight rate will be in the 4.25 -4.5 range by year-end. However, numerous variables including the election, global geopolitical forces, job creation trends and other economic readings could still sway those expectations. Despite the broad consensus that the Federal Reserve will continue to reduce rates, there can be no certainty until each reduction takes place. 
 Investor Sentiment and Investment Activity 
 We facilitate investors buying, selling, and financing properties in order to generate commissions. Investors desires and need to engage in real estate transactions are dependent on many factors that are beyond our control. The economy, supply and demand for properly positioned properties, available credit and market events impact investor sentiment and, therefore, transaction velocity. In addition, our private clients, who make up the largest source of revenue, are often motivated to buy, sell and/or refinance properties due to personal circumstances, such as death, divorce, partnership breakups and estate planning. 
 The commercial real estate sector once again saw below average sales activity in the third quarter as investors contended with persistent headwinds including still-elevated interest rates, tightened lender underwriting and the buyer/seller expectation gap. Although some signs of recovery have emerged, including more exclusive inventory being brought to market, a sustainable recovery in trading volumes has yet to occur. We believe a significant volume of investment capital remains un-deployed waiting for economic, interest rate, financial market, geopolitical and commercial real estate pricing clarity. Should the Federal Reserve continue to reduce rates, it would support positive momentum, but finalizing the transaction process will take additional time. 
 Office properties, particularly those in the urban core, continue to face the greatest uncertainty and the greatest challenges in acquiring debt financing. In addition, signs of distress and the potential for additional foreclosures in this commercial real estate segment continue to rise. Apartment financing, underpinned by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, has generally been the most attainable, with typically lower interest rates than other property types. However, the rapid interest rate spike relative to the sector's very low cap rates and the large apartment development pipeline together with still-modest rent growth has impacted apartment sales. Defensive assets, such as single-tenant net lease properties backed by high-credit tenants, and medical office assets continue to receive buyer interest, but sales of these types of properties have also fallen as the flow of 1031 exchange capital coming from other property types has diminished. Ultimately, the market velocity will be dictated by a combination of the economic outlook, geopolitical forces, Federal Reserve action, interest rates and the narrowing of the buyer/seller expectation gap. As downward pressure on interest rates is applied, we believe commercial real estate investment activity could gain momentum. 
 
 Key Financial Measures and Indicators 
 Revenue 
 Our revenue is primarily generated from our real estate investment sales business. In addition to real estate brokerage commissions, we generate revenue from financing fees and from other revenue, which are primarily comprised of leasing, consulting and advisory fees. 
 Because our business is transaction oriented, we rely on investment sales and financing professionals to continually develop leads, identify properties to sell and finance, market those properties and close the sale timely to generate a consistent flow of revenue. While our sales volume is impacted by seasonality factors, the timing of closings is also dependent on many market and personal factors unique to a particular client or transaction, particularly clients transacting in the 1 million to 10 million private client market. These factors can cause transactions to be accelerated or delayed beyond our control. Further, commission rates earned are generally inversely related to the value of the property sold. As a result of our expansion into the middle and larger transaction markets, we have seen our overall commission rates fluctuate from period-to-period as a result of changes in the relative mix of the number and volume of investment sales transactions closed in the middle and larger transaction markets as compared to the 1 million to 10 million private client market. These factors may result in period-to-period variations in our revenue that differ from historical patterns. 
 A small percentage of our transactions include retainer fees and/or breakage fees. Retainer fees are credited against a success-based fee paid upon the closing of a transaction or a breakage fee. Transactions that are terminated before 
 32 

Table of Contents 

 completion will sometimes generate breakage fees, which are usually calculated as a set amount or a percentage of the fee we would have received had the transaction closed. 
 Real Estate Brokerage Commissions 
 We earn real estate brokerage commissions by acting as a broker for commercial real estate owners seeking to sell or investors seeking to buy properties. Revenue from real estate brokerage commissions is recognized at the close of escrow. 
 Financing Fees 
 We earn financing fees by securing financing on purchase transactions or by securing refinancing of our clients existing mortgage debt. We recognize financing fee revenue at the time the loan closes, and we have no remaining significant obligations in connection with the transaction. 
 To a lesser extent, we also earn fees on loan performance, equity advisory services, loan sales, loan guarantees and ancillary services associated with financing activities. We recognize guarantee fees over the term of the guarantee and other fees when we have no further performance obligations, generally upon the closing of a transaction. 
 Other Revenue 
 Other revenue includes fees generated from leasing, consulting and advisory services, as well as referral fees from other real estate brokers, and are recognized when services are provided, upon closing of the transaction or when we have no further performance obligations. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses consist of cost of services, selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization. The significant components of our expenses are further described below. 
 Cost of Services 
 The majority of our cost of services expense is variable commissions paid to our investment sales and financing professionals and compensation-related costs related to our financing activities. Commission expenses are directly attributable to providing services to our clients for investment sales and financing services. Most of our investment sales and financing professionals are independent contractors and are paid commissions; however, because there are some who are initially paid a salary and certain of our financing professionals are employees, costs of services also include employee-related compensation, employer taxes and benefits for those employees. The commission rates we pay to our investment sales and financing professionals vary based on individual contracts negotiated and are generally higher for the more experienced professionals. Some of our most senior investment sales and financing professionals can also earn additional commissions after meeting certain annual financial thresholds. These additional commissions are recognized as cost of services in the period in which they are earned. Payment of a portion of these additional commissions are generally deferred for a period of three years, at our election, and paid at the end of the third calendar year. Cost of services also includes referral fees paid to other real estate brokers where we are the principal service provider. Cost of services, therefore, can vary based on the commission structure of the independent contractors that closed transactions in any particular period. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 The largest expense component within selling, general and administrative expenses is personnel expenses for our management team and sales and support staff, as well as business development, marketing, and expensing of forgivable loans over the retention period of our sales and financing professionals. In addition, these costs include facilities costs (excluding depreciation and amortization), staff related expenses, sales, marketing, legal, telecommunication, network, data sources, changes in fair value for contingent and deferred consideration and other administrative expenses. Also included in selling, general and administrative are expenses for stock-based compensation to non-employee directors, employees and independent contractors (i.e. investment sales and financing professionals) under the Amended and Restated 2013 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the Amended Plan and the Amended and Restated 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the Amended ESPP ).

 Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
 Depreciation expense consists of depreciation recorded on our computer software and hardware, as well as our furniture, fixtures and equipment. Depreciation is recognized over estimated useful lives ranging from three to seven years for assets. Amortization expense consists of amortization recorded on intangible assets amortized on a straight-line basis using a useful life between one and seven years. 
 Other Income, Net 
 Other income, net primarily consists of interest income, realized gains and losses on our marketable debt securities, available-for-sale, net gains or losses on our deferred compensation plan assets, foreign currency gains and losses and other non-operating income and expenses. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense primarily consists of interest expense associated with the stock appreciation rights SARs liability, and our credit agreement.

 We are subject to U.S. and Canadian federal taxes and individual state and local taxes based on the income generated in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our effective tax rate fluctuates as a result of (i) changes in our annual effective tax rate applied to current pre-tax income (loss), (ii) the change in the mix of our activities in the jurisdictions in which we operate due to differing tax rates in those jurisdictions and (iii) the impact of permanent items, including compensation charges, qualified transportation fringe benefits, uncertain tax positions, meals and entertainment and tax-exempt deferred compensation plan assets. Our benefit for income taxes includes the windfall tax benefits and shortfall expenses, net, from shares issued in connection with our Amended Plan and Amended ESPP. 
 We record deferred taxes, net based on the tax rate expected to be in effect at the time those items are expected to be recognized for tax purposes. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 The following is a discussion of our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The tables included in the period comparisons below provide summaries of our results of operations. The period-to-period comparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results. 
 Key Operating Metrics 
 We regularly review a number of key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. We also believe these metrics are relevant to investors and others assessment of our financial condition and results of operations. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we closed 1,987 and 1,846 investment sales, financing and other transactions, respectively, with total sales volume of approximately 12.0 billion and 11.4 billion, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we closed 5,351 and 5,599 investment sales, financing and other transactions,

For a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, which is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, see Non-GAAP Financial Measure below. 
 Revenue 
 Total revenue was 168.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 162.0 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 6.5 million, or 4.0 . Total revenue increased as a result of increases in real estate brokerage commissions, financing fees and other revenue, as described below. See Factors Affecting Our Business for additional market information. 
 Real estate brokerage commissions. Revenue from real estate brokerage commissions increased to 142.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 139.8 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 2.2 million, or 1.5 . The increase was the result of total sales volume increasing by 14.7 , partially offset by a reduction of 22 basis points in the average commission rate earned during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Private Client Market revenue decreased by 4.3 , while the combined Middle Market and Larger Transaction Market revenue increased by 15.1 . 
 Financing fees . Revenue from financing fees increased to 20.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 17.3 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 3.3 million, or 19.3 , resulting primarily from a 12.0 increase in total financing volume and a two basis point increase in the average fee rate during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Other revenue . Other revenue increased to 6.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.0 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 1.0 million, or 20.3 , resulting primarily from an increase in consulting fees.

 Total Operating Expenses 
 Total operating expenses were 180.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 177.5 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 2.5 million, or 1.4 . The change was primarily due to an increase of 1.5 million in selling, general, and administrative expenses as described below. 
 Cost of services. Cost of services are variable commissions paid to our investment sales professionals and compensation-related costs in connection with our financing activities. Cost of services slightly increased to 104.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 104.6 million for the same period in 2023. Cost of services as a percentage of total revenue decreased by 240 basis points to 62.2 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to our senior investment sales and financing professionals earning a lower amount of additional commissions. 
 Selling, general, and administrative expense. Selling, general and administrative expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 70.7 million, from 69.2 million compared to the same period in 2023, an increase of 1.5 million or 2.1 . The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs, partially offset by a reduction in marketing support costs provided to our investment sales and financing professionals. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to 4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.6 million compared to the same period in 2023, an increase of 0.9 million, or 25.1 . The increase primarily relates to accelerated amortization of certain intangible assets resulting from changes in estimates. 
 Other Income, Net 
 Other income, net increased to 5.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.4 million for the same period in 2023. The increase of 0.9 million was primarily driven by an increase in the carrying value of the assets held in the rabbi trust. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense decreased by an immaterial amount for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, and primarily relates to interest expense on the Company s SARs liability. 
 Benefit for Income Taxes 
 The benefit for income taxes was 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.0 million for the same period in 2023. The effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 15.2 compared to 17.8 for the same period in 2023. The net decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the relationship of permanent and other items, the change in the valuation allowance and the change in the state income tax benefit to pre-tax loss as presented in Note 10 Income Taxes in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1, Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 Revenue 
 Total revenue was 456.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 479.7 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 23.7 million, or 4.9 . Total revenue decreased as a result of a decrease in real estate brokerage commissions, partially offset by increases in financing fees and other revenue, as described below. See Factors Affecting Our Business for additional market information. 
 Real estate brokerage commissions. Revenue from real estate brokerage commissions decreased to 386.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 415.2 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 28.3 million, or 6.8 . The decrease was the result of total sales volume decreasing by 3.4 and a reduction of seven basis points in the average commission rate earned for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Private Client Market revenue decreased by 11.8 , while the combined Middle Market and Larger Transaction Market increased by 3.6 . 
 Financing fees . Revenue from financing fees increased to 53.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 51.0 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 2.3 million, or 4.5 , resulting primarily from a 6.5 increase in total financing volume, partially offset by a decrease of six basis points in the average fee rate. 
 Other revenue . Other revenue increased to 15.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 13.5 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 2.3 million, or 17.4 . The increase was primarily driven by increases in leasing fees during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023.

 Total Operating Expenses 
 Our total operating expenses were 495.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 521.9 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 26.3 million, or 5.0 . Cost of services decreased by 21.5 million and selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased by 5.7 million, as described below. 
 Cost of services. Cost of services are variable commissions paid to our investment sales professionals and compensation-related costs in connection with our financing activities. Cost of services decreased to 279.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 301.2 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 21.5 million, or 7.1 . The decrease was primarily due to decreased commission expenses driven by the related decreased revenue noted above. Cost of services as a percentage of total revenue decreased by 150 basis points to 61.3 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to our senior investment sales and financing professionals earning a lower amount of additional commissions due to lower revenue. 
 Selling, general, and administrative expense. Selling, general and administrative expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 204.6 million, from 210.3 million compared to the same period in the prior year, a decrease of 5.7 million or 2.7 . The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in marketing support costs provided to our investment sales and financing professionals, partially offset by an increase in compensation-related costs. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to 11.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 10.3 million compared to the same period in 2023, an increase of 1.0 million, or 9.6 . The increase primarily relates to accelerated amortization of certain intangible assets resulting from changes in estimates. 
 Other Income, Net 
 Other income, net increased to 15.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 14.1 million for the same period in 2023. The increase of 1.6 million was primarily driven by increase in interest income as a result of rebalancing the Company's investments to take advantage of higher yields and an increase in the carrying value of the assets held in the rabbi trust. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense decreased by an immaterial amount for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, and primarily relates to interest expense on the Company s SARs liability. 
 Benefit for Income Taxes 
 The benefit for income taxes was 3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.9 million for the same period in 2023. The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 14.7 compared to 17.1 for the same period in 2023. The effective income tax rate decreased primarily due to the relationship of permanent nondeductible items to projected pre-tax loss for the full year as the impact to the effective tax rate that were caused by other items were largely offsetting. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measure 
 In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we include a non-GAAP financial measure, Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss before (i) interest income and other, including net realized gains (losses) on marketable debt securities, available-for-sale and cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, (ii) interest expense, (iii) benefit for income taxes, (iv) depreciation and amortization, and (v) stock-based compensation. We use Adjusted EBITDA in our business operations to evaluate the performance of our business, develop budgets and measure our performance against those budgets, among other things. We also believe that analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate our overall operating performance. However, Adjusted EBITDA has material limitations as a supplemental metric and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. We find Adjusted EBITDA to be a useful management metric to assist in evaluating performance, because Adjusted EBITDA eliminates items related to capital structure, taxes and non-cash items. In light of the foregoing limitations, we do not rely solely on Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure and also consider our U.S. GAAP results. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of our financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net loss, operating income or any other measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because

 Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated in the same manner by all companies, it may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, net loss, to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows (in thousands):

 (1) Other includes net realized losses on marketable debt securities, available-for-sale. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, cash flows from operations, marketable debt securities, available-for-sale and, if necessary, borrowings under our Credit Agreement (as defined herein). In order to enhance yield to us, we have invested a portion of our cash in money market funds and fixed and variable income debt securities, in accordance with our investment policy approved by the Board of Directors. Certain of our investments in money market funds may not maintain a stable net asset value and may impose a discretionary liquidity fee. To date, the Company has not experienced any restrictions on its ability to redeem funds from money market funds. Although we have historically funded our operations through operating cash flows, there can be no assurance that we can continue to meet our cash requirements entirely through our operations, cash, net of restricted cash, cash equivalents, and proceeds from the sale of marketable debt securities, available-for-sale or availability under our Credit Agreement. 
 Cash Flows 
 Our total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balance increased by 1.9 million to 172.7 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 170.8 million at December 31, 2023. The following table sets forth our summary cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash flows used in operating activities (34,941) (87,114) Net cash flows provided by investing activities 55,307 128,733 Net cash flows used in financing activities (18,346) (53,318) Effect of currency exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (56) Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 1,964 (11,699) Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at beginning of period 170,753 235,873 Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at end of period 172,717 224,174 
 Operating Activities 
 Cash flows used in operating activities were 34.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 87.1 million for the same period in 2023. The 52.2 million decrease in cash flows used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to decreased payments for bonuses and deferred compensation and commissions in the current year compared to the same period in prior year. The larger bonus and commission payments made in the 2023 period primarily related to amounts accrued in 2022. The cash flows from operating activities are also affected by the timing of certain cash receipts and payments.

 Investing Activities 
 Cash flows provided by investing activities were 55.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 128.7 million for the same period in 2023. The 73.4 million decrease in cash flows provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to a net decrease of 74.9 million in net proceeds from sales and maturities of securities in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Net proceeds from marketable debt securities, available-for-sale during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 were used to fund operations, dividends and stock repurchases. 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash flows used in financing activities were 18.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 53.3 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease of 35.0 million in cash flows used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to a decrease of 34.4 million in stock repurchases in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Liquidity 
 We believe that our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, cash flows expected to be generated from our operations, and proceeds from the sale of marketable debt securities, available-for-sale will be sufficient to satisfy our operating requirements for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. If we need to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings, strategic relationships or other arrangements, this capital might not be available to us in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise sufficient capital when needed could prevent us from funding acquisitions or otherwise financing our growth or operations. As of September 30, 2024, cash, excluding restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities, available-for-sale, aggregated 338.3 million. 
 Credit Agreement 
 Our credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (as amended, the Credit Agreement provides for a 10.0 million principal amount senior secured revolving credit facility that is guaranteed by all of our domestic subsidiaries and matures on June 1, 2025. The Company maintains a 10.0 million restricted cash balance in support of the Credit Agreement. The Company is monitoring covenant compliance on a regular basis to ensure continued compliance with the Credit Agreement. Our ability to borrow under our Credit Agreement is limited by our ability to comply with its covenants or obtain necessary waivers. See Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies of our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1, Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on the Credit Agreement. 
 
 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 The Company, in connection with the Strategic Alliance with M T Realty Capital Corporation MTRCC ), has agreed to provide loan opportunities that may be funded through MTRCC s agreement with Fannie Mae, which requires MTRCC to guarantee a portion of each funded loan. On a loan-by-loan basis, the Company, at its option, can assume a portion of MTRCC s guarantee obligation to Fannie Mae of loan opportunities presented to and closed by MTRCC. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has agreed to a maximum aggregate guarantee obligation of 226.0 million relating to loans with an unpaid balance of 1,356.3 million. The maximum guarantee obligation is not representative of the actual loss we would incur. The Company would be liable for this amount only if all of the loans for which it is providing a guarantee to MTRCC were to default and all of the collateral underlying these loans was determined to be without value at the time of settlement. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has recorded an allowance for loss-sharing obligations of 1,222,000 and pledged 678,000 in a restricted bank account in support of the guarantee obligation. 
 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 There have been no material changes in our commitments under contractual obligations, as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 through the date the condensed consolidated financial statements were issued, other than commitments that are already disclosed in the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements.

 Inflation 
 Our commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by real estate market supply and demand, which may be affected by uncertain or changing economic and market conditions, including inflation/deflation arising in connection with and in response to various macroeconomic factors and impact of increased interest rates on the broader economy. 
 The annual CPI inflation rate in the U.S. peaked at 9.1 in June 2022, the highest annual inflation rate since November 1981, then fell to 3.1 in November 2023. In the first quarter of 2024, the headline CPI inflation rate trended upward to a reading of 3.5 in March 2024, but it has since been reduced to 2.4 and most economists believe that the current trend will continue. In 2022 through 2023, the Federal Reserve increased the federal funds rate to the 5.25 -5.5 range in an effort to combat inflation, which has had an adverse impact on commercial real estate transactions. The inflation volatility in the first quarter of 2024 raised questions about whether and when the Federal Reserve will reduce interest rates. At the beginning of the year, there were broad expectations that the Federal Reserve would make several rate cuts in 2024, but expectations have been pared back. The significant 50 basis point reduction of the overnight rate in September was positively received by investors, boosting sentiment, but questions about the pace of future reductions remain. The volatility of the 10-year treasury rate following the Federal Reserve's overnight interest rate reduction remains a headwind for investors, but many investors have reinitiated preliminary transactional activity such as requesting broker opinions of value and touring assets as they reassess the market. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In applying many of these accounting principles, we make assumptions, estimates and/or judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in our condensed consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These assumptions, estimates and/or judgments, however, are often subjective and our actual results may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analyses. If actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. There were no significant changes in our critical accounting policies, as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024.

 We maintain a portfolio of investments in a variety of fixed and variable debt rate securities, including U.S. Treasuries, U.S. government sponsored entities, corporate debt, asset-backed securities and others. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of investments in marketable debt securities, available-for-sale was 176.3 million. The primary objective of our investment activity is to maintain the safety of principal and to provide for future liquidity requirements while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. While some investments may be securities of companies in foreign countries, all investments are denominated and payable in U.S. dollars. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. While our intent is not to sell these investment securities prior to their stated maturities, we may choose to sell any of the securities for strategic reasons including, but not limited to, anticipated capital requirements, anticipation of credit deterioration, duration management, yield management and because a security no longer meets the criteria of our investment policy. We do not use derivatives or similar instruments to manage our interest rate risk. We seek to invest in high quality investments. The weighted average credit rating of our portfolio investments (exclusive of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash) was A+ as of September 30, 2024. Maturities are maintained consistent with our short-, medium- and long-term liquidity objectives. 
 Currently, our portfolio of investments predominantly consists of fixed interest rate debt securities; however, a portion of our investment portfolio may consist of variable interest rate debt securities. Our investments in fixed interest rate debt securities are subject to various market risks. Changes in prevailing interest rates may adversely or positively impact their fair market value should interest rates generally rise or fall. Accordingly, we also may have interest rate risk with variable interest rate debt securities as the income produced may decrease if interest rates fall. Contraction in market liquidity may adversely affect the value of portions of our portfolio and affect our ability to sell securities in the time frames required and at acceptable prices. Uncertainty in future market conditions may raise market participant s expectations of returns, thus impacting the value of securities in our portfolio as well. The following table sets forth the

 impact on the fair value of our investments as of September 30, 2024 from changes in interest rates based on the weighted average duration of the debt securities in our portfolio (in thousands): 
 Change in Interest Rates Approximate Change in Fair Value of Investments Increase (Decrease) 2 Decrease .................. 3,529 1 Decrease .................. 1,764 1 Increase .................. (1,764) 2 Increase .................. (3,527) 
 Due to the nature of our business and the manner in which we conduct our operations, we believe we do not face any material interest rate risk with respect to other assets and liabilities, equity price risk or other market risks. The functional currency of our Canadian operations is the Canadian dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk for the settlement of transactions of the Canadian operations as well as unrealized translation adjustments. Historically foreign exchange rate risk has not been material. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f), including maintenance of (i) records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets, and (ii) policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance that (a) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, (b) our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our Board of Directors, and (c) we will prevent or timely detect unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Our management, with the supervision and participation of our chief executive officer CEO and chief financial officer CFO ), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a- 15(e) and 15d- 15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, based on the criteria established under the Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on such evaluation, our management has concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are involved in claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business, some of which involve claims for damages that are substantial in amount. Most of these litigation matters are covered by our insurance policies, which contain deductibles, exclusions, claim limits and aggregate policy limits. Such litigation and other proceedings may include, but are not limited to, actions relating to commercial relationships, standard brokerage disputes like the alleged failure to disclose physical or environmental defects or property expenses or contracts, the alleged inadequate disclosure of matters relating to the transaction like the relationships among the parties to the transaction, potential claims or losses pertaining to the asset, vicarious liability based upon conduct of individuals or entities outside of our control, general fraud claims, conflicts of interest claims, employment law claims, including claims challenging the classification of our sales professionals as independent contractors, claims alleging violations of state consumer fraud statutes and intellectual property. While the ultimate liability for these legal proceedings cannot be determined, we review the need for an accrual for loss contingencies quarterly and record an accrual for litigation related losses where the likelihood of loss is both probable and estimable. We do not believe, based on information currently available to us, that the final outcome of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

-3- EXHIBIT A TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT GRANT 1. Grant. The Company hereby grants to the individual named in the Notice of Grant attached as Part I of this Award Agreement (the Participant under the Plan an Award of Restricted Stock Units, subject to all of the terms and conditions in this Award Agreement and the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference. Subject to Section 13 of the Plan, in the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of the Plan and the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement, the terms and conditions of the Plan will prevail. 2. Company s Obligation to Pay. Each Restricted Stock Unit represents the right to receive a Share on the date it vests. Unless and until the Restricted Stock Units will have vested in the manner set forth in Section 3, Participant will have no right to payment of any such Restricted Stock Units. Prior to actual payment of any vested Restricted Stock Units, such Restricted Stock Unit will represent an unsecured obligation of the Company, payable (if at all) only from the general assets of the Company. Any Restricted Stock Units that vest in accordance with Sections 3 or 4 will be paid to Participant (or in the event of Participant s death, to his or her estate) in whole Shares as set forth herein, subject to Participant satisfying any applicable tax withholding or other obligations as set forth in Section 7. Subject to the provisions of Section 4, such vested Restricted Stock Units will be paid in Shares as soon as practicable after vesting, but in each such case within the period ending no later than the date that is two and one-half (2 months from the end of the Company s tax year that includes the vesting date. 3. Vesting Schedule. Except as provided in Section 4, and subject to Section 5, the Restricted Stock Units awarded by this Award Agreement will vest in accordance with the vesting provisions set forth in the Notice of Grant. Restricted Stock Units scheduled to vest on a certain date or upon the occurrence of a certain condition will not vest in Participant in accordance with any of the provisions of this Award Agreement, unless Participant will have been continuously a Service Provider from the Date of Grant until the date such vesting occurs. Service Provider status will end on the day that notice of termination is provided whether oral or written (whether by the Company or Parent or Subsidiary for any reason or by Participant upon resignation) and will not be extended by any notice period that may be required contractually or under applicable local law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator (or any delegate) shall have the sole and absolute discretion to determine when Participant is no longer providing active service for purposes of Service Provider status and participation in the Plan. 4. Administrator Discretion. The Administrator, in its discretion, may accelerate the vesting of the balance, or some lesser portion of the balance, of the unvested Restricted Stock Units at any time, subject to the terms of the Plan. If so accelerated, such Restricted Stock Units will be considered as having vested as of the date specified by the Administrator. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or this Award Agreement to the contrary, if the vesting of the balance, or some lesser portion of the balance, of the Restricted Stock Units is accelerated in connection with Participant s termination as a Service Provider (provided that such termination is a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A, as 

-4- determined by the Company), other than due to death, and if (x) Participant is a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A at the time of such termination as a Service Provider and (y) the payment of such accelerated Restricted Stock Units will result in the imposition of additional tax under Section 409A if paid to Participant on or within the six (6) month period following Participant s termination as a Service Provider, then the payment of such accelerated Restricted Stock Units will not be made until the date six (6) months and one (1) day following the date of Participant s termination as a Service Provider, unless Participant dies following his or her termination as a Service Provider, in which case, the Restricted Stock Units will be paid in Shares to Participant s estate as soon as practicable following his or her death. It is the intent of this Award Agreement to comply with the requirements of Section 409A so that none of the Restricted Stock Units provided under this Award Agreement or Shares issuable thereunder will be subject to the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, and any ambiguities herein will be interpreted to so comply. For purposes of this Award Agreement, Section 409A means Section 409A of the Code, and any proposed, temporary or final Treasury Regulations and Internal Revenue Service guidance thereunder, as each may be amended from time to time. 5. Forfeiture upon Termination of Status as a Service Provider. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Award Agreement, the balance of the Restricted Stock Units that have not vested as of the time oral or written notice is provided (whether by Participant or the Company or Parent or Subsidiary) of Participant s termination as a Service Provider for any or no reason and Participant s right to acquire any Shares hereunder will immediately terminate. 6. Death of Participant. Any distribution or delivery to be made to Participant under this Award Agreement will, if Participant is then deceased, be made to Participant s designated beneficiary, or if no beneficiary survives Participant, the administrator or executor of Participant s estate. Any such transferee must furnish the Company with (a) written notice of his or her status as transferee, and (b) evidence satisfactory to the Company to establish the validity of the transfer and compliance with any laws or regulations pertaining to said transfer. 7. Withholding of Taxes. Regardless of any action the Company or Participant s employer (the Employer takes with respect to any or all applicable national, local, or other tax or social contribution, withholding, required deductions, or other payments, if any, that arise upon the grant or vesting of the Restricted Stock Units or the holding or subsequent sale of Shares, and the receipt of dividends or other distributions, if any Tax-Related Items ), Participant acknowledges and agrees that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by Participant is and remains Participant s responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. Participant further acknowledges that the Company and the Employer (a) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units, including grant or vesting, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired under the Plan, and the receipt of dividends or other distributions, if any; and (b) does not commit to and is under no obligation to structure the terms of the Restricted Stock Units or any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units to reduce or eliminate Participant s liability for Tax-Related Items, or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if Participant has become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction between the date of grant and the date of any relevant taxable event, Participant acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold 

-5- or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Award Agreement, no certificate representing the Shares will be issued to Participant, unless and until satisfactory arrangements (as determined by the Administrator) will have been made by Participant with respect to the payment of any Tax-Related Items which the Company determines must be withheld with respect to such Shares. The Administrator, in its sole discretion and pursuant to such procedures as it may specify from time to time, may permit Participant to satisfy such Tax-Related Items, in whole or in part (without limitation) by (a) paying cash, (b) electing to have the Company withhold otherwise deliverable Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the minimum amount required to be withheld, (c) delivering to the Company already vested and owned Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be withheld, or (d) selling a sufficient number of such Shares otherwise deliverable to Participant through such means as the Company may determine in its sole discretion (whether through a broker or otherwise) equal to the amount required to be withheld. To the extent determined appropriate by the Company in its discretion, it will have the right (but not the obligation) to satisfy any Tax-Related Items by reducing the number of Shares otherwise deliverable to Participant. If Participant fails to make satisfactory arrangements for the payment of any required Tax-Related Items hereunder at the time any applicable Restricted Stock Units otherwise are scheduled to vest pursuant to Sections 3 or 4, Participant will permanently forfeit such Restricted Stock Units and any right to receive Shares thereunder and the Restricted Stock Units will be returned to the Company at no cost to the Company. 8. Rights as Stockholder. Neither Participant nor any person claiming under or through Participant will have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company in respect of any Shares deliverable hereunder unless and until certificates representing such Shares will have been issued, recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to Participant. After such issuance, recordation and delivery, Participant will have all the rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to voting such Shares and receipt of dividends and distributions on such Shares, but prior to such issuance, Participant will not have any rights to dividends and/or distributions on such Shares. 9. Dividend Equivalents. If a cash dividend is declared on the Shares, Participant shall be credited with a dividend equivalent in an amount of cash equal to the product of (x) the number of Restricted Stock Units held by Participant as of the dividend record date and (y) the amount of the cash dividend paid per Share. Such dividend equivalent shall be paid if and when the underlying Restricted Stock Units vest and are settled. If a Share dividend is declared on the Shares, Participant shall be credited with a dividend equivalent in an amount of Shares equal to the product of (x) the number of Restricted Stock Units held by Participant as of the dividend record date and (y) the amount of the Share dividend distributed per Share. Such dividend equivalents shall be settled if and when the underlying Restricted Stock Units vest and are settled, rounded down to the nearest whole share. Dividend equivalents shall not accrue interest prior to the date of payment or settlement, as applicable. For purposes of clarity, no dividend equivalents shall be credited with respect to any Restricted Stock Units that are settled or terminated prior to the applicable dividend record date. 10. No Guarantee of Continued Service or Grants. PARTICIPANT 

-6- ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE VESTING OF THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS PURSUANT TO THE VESTING SCHEDULE HEREOF IS EARNED ONLY BY CONTINUING AS A SERVICE PROVIDER AT THE WILL OF THE COMPANY (OR THE PARENT OR SUBSIDIARY EMPLOYING OR RETAINING PARTICIPANT) AND NOT THROUGH THE ACT OF BEING HIRED, BEING GRANTED THIS AWARD OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS OR ACQUIRING SHARES HEREUNDER. PARTICIPANT FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS AWARD AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREUNDER AND THE VESTING SCHEDULE SET FORTH HEREIN DO NOT CONSTITUTE AN EXPRESS OR IMPLIED PROMISE OF CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT AS A SERVICE PROVIDER FOR THE VESTING PERIOD, FOR ANY PERIOD, OR AT ALL, AND WILL NOT INTERFERE IN ANY WAY WITH PARTICIPANT S RIGHT OR THE RIGHT OF THE COMPANY (OR THE PARENT OR SUBSIDIARY EMPLOYING OR RETAINING PARTICIPANT) TO TERMINATE PARTICIPANT S RELATIONSHIP AS A SERVICE PROVIDER AT ANY TIME, WITH OR WITHOUT CAUSE. Participant also acknowledges and agrees that: (a) the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and it may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time; (b) the grant of Restricted Stock Units is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of Restricted Stock Units, or benefits in lieu of Restricted Stock Units even if Restricted Stock Units have been granted repeatedly in the past; (c) all decisions with respect to future awards of Restricted Stock Units, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company; (d) Participant s participation in the Plan is voluntary; (e) the Restricted Stock Units and the Shares subject to the Restricted Stock Units are extraordinary items that do not constitute regular compensation for services rendered to the Company or the Employer, and that are outside the scope of Participant s employment contract, if any; (f) the Restricted Stock Units and the Shares subject to the Restricted Stock Units are not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation; (g) the Restricted Stock Units and the Shares subject to the Restricted Stock Units are not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purposes, including, but not limited to, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, dismissal, or end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement or welfare benefits or similar payments and in no event should be considered as compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for the Company or the Employer. 11. Address for Notices. Any notice to be given to the Company under the terms of this Award Agreement will be addressed to the Company, in care of its General Counsel at Marcus and Millichap, Inc., 23975 Park Sorrento, Suite 400, Calabasas, CA 91302, or at such other address as the Company may hereafter designate in writing. 12. Grant is Not Transferable. Except to the limited extent provided in Section 6, this grant and the rights and privileges conferred hereby will not be transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated in any way (whether by operation of law or otherwise) and will not be subject to sale under execution, attachment or similar process. Upon any attempt to transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of this grant, or any right or privilege conferred hereby, or upon any attempted sale under any execution, attachment or similar process, this grant and the rights and privileges conferred hereby immediately will become null and void. 

-7- 13. Binding Agreement. Subject to the limitation on the transferability of this grant contained herein, this Award Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the heirs, legatees, legal representatives, successors and assigns of the parties hereto. 14. Additional Conditions to Issuance of Stock. If at any time the Company will determine, in its discretion, that the listing, registration or qualification of the Shares upon any securities exchange or under any state or federal law, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory authority is necessary or desirable as a condition to the issuance of Shares to Participant (or his or her estate), such issuance will not occur unless and until such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval will have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the Company. Where the Company determines that the delivery of the payment of any Shares will violate federal securities laws or other applicable laws, the Company will defer delivery until the earliest date at which the Company reasonably anticipates that the delivery of Shares will no longer cause such violation. The Company will make all reasonable efforts to meet the requirements of any such state or federal law or securities exchange and to obtain any such consent or approval of any such governmental authority. The Company shall not be obligated to issue any Shares pursuant to the Restricted Stock Units at any time if the issuance of Shares violates or is not in compliance with any laws, rules or regulations of the United States or any state or country. Furthermore, the Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on Participant s participation in the Plan, on the Restricted Stock Units and on any Shares acquired under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable in order to comply with local law or facilitate the administration of the Plan, and to require Participant to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing. Furthermore, Participant understands that the laws of the country in which he or she is resident at the time of grant or vesting of the Restricted Stock Units or the holding or disposition of Shares (including any rules or regulations governing securities, foreign exchange, tax, labor or other matters) may restrict or prevent the issuance of Shares or may subject Participant to additional procedural or regulatory requirements he or she is solely responsible for and will have to independently fulfill in relation to the Restricted Stock Units or the Shares. Notwithstanding any provision herein, the Restricted Stock Units and any Shares shall be subject to any special terms and conditions or disclosures as set forth in any addendum for Participant s country (the Country-Specific Addendum, which forms part this Award Agreement). 15. Plan Governs. This Award Agreement is subject to all terms and provisions of the Plan. In the event of a conflict between one or more provisions of this Award Agreement and one or more provisions of the Plan, the provisions of the Plan will govern. Capitalized terms used and not defined in this Award Agreement will have the meaning set forth in the Plan. 16. Administrator Authority. The Administrator will have the power to interpret the Plan and this Award Agreement and to adopt such rules for the administration, interpretation and application of the Plan as are consistent therewith and to interpret or revoke any such rules (including, but not limited to, the determination of whether or not any Restricted Stock Units have vested). All actions taken and all interpretations and determinations made by the Administrator in good faith will be final and binding upon Participant, the Company and all other 

-8- interested persons. No member of the Administrator will be personally liable for any action, determination or interpretation made in good faith with respect to the Plan or this Award Agreement. 17. Electronic Delivery and Language. The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to Restricted Stock Units awarded under the Plan or future Restricted Stock Units that may be awarded under the Plan by electronic means or request Participant s consent to participate in the Plan by electronic means. Participant hereby consents to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agrees to participate in the Plan through any on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or another third party designated by the Company. If Participant has received this Award Agreement, including appendices, or any other document related to the Plan translated into a language other than English, and the meaning of the translated version is different than the English version, the English version will control. 18. Captions. Captions provided herein are for convenience only and are not to serve as a basis for interpretation or construction of this Award Agreement. 19. Agreement Severable. In the event that any provision in this Award Agreement will be held invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be severable from, and such invalidity or unenforceability will not be construed to have any effect on, the remaining provisions of this Award Agreement. 20. Modifications to the Agreement. This Award Agreement constitutes the entire understanding of the parties on the subjects covered. Participant expressly warrants that he or she is not accepting this Award Agreement in reliance on any promises, representations, or inducements other than those contained herein. Modifications to this Award Agreement or the Plan can be made only in an express written contract executed by a duly authorized officer of the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan or this Award Agreement, the Company reserves the right to revise this Award Agreement as it deems necessary or advisable, in its sole discretion and without the consent of Participant, to comply with Section 409A or to otherwise avoid imposition of any additional tax or income recognition under Section 409A in connection to this Award of Restricted Stock Units. 21. Data Privacy. Participant hereby explicitly and unambiguously consents to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of Participant s personal data as described in this Award Agreement by and among, as applicable, the Company and its affiliates for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing Participant s participation in the Plan. Participant understands that the Company and its affiliates may hold certain personal information about Participant, including, but not limited to, Participant s name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Company or any affiliate, details of all Restricted Stock Units or any other entitlement to shares of stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in Participant s favor, for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan Personal Data ). Participant understands that Personal Data may be transferred to any third parties assisting in the implementation, administration and 

-9- management of the Plan, that these recipients may be located in the United States, Participant s country (if different than the United States), or elsewhere, and that the recipient s country may have different data privacy laws and protections than Participant s country. For Participants located in the European Union, the following paragraph applies: Participant understands that he or she may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Personal Data by contacting Participant s local human resources representative. Participant authorizes the recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Personal Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of implementing, administering and managing Participant s participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Personal Data as may be required to a broker or other third party with whom Participant may elect to deposit any Shares received. Participant understands that Personal Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage Participant s participation in the Plan. Participant understands that he or she may, at any time, view Personal Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Personal Data, require any necessary amendments to Personal Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, without cost, by contacting in writing Participant s local human resources representative. Participant understands that refusal or withdrawal of consent may affect Participant s ability to participate in the Plan or to realize benefits from the Plan. For more information on the consequences of Participant s refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, Participant understands that he or she may contact his or her local human resources representative. 22. Foreign Exchange Fluctuations and Restrictions. Participant understands and agrees that the future value of the underlying Shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty and may decrease. Participant also understands that neither the Company, nor any affiliate is responsible for any foreign exchange fluctuation between local currency and the United States Dollar or the selection by the Company or any affiliate in its sole discretion of an applicable foreign currency exchange rate that may affect the value of the Restricted Stock Units or Shares received (or the calculation of income or Tax-Related Items thereunder). Participant understands and agrees that any cross-border remittance made to transfer proceeds received upon the sale of Shares must be made through a locally authorized financial institution or registered foreign exchange agency and may require Participant to provide such entity with certain information regarding the transaction. 23. Amendment, Suspension or Termination of the Plan. By accepting this Award, Participant expressly warrants that he or she has received an Award of Restricted Stock Units under the Plan, and has received, read and understood a description of the Plan.
