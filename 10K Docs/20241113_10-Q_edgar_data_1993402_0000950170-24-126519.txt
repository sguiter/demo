Incentive fee each described below. Investment income incentive fee The investment income based incentive fee is based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns meaning dividends, cash interest or other distributions or other cash income and any third-party fees received from portfolio companies (such as upfront fees, commitment fees, origination fees, amendment fees, ticking fees and break-up fees, as well as prepayments premiums, but excluding fees for providing managerial assistance and fees earned by the Adviser or an affiliate in its capacity as an administrative agent, syndication agent, collateral agent, loan servicer or other similar capacity) accrued during the month, minus operating expenses for the month (including the Management Fee, taxes, any expenses payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement and Administration Agreement (as defined below), any expense of securitizations, and interest expense or other financing fees and any dividends paid on preferred shares, but excluding the Incentive Fee and shareholder servicing and /or distribution fees). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero-coupon securities), accrued income that has not yet been received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns do not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. The impact of expense support payments and recoupments are also excluded from Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns.

 of cumulative realized capital gains from inception through the end of such calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fee as calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. U.S. GAAP requires that the capital gains incentive fee accrual consider the cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation in the calculation, as a capital gains incentive fee would be payable if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the investment advisory agreement. Such accrual is calculated using the aggregate cumulative realized capital gains and losses and aggregate cumulative unrealized capital depreciation included in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee plus the aggregate cumulative unrealized capital appreciation, net of any expense associated with cumulative unrealized capital depreciation or appreciation. If such amount is positive at the end of a period, then U.S. GAAP requires the Company to record a capital gains incentive fee equal to of such cumulative amount, less the aggregate amount of actual capital gains incentive fees paid or capital gains incentive fees accrued under U.S. GAAP in all prior periods. For purposes of computing the Company s investment income incentive fee and capital gains incentive fee, the calculation methodology looks through derivative financial instruments or swaps as if the Company owned the reference assets directly. The fees that are payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement for any partial period are appropriately prorated. The Adviser has agreed to waive its management fee and incentive fee for the first six months following the date on which unaffiliated investors first purchase the Common Shares. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company incurred income based incentive fees of and , and capital gains incentive fees of and , respectively. Gross capital gains incentive fee is net of reversal on accrued capital gains incentive fees.

Other than with respect to this limited license, the Company will have no legal right to the Antares name. Administration Agreement On December 18, 2023, the Board approved the administration agreement (the Administration Agreement with Antares Capital Credit Advisers LLC (in such role, the Administrator ).

The significant unobservable input used in the yield analysis is the discount rate based on comparable market yields. The significant unobservable inputs used in the income approach are the discount rate used to discount the estimated future cash flows expected to be received from the underlying investment. Significant increases in discount rates would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement. The significant unobservable inputs used in the market approach are based on market comparable transactions and market multiples of publicly traded comparable companies. Increases or decreases in market comparable transactions or market multiples would result in an increase or decrease in the fair value. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company s investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of the Company s investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that the Company may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If the Company was required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, it could realize significantly less than the value at which the Company has recorded it. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected in the valuations currently assigned. As of September 30, 2024 , the carrying amounts of the Company s assets and liabilities, other than investments at fair value, approximate fair value due to their short maturities. Fair value is estimated by discounting remaining payments using applicable current market rates, which take into account changes in the Company s marketplace credit ratings, if applicable, or market quotes, if available.

The initial maximum principal amount under the SG Facility is million and the SG Facility includes an accordion provision to permit increases to the total facility amount up to a maximum of billion, subject in each case to the satisfaction of certain conditions, and, for any increases above million, consent of the Agent and the lenders. Proceeds from loans made under the SG Facility may be used for A-Star SPV's general corporate purposes, to fund collateral obligations acquired by A-Star SPV, to pay certain fees and expenses and to make distributions to the Company, subject to certain conditions set forth in the SG Facility. Revolving loans borrowed under the SG Facility may be repaid and reborrowed until the end of the Revolving Period, which can occur no later than January 19, 2027 (unless extended), and all amounts outstanding under the SG Facility must be repaid by January 19, 2029.

The availability period under the Facility will terminate on July 31, 2028 (the Commitment Termination Date and the Facility will mature on July 31, 2029 (the Maturity Date ).

The Company s Board of Trustees may amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program if it deems such action to be in the best interest of the Company and the best interest of the Company s shareholders. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each semi-annual period.

Distribution Reinvestment Plan The Company has adopted a distribution reinvestment plan, pursuant to which the Company reinvests all cash distributions declared on behalf of the Company's shareholders who do not elect to receive their distributions in cash. As a result, if the Board authorizes and declares a cash distribution, then the shareholders who have enrolled in the distribution reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, rather than receiving the cash distribution. The Company expects to use newly issued shares to implement the distribution reinvestment plan. Distributions on fractional shares are credited to each participating shareholder s account to three decimal places.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 (in thousands, except share/per share data, percentages and as otherwise noted) 
 Overview 
 We are a Delaware statutory trust formed on August 31, 2023 and a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We also intend to elect to be treated, and intend to comply with the requirements to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. We are a private, perpetual-life BDC, which is a BDC whose common shares are not listed for trading on a stock exchange or other securities market. The Company uses the term perpetual-life BDC to describe an investment vehicle of indefinite duration whose common shares are intended to be sold by the Company quarterly on a continuous basis at a price generally equal to the Company's NAV per Common Share. 
 Our investment objective is to provide risk-adjusted returns and current income to shareholders by investing primarily in loans to U.S. borrowers. 
 Our investment strategy focuses primarily on Portfolio Loans to U.S. borrowers. A Portfolio Loan is a senior secured loan, which may be first lien, second lien or unitranche loan, consisting of term loans and/or related delayed draw term loans and/or revolving loans, and each tranche of a senior secured loan acquired by the Company is referred to as a Portfolio Loan. The Company is expected to acquire Portfolio Loans that have been sourced and underwritten by Antares Parties or by other loan originators that can include, among others, joint ventures in which one or more Antares Parties have interests. Unitranche loans represent a hybrid loan structure that combines senior debt and subordinated debt into one loan. 
 While our investment strategy primarily focuses on companies in the U.S., we also intend to leverage Antares global presence to invest in companies in Canada, Europe and other locations outside the U.S., subject to compliance with BDC requirements to invest at least 70 of assets in eligible portfolio companies. We may also invest in preferred equity, or our debt investments may be accompanied by equity-related securities (such as options or warrants) and/or select common equity investments. 
 Our investment strategy also includes a smaller allocation to more liquid credit investments such as broadly syndicated loans and corporate bonds. We may use these investments to maintain liquidity for our share repurchase program and manage cash before investing subscription proceeds into originated loans, while also seeking attractive investment returns. We may also invest in publicly traded securities of larger corporate issuers on an opportunistic basis when market conditions create compelling potential return opportunities, subject to compliance with BDC requirements to invest at least 70 of assets in eligible portfolio companies. 
 To seek to enhance our returns, we intend to employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of the Adviser, but in no event will leverage employed exceed the limitations set forth in the 1940 Act, which currently allows us to borrow up to a 2:1 debt to equity ratio. We intend to use leverage in the form of borrowings, including loans from certain financial institutions and the issuance of debt securities. We may also use leverage in the form of the issuance of preferred shares, but do not currently intend to do so. In determining whether to borrow money, we will analyze the maturity, covenant package and rate structure of the proposed borrowings as well as the risks of such borrowings compared to our investment outlook. Any such leverage, if incurred, would be expected to increase the total capital available for investment by the Company. 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenue in the form of interest and fee income on debt investments, capital gains, and dividend income from our equity investments in our portfolio companies. Our senior and subordinated debt investments bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. Interest on debt securities is generally payable quarterly or semiannually. In some cases, some of our investments may provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid PIK interest generally become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue from various fees in the ordinary course of business such as in the form of structuring, consent, waiver, amendment, syndication and other miscellaneous fees. Original issue discounts and market discounts or premiums are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income. Dividend income, if any, is recognized on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. 
 Expenses 
 Except as specifically provided below, all investment professionals and staff of Antares Capital Credit Advisers LLC (the Adviser ), when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory services to us, and the base compensation, bonus and benefits, and the routine overhead expenses, of such personnel allocable to such services, will be provided and paid for by the Adviser. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions, including, but not limited to: 
 
 investment advisory fees, including management fees and incentive fees, paid to the Adviser pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement; 

the Company's allocable portion of compensation, overhead (including rent, office equipment and utilities) and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its administrative obligations under the Administration Agreement, including but not limited to: (i) the Company's chief compliance officer, chief financial officer and their respective staffs; (ii) investor relations, legal, operations and other non-investment professionals at the Administrator that perform duties for the Company; and (iii) any internal audit group personnel of the Adviser or any of its affiliates; and

 all other expenses of the Company's operations, administration and transactions (which may be directly incurred by the Company or allocated among the Company and the Adviser s other clients) 

From time to time, the Adviser or its affiliates may pay third-party providers of goods or services. We reimburse the Adviser such affiliates thereof for any such amounts paid on our behalf. From time to time, the Adviser may defer or waive fees and/or rights to be reimbursed for expenses. All of the foregoing expenses are ultimately borne by our shareholders, unless waived. 
 Portfolio and Investment Activity 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had investments in 339 portfolio companies across 40 industries. Based on fair value as of September 30, 2024, approximately 99.92 of our debt portfolio was invested in debt bearing a floating interest rate, which primarily are subject to interest rate floors. As of September 30, 2024, our weighted average total yield of debt securities at amortized cost was 9.62 . Weighted average yields excludes the effect of accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums and are based on interest rates as of September 30, 2024.

(1) Computed based on the stated interest rate or yield as of September 30, 2024, and weighted based on the total debt investments (at fair value or amortized cost, as applicable). Actual yields earned over the life of each investment could differ materially from the yields presented above. Weighted average yield excludes the effect of accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums. 

(2) Includes all private loan investments for which fair value is determined by the Adviser at least quarterly (with assistance, as applicable, from a third-party valuation firm, and subject to oversight by the Board). Figures are derived from the financial statements most recently obtained by the Adviser. 

(3) Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") refers to adjusted EBITDA in accordance with the underlying governing documents. Excludes investments with no reported EBITDA or where EBITDA, in the Adviser s judgment, was not a material component of the investment thesis, such as annual recurring revenue loans, or investments with negative EBITDA. Weighted average EBITDA is weighted based on the funded commitment of total applicable private loans. 

(4) Net senior leverage is the ratio of total debt minus unrestricted cash divided by LTM EBITDA and taking into account leverage through the tranche in which the Company holds an investment, excluding recurring revenue investments. 

(5) LTV is calculated as net debt through each respective investment tranche in which the Company holds an investment divided by estimated enterprise value or value of the underlying collateral of the portfolio company. Weighted average LTV is weighted based on the funded commitment of the total applicable private loans.

Table of Contents 

 As part of the monitoring process, our Adviser has developed risk policies pursuant to which it regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our debt investments. Our Adviser has developed a classification system to group investments into five categories. The investments are evaluated regularly and assigned a category based on certain credit metrics. Our Adviser s ratings do not constitute any rating of investments by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or represent or reflect any third-party assessment of any of our investments. Please see below for a description of the five categories of the Adviser s Internal Risk Rating system: 
 
 Internal Performance Rating A: Portfolio Companies performing generally as expected or above expectations and the trends and risk factors are generally neutral to favorable since origination. No concern about repayment of both interest and principal. All investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially assessed this level. 

Internal Performance Rating B: Portfolio Companies performing generally as expected but the trends require increased monitoring. Portfolio companies are current on both interest and principal payments. 

Internal Performance Rating C: Portfolio Companies performing below expectations and level of risk has increased since the time of origination. Portfolio companies are generally current on both interest and principal payments. 

Internal Performance Rating D: Portfolio Companies performing materially below expectations and the level of risk has increased materially since origination. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with original debt covenants, loan payments may be past due, but generally not by more than 120 days. There is a higher risk of both payment default and repayment of interest and principal in full. 

Internal Performance Rating E: Portfolio Companies are non-earning and performing substantially below expectations. The level of risk has increased substantially since origination. Most or all of the original debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. There is a high risk that all principal and interest will not be recovered in full. 

The following table shows the distribution of our investments on the A to E internal performance rating scale at fair value:

Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations can vary from period to period as a result of various factors, including deployment, the level of new investment commitments, the recognition of realized gains and losses and changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on the investment portfolio. As a result, comparisons may not be meaningful. 
 
 Investment Income

70,792 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in our total investment income was driven by our deployment of capital and increase in invested balance of investments. The size of our investment portfolio at fair value increased from 1,031.9 million as of June 30, 2024, to 1,565.6 million as of September 30, 2024, thus increasing balance of interest-bearing securities held throughout the period. Interest income on our debt investments is dependent on the composition and credit quality of the portfolio. Generally, we expect the portfolio to generate predictable quarterly interest income based on the terms stated in each loan s credit agreement.

We determine the fair value of our investments quarterly and any changes in fair value are recorded as unrealized gains or losses. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, net change in unrealized gains (losses) on our investments were 0.4) million and 0.9 million, respectively. The valuations of our debt investments generally increase or decrease as a result of various factors, including tightening and widening credit spreads of public and private markets, as well as changes in transaction prices during the period. 
 
 Management fee 
 The base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of 1.25 of the average of the Company s net asset value as of the beginning of the prior quarter and the beginning of the then current quarter. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 the Company incurred management fees of 2.4 million and 3.3 million, respectively, and the Adviser elected to waive all management fees resulting in zero management fees for the period. 
 Incentive fee 
 The incentive fee consists of two components that are independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. A portion of the incentive fee is based on a percentage of income and a portion is based on a percentage of capital gains, each described below. 
 Income based incentive fee 
 The income based incentive fee is based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns meaning dividends, cash interest or other distributions or other cash income and any third-party fees received from portfolio companies (such as upfront fees, commitment fees, origination fees, amendment fees, ticking fees and break-up fees, as well as prepayments premiums, but excluding fees for providing managerial assistance and fees earned by the Adviser or an affiliate in its capacity as an administrative agent, syndication agent, collateral agent, loan servicer or other similar capacity) accrued during the month, minus operating expenses for the month (including the Management Fee, taxes, any expenses payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement and Administration Agreement (as defined below), any expense of securitizations, and interest expense or other financing fees and any dividends paid on preferred shares, but excluding the Incentive Fee and shareholder servicing and /or distribution fees). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with payment-in-kind PIK interest and zero-coupon securities), accrued income that has not yet been received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment 
 60 

Table of Contents 

 Income Returns do not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. The impact of expense support payments and recoupments are also excluded from Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns. 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, expressed as a rate of return on the value of net assets at the end of the preceding quarter, is compared to a hurdle rate of return of 1.25 per quarter (5.0 annualized). The Company pays an incentive fee quarterly as follows: 
 Investment Income Incentive Fee based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in any calendar quarter in which the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns does not exceed the hurdle rate of 1.25 per quarter (5.0 annualized). 

100 of the dollar amount of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than a rate of return of 1.43 (5.72 annualized). 

12.5 of the dollar amount of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceed a rate of return of 1.43 (5.72 annualized). 

Capital gains incentive fee 
 The second component of the incentive fee, the capital gains incentive fee, is payable at the end of each calendar year in arrears. The amount payable is equal to 12.5 of cumulative realized capital gains from inception through the end of such calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fee as calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. GAAP requires that the capital gains incentive fee accrual consider the cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation in the calculation, as a capital gains incentive fee would be payable if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the investment advisory agreement. This GAAP accrual is calculated using the aggregate cumulative realized capital gains and losses and aggregate cumulative unrealized capital depreciation included in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee plus the aggregate cumulative unrealized capital appreciation, net of any expense associated with cumulative unrealized capital depreciation or appreciation. If such amount is positive at the end of a period, then GAAP requires the Company to record a capital gains incentive fee equal to 12.5 of such cumulative amount, less the aggregate amount of actual capital gains incentive fees paid or capital gains incentive fees accrued under GAAP in all prior periods. 
 For purposes of computing the Company s investment income incentive fee and capital gains incentive fee, the calculation methodology looks through derivative financial instruments or swaps as if the Company owned the reference assets directly. The fees that are payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement for any partial period are appropriately prorated. 
 The Adviser has agreed to waive its management fee and incentive fee for the first six months following the date on which unaffiliated investors first purchase the Common Shares. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred income based incentive fees of 3,864 and 7,112, and capital gains incentive fees of (174) and 0, respectively. Gross capital gains incentive fee is net of reversal on accrued capital gains incentive fees. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Adviser agreed to waive 3,690 and 7,112 in total incentive fees, respectively, resulting in zero incentive fees payable. 
 Expense Support Agreement 
 On December 18, 2023, the Board approved an expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement (the Expense Support Agreement ). Under the terms of the Expense Support Agreement, the Adviser is obligated to pay the Company s total organization and offering expenses, professional fees, trustee fees, administration fees, and other general and administrative expenses of the Company on the Company s behalf such that these operating expenses of the Company do not exceed 1.00 (on annualized basis) of the Company s net asset value. Additionally, the Adviser may elect to pay certain additional expenses of the Company on the Company s behalf. To the extent the Company s net asset value increases, the Adviser or its affiliates may be reimbursed for past payments of excess organization and offering costs made on the Company s behalf provided that the total organization and offering costs borne by the Company do not exceed 1.00 of the Company s net asset value and provided further that the Adviser or its affiliates may not be reimbursed for payment of excess organization and offering expenses that were incurred more than three years prior to the proposed reimbursement. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Adviser has not provided any expense support pursuant to the Expense Support Agreement which is included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company s obligation to make a reimbursement payment shall automatically become a liability of the Company on the last business day of the applicable calendar month, except to the extent the Adviser has waived its right to receive such payment for the applicable month. 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We expect to generate cash primarily from (i) the net proceeds of the Private Offering, (ii) cash flows from our operations, (iii) any financing arrangements we may enter into in the future and (iv) any future offerings of our equity or debt securities. Our primary uses of cash will be for (i) investments in Portfolio Companies and other investments, (ii) the cost of operations (including paying Antares Capital Credit (in its capacity as the Adviser and/or the Administrator)), (iii) cost of any borrowings or other financing arrangements and (iv) cash distributions to the holders of our shares. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 we had two credit facilities outstanding. From time to time, we may enter into additional credit facilities, increase the size of our existing credit facilities, enter additional short-term lending arrangements, and/or issue debt securities, including additional unsecured notes. In

 accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred stock, if immediately after the borrowing or issuance, the ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness plus preferred stock, is at least 150 . As of September 30, 2024 we had an aggregate amount of 482.0 million of debt outstanding and our asset coverage ratio was 314.22 . We seek to carefully consider our unfunded commitments for the purpose of planning our ongoing financial leverage.

Share Repurchase Program 
 We will commence a share repurchase program, one year following the date on which unaffiliated investors first purchase the Common Shares, in which we intend to repurchase, semi-annually, up to 7.5 of the Common Shares outstanding (either by number of Common Shares or aggregate net asset value) as of the close of the previous semi-annual period. Our Board of Trustees may amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program if it deems such action to be in the best interest of us and the best interest of our shareholders. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each semi-annual period. We intend to conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the 1940 Act. All shares purchased pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares. 
 Under our share repurchase program, to the extent we offer to repurchase shares in any particular period, we expect to repurchase shares pursuant to tender offers using a purchase price equal to the net asset value per share as of the last calendar day of the applicable semi-annual period. 
 
 Distributions 
 We authorize and declare distribution amounts per share of common shares of beneficial interest payable quarterly in arrears. The record date for each distribution was the last calendar date of each quarter.

Distribution Reinvestment Plan 
 We have adopted a distribution reinvestment plan, pursuant to which we will reinvest all cash distributions declared on behalf of our shareholders who do not elect to receive their distributions in cash as provided below. As a result, if we declare a cash distribution, then shareholders who have not opted out of our distribution reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares as described below, rather than receiving the cash distribution. Distributions on fractional shares will be credited to each participating shareholder s account to three decimal places.

 Related-Party Transactions 
 We expect to enter into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the Investment Advisory Agreement and expense support agreement. 
 In addition to the aforementioned agreements, we, our Adviser and certain of our Adviser s affiliates have been granted exemptive relief by the SEC to co-invest with other funds managed by our Adviser or its affiliates in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. 
 Recent Developments 
 Equity Issuances 
 
 On October 1, 2024, the Company sold and issued 7,750,876 Common Shares for an aggregate consideration of approximately 197.5 million at a price of 25.48 per Common Share. 
 
 Waiver Letter Agreement 
 
 Effective as of October 29, 2024, the Company and the Adviser entered into a waiver letter agreement (the Waiver Letter Agreement ), pursuant to which the Adviser agreed to waive (i) fifty percent (50 of any base management fee due from the Company to the Adviser under Section 5(a) of the Investment Advisory Agreement and (ii) fifty percent (50 of any incentive fee due from the Company to the Adviser under Section 5(b) of the Investment Advisory Agreement, for the period from October 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of the consolidated financial statements will require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. In addition, our critical accounting estimates related to investments, fair value measurement, interest and dividends income recognition and income taxes are included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 The Company is required to report its investments for which current market values are not readily available at fair value. The Company values its investments in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, which defines fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the applicable measurement date. ASC 820 prioritizes the use of observable market prices derived from such prices over entity-specific inputs. Due to the inherent uncertainties of valuation, certain estimated fair values may differ significantly from the values that would have been realized had a ready market for these investments existed, and these differences could be material. 
 We entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with the Adviser to provide us with investment advisory services and the Administration Agreement with Antares Capital Credit (in its capacity as the Administrator) to provide us with administrative services. Payments for investment advisory services under the Investment Advisory Agreements and reimbursements under the Administration Agreement are described in Item 1. Business. 
 We have established one or more credit facilities and may in the future establish additional credit facilities or enter into other financing arrangements to facilitate investments and the timely payment of our expenses. It is anticipated that any such credit facilities will bear interest at floating rates at to-be-determined spreads over Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR (or other applicable reference rate). We cannot assure shareholders that we will be able to enter into a credit facility on favorable terms or at all. In connection with a credit facility or other borrowings, lenders may require us to pledge assets, commitments and/or drawdowns (and the ability to enforce the payment thereof and may ask to comply with positive or negative covenants that could have an effect on our operations.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Other than contractual commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of our business, we do not expect to have any off-balance sheet financings or liabilities. 
 Unfunded Commitments 
 The Company s investment portfolio may contain revolving line of credit or delayed draw commitments, which require the Company to fund when requested by portfolio companies. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had unfunded investment commitment in the aggregate par amount of 547.0 million. Such commitments are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the documents governing these loans and letters of credit and there can be no assurance that such conditions will be satisfied.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 We will be subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. A rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher interest rates applicable to the variable rate investments we may hold and to declines in the value of any fixed rate investments we may hold. A rise in interest rates would also be expected to lead to higher cost on our floating rate borrowings. If deemed prudent, we may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to minimize our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. 
 Valuation Risk 
 We plan to invest primarily in illiquid debt securities of private companies. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market price, and we will value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to procedures adopted by, and under the oversight of, the Board in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. We intend to fund portions of our investments with borrowings, and at such time, our net investment income will be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. Accordingly, we cannot assure shareholders that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 99.92 of our performing debt investments at fair value were at floating rates, which are generally SOFR based and typically have durations of one to three months after which they reset to current interest rates, and many of which are subject to certain floors. Our credit facilities (including the SG Facility and Revolving Credit Facility) bear interest at floating rates with no interest rate floor. Based on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2024, the following table shows the annualized impact on net income of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates (considering base rate floors and ceilings for floating rate instruments) and assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure:

We may in the future hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using hedging instruments such as additional interest rate swaps, futures, options and forward contracts. While hedging activities may mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates, certain hedging transactions that we may enter into in the future, such as interest rate swap agreements, may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of changes in interest rates with respect to our portfolio investments.
