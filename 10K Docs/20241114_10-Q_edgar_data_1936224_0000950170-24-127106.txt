 reverse stock split for all shares of the Company s common stock issued and outstanding . As a result of the reverse stock split, every seven shares of the Company s old common stock were converted into one share of the Company s new common stock. Fractional shares resulting from the reverse stock split were settled by cash payment. Options, and other like awards, to purchase the Company s common stock were also adjusted in accordance with their terms to reflect the reverse stock split. Adjustments resulting from the reverse stock split have been retroactively reflected as of all periods presented herein. Southern Acquisition On (the Acquisition Date ), immediately prior to the Company s listing on the NYSE and after the consummation of the Internal Reorganization, the Company effected the acquisition of all equity interests of Southern Airways Corporation Southern ), whereby a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company merged with and into Southern, after which Southern became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the Southern Acquisition ). Pursuant to the Southern Acquisition, Southern stockholders were to receive shares of the Company s common stock, which was based on the aggregate merger consideration of million at the per share opening price on the first day of listing of the Company s common stock. In total, shares of Company common stock were issued to former Southern shareholders while the remaining amount was paid out in cash in lieu of fractional shares to those shareholders on a pro rata basis.

aircraft, including the Cessna Caravan, the Cessna Grand Caravan, the Saab 340, the Pilatus PC-12, and the Tecnam Traveller. Southern provides both seasonal and full-year scheduled passenger air transportation service in the Mid-Atlantic and Gulf regions, Rockies and West Coast, and Hawaii, with select routes subsidized by the United States Department of Transportation U.S. DOT under the Essential Air Service EAS program. Following the Southern Acquisition, the Company operates a combined regional airline network servicing U.S. cities across the Mid-Atlantic, Gulf South, Midwest, Rocky Mountains, West Coast, New England and Hawaii. Liquidity and Going Concern The Company has incurred losses from operations, negative cash flows from operating activities and has a working capital deficit. In addition, the Company is currently in default of certain excise and property taxes as well as certain debt obligations. These tax and debt obligations are classified as current liabilities on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As discussed in Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies , on May 15, 2018, the Company received a notice of a tax lien filing from the Internal Revenue Service IRS for unpaid federal excise taxes for the quarterly periods beginning October 2016 through September 2017 in the amount of million, including penalties and interest as of the date of the notice. The Company agreed to a payment plan (the Installment Plan whereby the IRS would take no further action and remove such liens at the time such amounts have been paid. In 2019, the Company defaulted on the Installment Plan. Defaulting on the Installment Plan can result in the IRS nullifying such plan, placing the Company in default and taking collection action against the Company for any unpaid balance. The Company s total outstanding federal excise tax liability including accrued penalties and interest of million is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024 . In June 2024, the Company submitted a formal offer-in-compromise OIC to the IRS, seeking to resolve all excise tax liabilities. Under the terms of the OIC, all collection actions against the Company, in relation to these matters, will be abated and the Company has made monthly payments of thousand on historical excise tax liabilities while the IRS is considering the OIC. The Company has also defaulted on its property tax obligations in various California counties in relation to fixed assets, plane usage and aircraft leases. The Company s total outstanding property tax liability including penalties and interest is approximately million as of September 30, 2024. Additionally, Los Angeles County has imposed a tax lien on four of the Company s leased aircraft due to the late filing of the Company s 2022 property tax return. As of September 30, 2024, the amount of property tax, interest and penalties accrued related to the Los Angeles County tax lien for all unpaid tax years was approximatel y million. The Company is in the process of remediating the late filing and payment of the property taxes due to Los Angeles County. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company was also in default of the Simple Agreements for Future Equity with Token allocation SAFE-T note, where the note matured in July 2019. The SAFE-T note is subordinate to the Company s Convertible Note Purchase Agreement (as defined below); therefore, the Company cannot pay the outstanding balance prior to paying amounts due under the Convertible Note Purchase Agreement with PFG. The SAFE-T note had an outstanding principal amount of million as of September 30, 2024. Additionally, the Company was in arrears of thousand in contractual interest payments due under the Convertible Note Purchase Agreement. This has resulted in PFG applying a default rate of interest of on outstanding amounts. (see Note 8, Financing Arrangements ). In connection with past due rental and maintenance payments under certain aircraft leases totaling in aggregate approximately million, which is accrued for at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company entered into a payment plan pursuant to which all payments of the past due amounts are deferred until such time as the Company receives at least million in aggregate funds in connection with any capital contribution, at which time it is required to repay million of such past due payments, with the eventual full repayment of the remaining amounts being required upon the receipt of at least million in capital contributions. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company has classified million as a current liability as potentially triggered by capital contributions received as follows: the funds received by the Company in July 2023 of million under a convertible note purchase agreement with Partners for Growth V, L.P. PFG ), million through the share purchase agreement SPA with GEM Global Yield LLC SCS GEM ), and an entity affiliated with GEM that provides incremental financing (the GEM Purchase ), and million in cumulative funding through advances and share draws under the Share Purchase Agreement with GEM. As of September 30, 2024 the Company has t made any payments under this payment plan. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The going concern assumption contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.

million under a convertible note purchase agreement with PFG, million through the GEM Purchase Agreement and million in advances and draws under the second amended and restated Share Purchase Agreement with GEM (see Note 9, Share Purchase Agreement, GEM Purchase, and Mandatory Convertible Security ). During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received an additional million in advances under the second amended and restated Share Purchase Agreement with GEM. The Company had previously filed a Form S-1 registration statement (File No. 333-274573) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), registering up to million shares of the Company s common stock, which represents shares of the Company s common stock issued to GEM under the GEM Purchase Agreement, shares of the Company s common stock issued to GEM in connection with the initial issuance to GEM under the Share Purchase Agreement, shares of the Company s common stock issued to GEM in satisfaction of the commitment fee under the Share Purchase Agreement, and up to shares of the Company s common stock to be issued to GEM in connection with the Share Purchase Agreement. Additionally, the Company had previously filed a Form S-1 registration statement (File No. 333-275434) with the SEC, registering up to million shares of the Company s common stock, which represents the balance of the full amount of shares of common stock that the Company estimated could be issued and sold to GEM for advances under the Share Purchase Agreement, plus the amount of shares the Company estimated could be sold to GEM for million under the Share Purchase Agreement, (collectively, the Prior Registration Statements ). In connection with the GEM Mandatory Convertible Security (see Note 9, Share Purchase Agreement, GEM Purchase, and Mandatory Convertible Security ), the Company deregistered all of the shares registered but unsold under the Prior Registration Statements on June 4, 2024. The combined shares contemplated under the Prior Registration Statements have been included in a Form S-1 Registration Statement (File No. 333-279929), which was declared effective by the SEC on August 7, 2024. As of September 30, 2024 , the contractual terms allow the Company to make further advances of up to million under the Share Purchase Agreement. Additionally, the Company has the ability to draw an additional million under the Share Purchase Agreement, subject to daily volume limitations and GEM s requirement to hold less than of the fully-diluted shares of the Company. As of September 30, 2024 , GEM held of the then fully-diluted shares of the Company. At September 30, 2024 , the daily volume limitations under the Share Purchase Agreement restricted our ability to take additional draws under the Share Purchase Agreement to approximately thousand shares per draw. Additionally, the Company s ability to draw upon the Share Purchase Agreement is contingent on the Company s common stock being listed on a national exchange. The Company is currently attempting to resolve one listing requirement violations with the New York Stock Exchange. While not currently subject to de-listing, the Company s inability to cure this listing requirement violation would impact its ability to raise capital through the Share Purchase Agreement. The Company is currently implementing operational improvements and stringent operating expenses management to improve the profitability of its airline operations. In parallel, the Company is advancing its technology initiatives, including its software technology platform and Caravan electrification programs. In addition, the Company continues to evaluate strategies to obtain additional funding for future operations. These strategies may include, but are not limited to, obtaining additional equity financing, issuing additional debt or entering into other financing arrangements, forming joint venture and other partnerships, and restructuring of operations to grow revenues and decrease expenses. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in achieving its strategic plans, that new financing will be available to the Company in a timely manner or on acceptable terms, if at all. If the Company is unable to raise sufficient financing when needed or events or circumstances occur such that the Company does not meet its strategic plans or, the Company will be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily limited to, reducing certain spending, altering or scaling back development plans, including plans to equip regional airline operations with fully-electric or hybrid-electric aircraft, or reducing funding of capital expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and ability to achieve its intended business objectives. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

million. The agreement is secured by a first security interest in all assets of Southern Airways Express, a subsidiary of Southern. The financing arrangement is uncommitted, and upon funding does not qualify for sale accounting as the Company does not relinquish control of the receivables based on, among other things, the nature and extent of the Company s continuing involvement. Accordingly, the accounts receivable remain on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets until paid by the customer and cash proceeds from the financing arrangement are recorded as collateralized borrowing in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, with attributable interest expense recognized over the life of the related transactions. Interest expense and contractual fees associated with the collateralized borrowings are included in interest expense and other expense, net, respectively, in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

, the Company completed the acquisition of all issued and outstanding shares of Southern. The Southern Acquisition expands the Company s regional airline network servicing U.S. cities across the Mid-Atlantic, Gulf South, Midwest, Rocky Mountains, West Coast, New England and Hawaii. Total consideration is comprised of million of equity consideration, through the issuance of shares of the Company s common stock on close of the Southern Acquisition and thousand of payments made by the Company to settle debt obligations of Southern, which were not assumed as part of the acquisition. As the transaction closed prior to the Company s listing on the NYSE on July 27, 2023, the fair value of the common stock issued to Southern stockholders was based on the opening trading price of the Company s common stock on July 27, 2023 of per share. Subsequent to the issuance of shares of the Company s common stock as purchase consideration, the Company repurchased shares from employees for million in satisfaction of employee tax withholdings related to such issuance. The Company allocated the purchase price to million of identified intangible assets and million of net liabilities, with the excess purchase price of million recorded as goodwill. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company recorded an impairment of the goodwill initially recorded due to the identification of impairment indicators, such as additional delays of aircraft maintenance due to the unavailability of parts, which resulted in a higher cancellation rate of scheduled flights. These delays have continued into 2024. Additionally, the Company incurred higher cash requirements than expected to fund the operations of the Southern reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher maintenance costs. Further, unplanned delays in aircraft deliveries under the Textron aircraft supply agreement, including December 2023 cancellations of both firm deliveries and additional purchase options, have delayed re-fleeting efforts. The resulting goodwill impairment charge of million was the result of comparing the fair value of the Southern reporting unit to its carrying value.

Pursuant to the amended and restated SPA, and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, the Company will have the right from time to time at its option to direct GEM to purchase up to the Aggregate Limit of shares of the Company s common stock over the term of the amended and restated SPA. Upon its public listing, the Company may request GEM to provide advances under the SPA in an aggregate amount of up to million, provided that individual advances are not to exceed million each, with the first advance not to exceed million.

Pursuant to GEM s associated registration rights, the Company filed a re-sale registration statement, covering the shares, on August 2, 2023, which was declared effective by the SEC on September 28, 2023. The Company has accounted for the shares issuance contracts under the SPA, as amended, as derivative financial instruments which are recorded at fair value within Other long-term liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, GEM converted thousand of the par amount of the Mandatory Convertible Security, through the issuance of shares of the Company s common stock. A liability of million associated with the Mandatory Convertible Security was recorded as of the Closing Date. The fair value of the liability was estimated using a model based on multiple stock price paths developed through the use of a Monte Carlo simulation that incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the Company will not be able to satisfy the liability through the issuance of shares of common stock and taking into account the value of the consideration transferred to the Company upon closing of the MCSPA . This was inclusive of the value of the shares returned to the Company and the cancellation of the share transfers due in settlement of the GEM derivative liability (see Note 10. Fair Value Measurements). For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a change in fair value of million related to the Mandatory Convertible Security, resulting in a liability of million as of September 30, 2024, which was included as part of other long-term liabilities within the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 Southern Acquisition 
 On July 27, 2023 (the Acquisition Date ), immediately prior to the Company s listing on the NYSE and after the consummation of the Internal Reorganization, the Company effected the acquisition of all equity interests of Southern Airways Corporation Southern ), whereby a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company merged with and into Southern, after which Southern became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the Southern Acquisition ). Pursuant to the Southern Acquisition, Southern stockholders received 2,321,429 shares of the Company s common stock. 
 Southern, a Delaware corporation founded on April 5, 2013, and its wholly owned subsidiaries Southern Airways Express, LLC, Southern Airways Pacific, Southern Airways Autos, LLC, and Multi-Aero Inc. are collectively referred to hereafter as Southern. Southern is a scheduled service commuter airline serving cities across the United States that is headquartered in Palm Beach, Florida and commenced flight operations in June 2013. It is a certified Part 135 operator which operates a fleet of over 50 aircraft, including the Cessna Caravan, the Cessna Grand Caravan, the Saab 340, the Pilatus PC-12, and the Tecnam Traveller. Southern provides both seasonal and full-year scheduled passenger air transportation service in the Mid-Atlantic and Gulf regions, Rockies and West Coast, and Hawaii, with select routes subsidized by the United States Department of Transportation U.S. DOT under the Essential Air Service EAS program. 
 The Southern Acquisition resulted in a combined regional airline network servicing U.S. cities across the Mid-Atlantic, Gulf South, Midwest, Rocky Mountains, West Coast, New England and Hawaii. 
 The results of operations of Southern are included in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition, July 27, 2023, through September 30, 2024. For historical financial information of Southern, prior to the Acquisition Date, refer to the sections entitled Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for Southern Airways Corporation and Audited Financial Statements for Southern Airways Corporation as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and for the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 in the Company s Registration Statement on Form S-1 filed with the SEC on November 9, 2023 (the Registration Statement ), as well as the Form 8-K/A filed August 29, 2023. 
 Operating Environment 
 The Company is developing fully-electric and hybrid-electric powertrain technologies with its commercial partners to electrify existing fleets and new aircraft. Additionally, the Company has been incurring expenses to support the development of the technology of its digital platform with the aim of enabling the regional air-mobility market to operate at scale and to enhance the user s ability to make informed decisions based on multiple first and third party data sources as well as connected aircraft. As a result, the Company expects to incur significant costs in the future to support the development of this technology. 
 Beginning in early 2020, the effects and potential effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic, including, but not limited to, its impact on general economic conditions, trade and financing markets, changes in customer behavior with regard to air mobility services, and continuity in business operations created significant uncertainty for the Company. The Company has seen some recovery in on-demand flights through the third quarter of 2024, however the Company s business has been and will continue to be affected by many changing economic and other conditions beyond the Company s control, including global events that affect travel behavior. The spread of COVID-19 also disrupted the manufacturing, delivery and overall supply chain of aircraft manufacturers and suppliers and has led to a global decrease in aircraft sales in markets around the world. The Company has experienced inflationary pressures, which have materially increased the Company s costs for aircraft fuel, wages and benefits and other goods and services critical to its operations during 2023 and through the third quarter of 2024 and believes perceived recessionary risks may impact results for the remainder of 2024. For example, perceived recessionary risks may cause companies and individuals to reduce travel for either professional or personal reasons, and drive higher prices in the supply chain the Company relies upon. In addition, the Company incurred greater than expected losses and negative cash flows from operating activities through the third quarter of 2024 due to inefficient aircraft utilization, primarily caused by an underutilization of pilots and a shortage of maintenance personnel and critical aircraft components, which, in aggregate, have challenged the Company s ability to serve its customers as desired and, in turn, cover expenses. 
 As such, the extent to which global events and market inflationary impacts will affect our financial condition, liquidity and future results of operations is uncertain. Given the uncertainty regarding the length of these factors, the Company cannot reasonably estimate their impact on its future results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. The Company continues to actively monitor its financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry and workforce. As the Company does not currently, and does not intend in the foreseeable future to, enter into any transactions to hedge fuel costs, or otherwise fix labor costs, the Company will continue to be fully exposed to fluctuations in prices of material operating costs.

Scheduled revenue increased 6.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Scheduled revenue, absent the impact of the Southern Acquisition, decreased by roughly 0.3 million, primarily due to a decrease in membership subscription revenue, from a lower overall membership usage. The increase in scheduled revenue was primarily due to an increase of 18 in scheduled passengers and an 33 increase in scheduled departures, primarily due to the timing of the Southern Acquisition in 2023 and a full three-months of operations in the 2024 period. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Cost of Revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization 
 Cost of revenue increased by 6.9 million, or 33 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in scheduled services noted above, primarily due to the timing of the Southern Acquisition in 2023 and a full three-months of operations in the 2024 period. 
 Technology and Development 
 Technology and development expenses increased by 2.8 million, or 98 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was driven primarily by accruals pertaining to the Textron data license of 3.1 million, partially offset by a decrease in labor and labor related expenses for the technology team of 0.3 million due to a decrease in headcount. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 3.2 million, or 72 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease of 2.2 million in employee compensation and commission expenses, due to a reduced headcount and a decrease in brand awareness and digital marketing expenses of 1.0 million, which was incurred during the lead up to the Company s direct listing in the 2023 period. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses decreased by 55.2 million, or 99 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in general and administrative expense is driven primarily by a 37.9 million reduction in stock-based compensation expense, primarily due to the recognition of 22.6 million in listing day RSPA vesting and a 14.7 million reduction in expenses related to the Management Incentive Plan, a 15.3 million reduction in transaction related expenses pertaining to the Company s direct listing in July 2023, and accrual reductions related to incentive bonus plans of 3.6 million. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by 0.8 million, or 56 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily due overall increases in aircraft depreciation due to capital expenditures subsequent to the 2023 period. 
 38 

Other Income/(Expense) 
 Other expense, net decreased by 11.6 million, or 76 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily attributable to a 9.6 million decrease in losses from changes in fair value of financial instruments, due to a significant amount of financial instruments converting to common stock as of the direct listing, and a 3.1 million reduction in other loss due to 3.1 million in contract settlement expense pertaining to the Company s July 2023 direct listing. This was partially offset by a 1.2 million increase in interest expense due to an overall higher debt Southern Acquisition, other expenses increased by 0.6 million primarily attributable to interest expense associated with the debt instruments acquired from Southern. 
 Net Loss 
 The decrease in net loss of 62.4 million, or 84 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue of 6.4 million, decreases in general and administrative expenses of 55.2 million, decreases in sales and marketing expense of 3.2 million, and decreases in other expense of 11.6 million. These decreases in expenses were offset by increases in cost of revenue of 6.9 million, increases in technology and development expenses of 2.8 million, increases in depreciation and amortization of 0.8 million, and a decrease of 3.6 million in income tax benefit.

Revenue 
 Revenue increased by 57.7 million, 171 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenue was attributable to the following changes in scheduled and on-demand revenues (in thousands, except percentages):

Scheduled revenue increased 52.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Scheduled revenue, absent the impacts of the acquisition of Southern, increased by roughly 0.3 million primarily due to a higher recognized usage of membership subscription revenue. Of the increase in scheduled revenue, 51.9 million was related to the Southern Acquisition, primarily related to EAS revenue of 29.5 million, passenger revenue of 20.8 million, and other revenue of 1.6 million as a result of only including operating results for the period of July 27, 2023 through September 30, 2023 as a result of the Southern Acquisition. On-Demand revenue increased by 5.7 million, or 35 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company conducted 2,721 on-demand flights during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and absent the impact of the acquisition of Southern, the Company conducted 1,916 on-demand charter flights during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,617 on-demand charter flights during the the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in on-demand charter flights was driven by increases in marketing efforts for our on-demand product. Price per trip increased slightly during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by a shift in customer preference to more expensive aircraft to service charter trips in 2024, accounting for roughly 3.8 million, or 67 of the total on-demand revenue increase period over period. 
 With the Southern Acquisition, on-demand revenue increased 1.9 million, or 33 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily from Hawaii based operations focusing on providing charter services for construction crews, school events, and leisure travel. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Cost of Revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization 
 Cost of revenue increased by 49.4 million, or 144 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Of the total 2,721on-demand charter flights, and absent the impact of the acquisition of Southern, the Company serviced 1,916 on-demand charter flights in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase from 1,617 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, resulting in a 5.1 million increase, or 10 , in cost of revenue associated with the Company s on-demand charter flights. Of the total 51,483 scheduled flight hours, and absent the impact of the acquisition of Southern, the Company flew 1,253 flight hours in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease from 2,629 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, resulting in a 0.8 million decrease, or 2 of the total. 
 With the Southern Acquisition, cost of revenue increased by 45.4 million, or 92 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to aircraft expenses of 25.4 million, pilot expenses of 11.1 million, customer care expenses of 5.7 million, station expenses of 1.8 million, and reservation system cost of 1.0 million, and passenger re-accommodation expenses of 0.4 million. 
 Technology and Development 
 Technology and development expenses increased by 13.9 million, or 308 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was driven primarily by amounts accrued pertaining to the Textron data license of 9.4 million, expenses related to work with Palantir for 4.1 million, and increases in software platform and electrification development expenses for 1.3 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in labor and labor related expenses for the technology team of 0.9 million due to a decrease in headcount. 
 40 

Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 1.0 million, or 12 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in brand awareness and strategic digital marketing expenses of 0.5 million and a 0.9 million decrease in management incentive plan expenses due to reduced headcount. 
 With the Southern Acquisition, sales and marketing expenses increased by 0.4 million primarily attributable to marketing for scheduled revenue. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses decreased by 28.7 million, or 39 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in general and administrative expense is driven primarily by 20.7 million reduction in stock-based compensation expense, and a decrease of 19.3 million in transaction related costs associated with the Company s direct listing in July 2023. Partially offset by a increase in non-direct listing professional fees of 2.9 million due to a higher volume of corporate transactions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 With the Southern Acquisition, general and administrative expenses increased by 9.7 million primarily attributable to labor expenses, professional fees, insurance, utilities, rent and travel. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by 4.3 million, or 229 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily due to depreciation of engines and aircraft acquired from Southern, as well as amortization of intangibles acquired in the Southern Acquisition. 
 Other Income/(Expense) 
 Other expense, net decreased by 47.1 million, or 86 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. There are two primary drivers for the increase in net income/(expense). 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was a decrease of 1.9 million in fair value of financial debt instruments, including SAFE notes and certain convertible notes which resulted in a 47.5 million decrease in expense period over period. 
 There was an increase in interest expense of 4.0 million period over period, due to additional related party term loans and interest associated with aircraft term loan assumed as part of the Southern Acquisition. 
 Other expense decreased by 3.3 million due to 3.1 million in contract settlement expense pertaining to the Company s July 2023 direct listing. 
 Net Loss 
 The decrease in net loss of 63.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributable to a decrease in general and administrative expenses of 28.7 million and a decrease of 47.5 million in changes in fair market value of financial instruments. These decreases in expenses were offset by increases in technology and development expenses of 13.9 million.

 Cash Flow from Investing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 4.5 million, a decrease of 6.7 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven by a decrease of 9.0 million of property and equipment costs, offset by a 1.6 million increase in capitalized software development costs and a 0.7 million decrease in cash received as a result of the Southern Acquisition. 
 Cash Flow from Financing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 33.9 million due to proceeds from borrowings from related parties of 29.7 million, net proceeds of 2.8 million from collateralized borrowings, and proceeds from the GEM stock purchase agreement of 3.9 million, partially offset by 2.3 million in principal payments on long-term debt. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was 62.1 million, primarily due to proceeds from the GEM Purchase of 25 million, proceeds from the GEM stock purchase agreement of 4.5 million, borrowings from related parties of 16.5 million, borrowings from convertible notes of 8 million, proceeds from the issuance of SAFE instruments of 3.7 million, and proceeds from the issuance of preferred shares of 3.0 million. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities decreased period over period by 28.2 million, primarily driven by reductions in proceeds from the GEM Purchase of 25.0 million and a 3.7 million reduction in proceeds from SAFE instruments. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Company has incurred losses from operations, negative cash flows from operating activities and has a working capital deficit. In addition, the Company is currently in default of certain excise and property taxes as well as certain debt obligations. These tax and debt obligations are classified as current liabilities on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. On May 15, 2018, the Company received a notice of a tax lien filing from the Internal Revenue Service IRS for unpaid federal excise taxes for the quarterly periods beginning October 2016 through September 2017 in the amount of 1.9 million, including penalties and interest as of the date of the notice. The Company agreed to a payment plan (the Installment Plan whereby the IRS would take no further action and remove such liens at the time such amounts have been paid. In 2019, the Company defaulted on the Installment Plan. Defaulting on the Installment Plan can result in the IRS nullifying such plan, placing the Company in default and taking collection action against the Company for any unpaid balance. The Company s total outstanding federal excise tax liability including accrued penalties and interest of 7.7 million is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024. During June 2024, the Company submitted a formal offer-in-compromise 
 42 

OIC to the IRS, seeking to resolve all excise tax liabilities. Under the terms of the OIC, all collection actions against the Company, in relation to these matters, will be abated and the Company will be making monthly payments of 34 thousand on historical excise tax liabilities while the IRS is considering the OIC. The Company has also defaulted on its property tax obligations in various California counties in relation to fixed assets, plane usage and aircraft leases. The Company s total outstanding property tax liability including penalties and interest is approximately 1.8 million as of September 30, 2024. The Company received a net credit of 0.3 million as a result of the property tax audit, which concluded in June 2024. Additionally, Los Angeles County has imposed a tax lien on four of the Company s leased aircraft due to the late filing of the Company s 2022 property tax return. As of September 30, 2024, the amount of property tax, interest and penalties accrued related to the Los Angeles County tax lien for all unpaid tax years was approximately 1.2 million. The Company is in the process of remediating the late filing and payment of the property taxes due to Los Angeles County. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was also in default of the Simple Agreements for Future Equity with Token allocation SAFE-T note, where the note matured in July 2019. The SAFE-T note is subordinate to the Company s Convertible Note Purchase Agreement; therefore, the Company cannot pay the outstanding balance prior to paying amounts due under the Convertible Note Purchase Agreement (as defined below). The SAFE-T note had an outstanding principal amount of 0.5 million as of September 30, 2024 (see Note 8, Financing Arrangements ). 
 In connection with past due rental and maintenance payments under certain aircraft leases totaling in aggregate approximately 5.0 million, which is accrued for at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company entered into a payment plan pursuant to which all payments of the past due amounts are deferred until such time as the Company receives at least 30.0 million in aggregate funds in connection with any capital contribution, at which time it is required to repay 1.0 million of such past due payments, with the eventual full repayment of the remaining amounts being required upon the receipt of at least 50.0 million in capital contributions. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has classified 1.0 million as a current liability as potentially triggered by capital contributions received as follows: the funds received by the Company of 8.0 million under a convertible note purchase agreement with Partners for Growth V, L.P. PFG ), 25.0 million through the share purchase agreement with GEM Global Yield LLC SCS GEM ), and an entity affiliated with GEM that provides incremental financing (the GEM Purchase ), and 14 million in cumulative funding through advances and share draws under the Share Purchase Agreement with GEM. As of September 30, 2024 the Company has not made any payments under this payment plan. 

The airline industry and the Company s operations are cyclical and highly competitive. The Company s success is largely dependent on the ability to raise debt and equity capital, achieve a high level of aircraft and crew utilization, increase flight services and the number of passengers flown, and continue to profitably expand into regions throughout the United States. 
 
 The Company s prospects and ongoing business activities are subject to the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving markets. Risks and uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect the Company s business, results of operations or financial condition include, but are not limited to, the ability to: (i) raise additional capital (or financing) to fund operating losses, (ii) refinance its current outstanding debt, (iii) maintain efficient aircraft utilization, primarily through the proper utilization of pilots and managing market shortages of maintenance personnel and critical aircraft components, (iv) sustain ongoing operations, (v) attract and maintain customers, (vi) integrate, manage and grow recent acquisitions and new business initiatives, (vii) obtain and maintain relevant regulatory approvals, and (viii) measure and manage risks inherent to the business model. 
 
 Prior to the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company has funded its operations and capital needs primarily through the net proceeds received from the issuance of various debt instruments, convertible securities, related party funding, and preferred and common share financing arrangements. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company received 8.0 million under a convertible note purchase agreement (the Convertible Note Purchase Agreement with PFG, 25.0 million through the GEM Purchase Agreement and 10.2 million in advances under the second amended and restated Share Purchase Agreement with GEM (see Note 9, Share Purchase Agreement, GEM Purchase, and Mandatory Convertible Security ). The Company had previously filed a Form S-1 registration statement (File No. 333-274573) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), registering up to 3,571,429 million shares of the Company s common stock, which represents 142,857 shares of the Company s common stock issued to GEM under the GEM Purchase Agreement, 185,714 shares of the Company s common stock issued to GEM in connection with the initial issuance to GEM under the Share Purchase Agreement, 571,429 shares of the Company s common stock issued to GEM in satisfaction of the commitment fee under the Share Purchase Agreement, and up to 2,671,429 shares of the Company s common stock to be issued to GEM in connection with the Share Purchase Agreement. Additionally, the Company had previously filed a Form S-1 registration statement (File No. 333-275434) with the SEC, registering up to 42.9 million shares of the Company s common stock, which represents the balance of the full amount of shares of common stock that the Company estimated could be issued and sold to GEM for advances under the Share Purchase Agreement, plus the amount of shares the Company estimated could be sold to GEM for 50.0 million under the Share Purchase Agreement, (collectively, the Prior Registration Statements ). In connection with the GEM Mandatory Convertible Security (see Note 9, Share Purchase Agreement, GEM Purchase, and Mandatory Convertible Security ), the Company deregistered all of the shares registered but unsold under the Prior Registration Statements on June 4, 2024. The combined 46,428,571 shares contemplated under the Prior Registration Statements have been included in a Form S-1 Registration Statement (File No. 333-279929), which was declared effective by the SEC on August 7, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the contractual terms allow the Company to make further advances of up to 97.5 million under the Share Purchase Agreement with GEM. Additionally, the Company has the ability to draw an additional 298.6 million, subject to daily volume limitations and GEM s requirement to hold less than 10 of the fully-diluted shares of the Company, with shares obtained in the satisfaction of draws under the SPA. As of September 30, 2024, GEM held 9.4 of the then fully-diluted shares of the Company. At September 30, 2024, the daily volume limitations under the SPA restricted our ability to take 
 43 

additional draws under the Share Purchase Agreement to approximately 686 thousand shares per draw. Additionally, the availability of the Share Purchase Agreement is contingent on the Company s common stock being listed on a national exchange. As of September, 2024, the Company is attempting to resolve one listing requirement violation with the NYSE. While not currently subject to de-listing, the Company s inability to cure this listing requirement violation would impact its continued ability to raise capital through the Share Purchase Agreement. 
 
 The Company is currently implementing operational improvements and stringent operating expenses management to improve the profitability of its airline operations. In parallel, the Company is advancing its technology initiatives, including its software technology platform and Caravan electrification programs. In addition, the Company continues to evaluate strategies to obtain additional funding for future operations. These strategies may include, but are not limited to, obtaining additional equity financing, issuing additional debt or entering into other financing arrangements, forming joint ventures and other partnerships, and restructuring of operations to grow revenues and decrease expenses. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in achieving its strategic plans or that new financing will be available to the Company in a timely manner or on acceptable terms, if at all. If the Company is unable to raise sufficient financing when needed or events or circumstances occur such that the Company does not meet its strategic plans, the Company will be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but are not necessarily limited to, reducing certain spending, altering or scaling back development plans, including plans to equip regional airline operations with fully-electric or hybrid-electric aircraft, or reducing funding of capital expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and ability to achieve its intended business objectives. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Company's condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The going concern assumption contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. 
 The Company s capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were limited to payments made for aircraft parts, engines, immaterial purchases and internally developed software. Upon the Company s ability to utilize the SPA or obtain alternative funding, the Company intends to invest significantly in expansion of its network footprint and in development of electrified powertrain technology and its commercial platform. Expansion of the network will require acquisition of aircraft over the next five years with an expected cost of approximately 1.2 billion. The Company has placed an order with TAI for 90 Cessna Grand Caravan aircraft with an option for an additional 26 Cessna Grand Caravan aircraft, with expected delivery taken over the next five years. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has made deposits of 2.0 million for aircraft that are scheduled to be delivered starting in the fourth quarter of 2024. The Company intends to finance these aircraft through Jetstream Aviation Capital, with which the Company currently has a sale-leaseback financing arrangement of up to 450 million, and additional debt and/or leasing facilities that it intends to obtain in the event sale-leaseback financing is not available through Jetstream Aviation Capital. See the section entitled Risk Factors Risks Related to SAM s Financial Position and Capital Requirements SAM has no operating history. Surf Air and Southern s past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of SAM s future success included within the Company s Form 10-K filed on March 29, 2024 . The Company has engaged AeroTEC to develop hybrid-electric and fully electric STCs for the Cessna Grand Caravan in partnership with TAI. A portion of these costs are expected to be funded through the SPA. 
 Commitments 
 The Company has entered into various contractual arrangements related to the build-out of the Company s air service fleet, the development of its proprietary hybrid and electric aircraft technology, and the build out of its aircraft as a service platform. These arrangements include commitments for payments pursuant to licensing agreements, which routinely contain provisions for guarantees or minimum expenditures during the terms of the contracts. The Company also enters into long-term debt arrangements that include periodic interest and principal payments. Additionally, the Company routinely enters into noncancelable lease agreements for aircraft and operating locations, which contain minimum rental payments. 
 The timing and nature of these commitments are expected to have an impact on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods. Refer to the Notes to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 for additional information relating to our long-term debt, operating and finance leases, related party term notes, and commitments. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). 
 44 

Use of Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet date, as well as reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Our most significant estimates and judgments involve difficult, subjective, or complex judgments made by management. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows will be affected. We had no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 JOBS Act 
 The Company currently qualifies as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. Accordingly, the Company has elected to use the extended transition period for complying with any new or revised financial accounting standards provided pursuant to Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act. The Company s utilization of these transition periods may make it difficult to compare our financial statements to those of non-emerging growth companies and other emerging growth companies that have opted out of the transition periods afforded under the JOBS Act. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 In the ordinary course of operating our business, we are exposed to market risks. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position or results of operations due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Except as indicated below, there has been no material change in our exposure to market risk from that described in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act), that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. It should be noted that, because of inherent limitations, our disclosure controls and procedures, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at a reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024, due to presence of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below. 
 Notwithstanding the pending remediation efforts described below, based on additional analysis and other post-closing procedures performed, our management believes that the financial statements included in this report present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP. 
 
 Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 As of September 30, 2024, material weaknesses existed in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses are as follows: 
 
 We did not design and maintain an effective control environment commensurate with our financial reporting requirements. Specifically, we lacked a sufficient complement of resources with (i) an appropriate level of accounting knowledge, training and experience to appropriately analyze, record and disclose accounting matters timely and accurately, and (ii) an appropriate level of knowledge and experience to establish effective processes and controls. Additionally, the lack of a sufficient complement of resources resulted in an inability to consistently establish appropriate authorities and responsibilities in pursuit of our financial reporting objectives, as demonstrated by, among other things, insufficient segregation of duties in our finance and accounting functions. 

45 

We did not design and maintain effective controls in response to the risks of material misstatement. Specifically, changes to existing controls or the implementation of new controls have not been sufficient to respond to changes to the risks of material misstatement to financial reporting. 

These material weaknesses contributed to the following additional material weaknesses: 
 
 We did not design and maintain effective controls related to the identification of and accounting for certain non-routine, unusual or complex transactions, including the proper application of U.S. GAAP of such transactions. Specifically, we did not design and maintain effective controls to timely identify and account for capitalizable costs, revenue, stock-based compensation, and debt and equity financing transactions. 

We did not design and maintain effective controls related to the period-end financial reporting process, including designing and maintaining formal accounting policies, procedures and controls to achieve complete, accurate and timely financial accounting, reporting and disclosures. Additionally, we did not design and maintain effective controls over the preparation and review of account reconciliations and journal entries, including maintaining appropriate segregation of duties. 

We did not design and maintain effective information technology IT general controls for information systems that are relevant to the preparation of our financial statements. Specifically, we did not design and maintain: (i) program change management controls to ensure that program and data changes are identified, tested, authorized, and implemented appropriately; (ii) user access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and to adequately restrict user and privileged access to appropriate personnel ; (iii) computer operations controls to ensure that processing and transfer of data, and data backups and recovery are monitored ; and (iv) program development controls to ensure that new software development is tested, authorized and implemented appropriately . 

These material weaknesses resulted in audit adjustments to substantially all of our accounts, which were recorded prior to the issuance of the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 and for the years then-ended, and as of June 30, 2022 and 2021 and for the six-month periods then ended. Subsequently, these material weaknesses also resulted in audit adjustments to revenue, deferred revenue, accrued expenses, additional paid-in capital and stock-based compensation expense to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022 and 2023 and for the years then-ended. These material weaknesses also resulted in misstatements to prepaid expenses and other current assets and sales and marketing to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, these material weaknesses could result in a misstatement of substantially all of our accounts or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 
 Additionally, with the closing of the Southern Acquisition, and the continued integration of associated operations and processes into those of the Company, the following material weakness in internal control over financial reporting has also been identified, after considering alignment with previous material weaknesses identified and outlined above: 
 
 We did not design and maintain effective controls to achieve complete, accurate and timely accounting for debt, deferred liabilities, leases, property and equipment, redeemable convertible preferred shares, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities. This material weakness did not result in adjustments to our consolidated financial statements. However, this material weakness could result in a misstatement of the aforementioned accounts or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 

Additionally, prior to our acquisition of Southern, Southern reported multiple material weaknesses related to its control environment, risks of material misstatement, period-end financial reporting and IT general controls in our Form S-1 filed on September 19, 2023. Those material weaknesses resulted in audit adjustments to substantially all of Southern s accounts, which were recorded prior to the issuance of the consolidated financial statements of Southern as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 and for the years then-ended. Subsequently, those material weaknesses also resulted in a revision to the previously issued consolidated financial statements of Southern as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and for the years then-ended, and the interim periods ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, to correct for errors in revenues and deferred revenues. Also, in connection with the preparation of Southern s financial statements for the interim period ended March 31, 2023, Southern identified an error related to the accounting for prepaid passenger ticket deposits. Southern s management determined that this error was the result of the previously reported material weaknesses. This error was corrected in Southern s financial statements as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and for the years then-ended and the interim periods ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 as a revision to previously issued financial statements. 
 Remediation Plans to Address Material Weaknesses 
 To date, we have developed a plan to address the material weaknesses identified above. This remediation plan consists primarily of: (i) adding key personnel to strengthen the Company s financial reporting processes, (ii) improving our internal controls around 
 46 

financial systems and processes, (iii) formalizing internal controls related to the identification of and accounting for certain non-routine, unusual or complex transactions, including the proper application of U.S. GAAP to such transactions, (iv) engaging a third party to assist in identifying risks of material misstatement and designing and implementing controls to address the identified risks of material misstatement, and (v) designing and operating computer operations, program and system development, and user access and change management controls. We intend to take additional steps to remediate the deficiencies identified above and further evolve our internal controls and processes. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Except for changes related to our integration of Southern s operations, control processes and information systems into our systems and control environment and changes related to our remediation plans to address our material weaknesses discussed above, there were no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We are currently in the process of integrating Southern s operations, control processes and information systems into our systems and control environment. 
 Inherent Limitation on the Effectiveness of Internal Control over Financial Reporting and Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, including our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected or preventable.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1. LE GAL PROCEEDINGS 
 From time to time, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of business. Except as set out in Item 1 Financial Statements - Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Contingencies, we are not currently party to any legal proceedings, the outcome of which, if determined adversely, we believe would individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 ITEM 1A. RIS K FACTORS 
 Except as disclosed below and as previously disclosed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Agreements governing our debt obligations include financial and other covenants that provide limitations on our business and operations under certain circumstances, and failure to comply with any of the covenants in such agreements could adversely impact us. 
 
 Our current and any future financing agreements that we may enter into from time to time, contain certain affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and other customary events of default. Under certain circumstances, such covenants require us to maintain minimum liquidity levels, limit our ability to enter into certain strategic transactions, make certain investments, pay dividends and make certain other specified restricted payments. Certain covenants in our financing agreements are subject to important exceptions, qualifications and cure rights, including, under limited circumstances, the requirement to provide additional collateral or prepay or redeem certain obligations. In addition, certain of our financing agreements are cross-collateralized, such that an event of default or acceleration of indebtedness under one agreement could result in an event of default under other financing agreements. If we fail to comply with such covenants, if any other events of default occur for which no waiver or amendment is obtained, or if we are unable to timely refinance the debt obligations subject to such covenants or take other mitigating actions, the holders of our indebtedness could, among other things, declare outstanding amounts immediately due and payable and, subject to the terms of relevant financing agreements, repossess or foreclose on collateral, including certain of our aircraft or other assets used in our business. The acceleration of significant indebtedness or actions to repossess or foreclose on collateral may cause us to renegotiate, repay or refinance the affected obligations, and there is no assurance that such efforts would be successful or on terms we deem attractive. In addition, any acceleration or actions to repossess or foreclose on collateral under our financing agreements could result in a downgrade of any credit ratings then applicable to us, which could result in additional events of default or limit our ability to obtain additional financing. 
 
 For example, the Company s 4-year credit agreement with certain affiliates of Comvest Partners, as lenders, is backstopped by a letter of credit issued by HSBC Bank USA, N.A. and arranged by Park Lane Investments, LLC, which is an entity owned by a family member of a co-founder of the Company (the Credit Support Provider ). In connection with the foregoing, the Company is party to a senior secured reimbursement agreement with the Credit Support Provider (the Reimbursement Agreement to, among other things, reimburse the Credit Support Provider for the costs of the letter of credit, and any amounts for which the letter of credit is drawn. The Reimbursement Agreement contains covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company to: (i) acquire or dispose of assets or businesses; (ii) incur additional indebtedness or liens; (iii) make cash distributions; and (iv) prepay outstanding debt, and otherwise restrict corporate activities of the Company without the consent of the Credit Support Provider. The Reimbursement Agreement also requires the Company to maintain a certain level of minimum liquidity and to limit variance to cash flow projections. Economic conditions and other variables could result in the inability of the Company to satisfy the requirements under the Reimbursement Agreement, could result in one or more events of default thereunder. 
 ITEM 2. UNREGISTERE D SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 Except as previously disclosed in the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 8, 2024, there have been no unregistered sales of equity securities during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 Entry into Reimbursement Agreement 
 On November 14, 2024, in connection with the letter of credit backstopping the Credit Agreement, the Company entered into a Reimbursement Agreement with Credit Support Provider (the Reimbursement Agreement ), which contains certain representations and warranties, covenants and events of default. 
 If the backstop letter of credit is drawn, the Company will be required to reimburse the Credit Support Provider for the drawn amount of the letter of credit, pay interest to the Credit Support Provider at 15.00 per annum on such drawn amounts (subject to increase in the event of default).

 This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the form of the Reimbursement Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 10.4 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Entry into LamVen Note 
 On November 14, 2024, the Company entered into a note exchange agreement with LamVen pursuant to which the Company issued a secured convertible promissory note (the LamVen Note in aggregate principal amount of 50.0 million to LamVen LLC, an entity owned by a co-founder of the Company LamVen ), to refinance certain existing notes. 
 The LamVen Note will accrue interest at the greater of (x) SOFR (subject to a 1.00 floor) plus 5.00 and (y) 9.75 (subject to increase in the event of default). In the event the Company raises capital in certain equity offerings, a portion of the net cash proceeds 
 49 

from such equity offerings and the net cash proceeds from certain asset sales are required to be applied to repay the obligations under the LamVen Note. The maturity of the LamVen Note is December 31, 2028, which may be accelerated upon the occurrence of certain events of default.

 (b)	 Closing Payment . Borrower shall pay the Closing Payment to Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders based on their Pro Rata Shares thereof, on the Closing Date upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement as compensation for the making of the Initial Term Loan on the Closing Date. The Closing Payment shall be deemed fully earned on the Closing Date, subject to the occurrence of the Closing Date, and shall not be refundable in whole or in part and shall not be subject to reduction or set-off under any circumstances. The parties agree that for federal and state income tax purposes, the Closing Payment shall be treated as an adjustment to issue price of the Loans in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.1273-2(g)(2), and the parties will file all their tax returns (including information returns) in a manner consistent with this Section 2.02(b) unless there is a determination within the meaning of Code section 1313 to the contrary. 
 (c)	 Agency Fee . Borrower shall pay to Agent, for its own account, a fully earned and non-refundable annual administrative fee of 50,000 per annum, which fee will be due and payable in advance in equal quarterly installments of 12,500, commencing on the Closing Date (which installment shall be pro-rated for the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the last day of the calendar 
 - 17 - 

quarter ending December 31, 2024) and then on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter occurring thereafter (the Agency Fee ). 
 (d)	 [Reserved] . 
 (e)	 [Reserved] . 
 (f)	 Prepayment Premium . In the event of any repayment or prepayment of all or any portion of the Loans for any reason whatsoever prior to the eighteen (18)-month anniversary of the Closing Date (including without limitation as a result of any acceleration of all or any portion of the Loans, or termination or reduction of all or any portion of the Commitments, resulting from an Event of Default, a foreclosure and sale or other disposition of Collateral, any sale of Collateral in any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, a voluntary prepayment, and in each case, whether before or after the occurrence of an Event of Default or the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, and notwithstanding any acceleration (for any reason) of all or any portion of the Obligations) each, an Applicable Prepayment Event ), in addition to the payment of the subject principal amount and all unpaid accrued and unpaid interest thereon, Borrower shall be required to pay to Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders based on their respective Pro Rata Shares thereof, a prepayment premium (as liquidated damages and compensation for the costs of the Lenders being prepared to make funds available hereunder with respect to the Loans) in an amount (which shall not be less than zero) equal to (the Prepayment Premium the monthly interest rate with respect to the Loans that would be due and owing pursuant to Section 2.02(a)(i) for each full calendar month ending after the Applicable Prepayment Event and the resulting prepayment of the Loans (without duplication of any accrued unpaid interest required to be paid in connection with such prepayment) through and including the eighteen (18)-month anniversary of the Closing Date . The Prepayment Premium shall be deemed fully earned, and be immediately due and payable, upon the date that the Applicable Prepayment Event occurs (regardless of whether or not all or any portion of the principal amount (or of the Aggregate Delayed Draw Term Loan Commitment) subject to such Applicable Prepayment Event has then been paid or otherwise terminated), and shall not be refundable in whole or in part and shall not be subject to reduction or set-off under any circumstances. Borrower acknowledges and agrees that (x) the provisions of this Section 2.02(f) shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any rescission by Agent or Required Lenders of an acceleration with respect to all or any portion of the Obligations pursuant to Section 7.02 or otherwise (provided, that to the extent of any such rescission, any subsequently charged Prepayment Premium shall not be in duplication of any Prepayment Premium previously paid), (y) payment of any Prepayment Premium under this clause Section 2.02(f) constitutes liquidated damages and not a penalty and (z) the actual amount of damages to Agent and the Lenders or profits lost by Agent and the Lenders as a result of such prepayment would be impracticable and extremely difficult to ascertain, and the Prepayment Premium under this Section 2.02(f) is provided by mutual agreement of Borrower, Agent and Lenders as to a reasonable estimation and calculation of such lost profits or damages of Agent and the Lenders. THE BORROWER EXPRESSLY WAIVES THE PROVISIONS OF ANY PRESENT OR FUTURE STATUTE OR LAW THAT PROHIBITS OR MAY PROHIBIT THE COLLECTION OF ANY PREPAYMENT PREMIUM IN CONNECTION WITH ANY ACCELERATION OF ANY OR ALL THE OBLIGATIONS. Borrower expressly agrees that (A) any Prepayment Premium payable in accordance with this Section 2.02(f) shall be presumed to be equal to the liquidated damages sustained by Agent and the Lenders as a result of the occurrence of each Applicable Prepayment Event, (B) the amount of any Prepayment Premium payable under this Section 2.02(f) is reasonable under the circumstances currently existing and is the product of an arm s length transaction between sophisticated business people, ably represented by counsel, (C) the Prepayment Premium shall be payable notwithstanding the then prevailing market rates at the time payment is made, (D) there has been a course of conduct among Agent, Lenders and Borrower giving specific consideration in this transaction for such agreement to pay the Prepayment Premium, (E) Borrower shall be estopped hereafter from claiming differently than agreed to in this Section 2.02(f), (F) Borrower s agreement to pay the Prepayment Premium is a material inducement to Agent and the Lenders to make the 
 - 18 - 

Loans and provide the Loans and Commitments, (G) Agent and the Lenders may include the Prepayment Premium payable under this Section 2.02(f) in any applicable bankruptcy or insolvency claim filed with respect to Borrower, and (H) the Prepayment Premium represents a good faith, reasonable estimate and calculation of the lost profits or damages of Agent and Lenders and it would be impractical and extremely difficult to ascertain the actual amount of damages to Agent and the Lenders or profits lost by Agent and the Lenders as a result of the Applicable Prepayment Event. 
 Section 2.03.	 Use of Proceeds . Borrower shall utilize the proceeds of (i) the Initial Term Loans solely (a) to pay fees and expenses associated with the closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the Closing Date and (b) any amounts not utilized pursuant to clause (a) above may be utilized by Borrower for general corporate purposes and (ii) the proceeds of the Delayed Draw Term Loans may be utilized solely to pay (or to reimburse the Borrower for cash amounts used by the Borrower within thirty (30) days prior to the date of such borrowing to pay) interest to the Lenders in respect of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.02. 
 Section 2.04.	 Further Obligations / Maximum Lawful Rate . With respect to all Obligations for which the interest rate is not otherwise specified herein (whether such Obligations arise hereunder or under other Loan Documents, or otherwise), such Obligations shall bear interest at the highest rate(s) in effect from time to time with respect to the Loans and shall be payable upon demand by Agent. In no event shall the interest or other amounts charged with respect to any Loan or any other Obligation exceed the maximum amount permitted under Applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or elsewhere, if at any time the rate of interest payable or other amounts hereunder or under any other Loan Document (the Stated Rate would exceed the highest rate of interest or other amount permitted under any Applicable Law to be charged (the Maximum Lawful Rate ), then for so long as the Maximum Lawful Rate would be so exceeded, the rate of interest and other amounts payable shall be equal to the Maximum Lawful Rate; provided , that if at any time thereafter the Stated Rate is less than the Maximum Lawful Rate, Borrower shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, continue to pay interest and such other amounts at the Maximum Lawful Rate until such time as the total interest and other such amounts received is equal to the total interest and other such amounts which would have been received had the Stated Rate been (but for the operation of this provision) the interest rate payable or such other amounts payable. Thereafter, the interest rate and such other amounts payable shall be the Stated Rate unless and until the Stated Rate again would exceed the Maximum Lawful Rate, in which event this provision shall again apply. In no event shall the total interest or other such amounts received by Agent or any Lender exceed the amount which it could lawfully have received had the interest and other such amounts been calculated for the full term hereof at the Maximum Lawful Rate. If, notwithstanding the prior sentence, Agent or any Lender has received interest or other such amounts hereunder in excess of the Maximum Lawful Rate, such excess amount shall be applied to the reduction of the principal balance of the Loans or to other Obligations (other than interest) payable hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, and if no such principal or other Obligations are then outstanding, such excess or part thereof remaining shall be paid to Borrower. In computing interest payable with reference to the Maximum Lawful Rate applicable to Agent or any Lender, such interest shall be calculated at a daily rate equal to the Maximum Lawful Rate divided by the number of days in the year in which such calculation is made. 
 Section 2.05.	 Post Event of Default Application of Payments . Upon the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, at the direction of the Required Lenders, all amounts paid or received by Agent in respect of the Obligations, from whatever source (whether from the Security Agreement or any other Loan Document, any realization upon any Collateral, or otherwise) shall by applied by Agent to the Obligations as follows:

 (C)	 THIRD, [reserved]; 
 (D)	 FOURTH, to the payment of all fees, premiums (other than the Prepayment Premium), costs, expenses and indemnities then due and owing to Lenders in respect of the Loans, pro rata based on each Lender s Pro Rata Share thereof, until paid in full; 
 (E)	 FIFTH, to the payment of all accrued and unpaid interest then due and owing to Lenders in respect of the Loans, pro rata based on each Lender s Pro Rata Share thereof, until paid in full; 
 (F)	 SIXTH, pro rata to the payment of all principal of the Loans then due and owing, pro rata based on each Lender s Pro Rata Share thereof, until paid in full; 
 (G)	 SEVENTH, to the payment of the Prepayment Premium then due and owing, pro rata based on each Lender s Pro Rata Share thereof, until paid in full; and 
 (H)	 EIGHTH, pro rata to the payment of all other Obligations then owing, until paid in full; 
 with any remainder paid to Borrower (or whomever may otherwise be lawfully entitled thereto). 
 Section 2.06.	 Obligations Unconditional/Withholding Taxes; Changes in Law . 
 (a)	 Obligations Unconditional/Withholding Taxes . The payment and performance of all Obligations shall constitute the absolute and unconditional obligations of Borrower, and shall be independent of any defense or rights of set-off, recoupment or counterclaim which Borrower or any other Person might otherwise have against Agent, any Lender or any other Person. All payments required (other than by Agent to any Lender, or by Agent or any Lender to Borrower) by this Agreement and/or the other Loan Documents shall be made in Dollars (unless payment in a different currency is expressly provided otherwise in the applicable Loan Document) and paid free of any deductions or withholdings for any Taxes (except as required by Applicable Law) or other amounts and without abatement, diminution or set-off. If Borrower or Agent is required by Applicable Law to make such a deduction or withholding of an Indemnified Tax from a payment hereunder or under any other Loan Document, Borrower shall pay to Agent such additional amount as is necessary to ensure that, after the making of such deduction or withholding, Agent and the Lenders receive (free from any liability in respect of any such deduction or withholding) a net sum equal to the sum which it would have received and so retained had no such deduction or withholding been made or required to be made. Borrower shall (i) pay the full amount of such deduction or withholding, which it is required to make by Applicable Law, to the relevant authority within the payment period set by Applicable Law, and (ii) promptly after any such payment, deliver to Agent an original (or certified copy) of an official receipt issued by the relevant authority in respect of the amount withheld or deducted or, if the relevant authority does not issue such official receipts, such other evidence of payment of the amount withheld or deducted as is reasonably acceptable to Agent. Furthermore, Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant governmental authority in accordance with Applicable Law, or at the option of Agent timely reimburse Agent and the Lenders for the payment of, any Other Taxes.

(b)	 Changes in Law . If, at any time and from time to time after the Closing Date (or at any time before or after the Closing Date with respect to (x) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, regulations, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith shall, regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued, or (y) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States regulatory authorities, in each case for purposes of this clause (y) pursuant to Basel III ), (i) any change in any existing law, regulation, treaty or directive or in the interpretation or application thereof, (ii) any new law, regulation, treaty or directive enacted or application thereof, or (iii) compliance by Agent or any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any governmental authority (A) subjects Agent or any Lender to any Tax with respect to any Loan Document (in each case, except for an Indemnified Tax, taxes described in clauses (b)-(d) of the definition of Excluded Tax or Connection Income Taxes), (B imposes, modifies or deems applicable any reserve (including any reserve imposed by the FRB), special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by Agent or any Lender, or (C) imposes on Agent or any Lender any other condition or increased cost in connection with the transactions contemplated thereby or participations therein, and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to Agent or any Lender of making or continuing any Loan or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder or under any other Loan Documents, then, in any such case, Borrower shall promptly (but not later than ten (10) Business Days following demand) pay to Agent or such Lender, as applicable, when notified to do so by Agent or such Lender, any additional amounts necessary to compensate Agent or such Lender, for such additional cost or reduced amount as determined by Agent or such Lender. Each such notice of additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.06(b) submitted by Agent or any Lender to Borrower must also be sent to Agent and shall, absent manifest or demonstrable error, be final, conclusive and binding for all purposes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Lender shall be entitled to request compensation under this paragraph with respect to any costs imposed on such Lender in respect of a change in law unless such Lender generally seek compensation in similar circumstances under comparable provisions in similarly situated credit facilities, as determined in good faith by such Lender. 
 Section 2.07.	 Taxes . 
 (a)	If a Lender is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document, such Lender shall deliver to Borrower, at the time or times reasonably requested by Borrower, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, Lenders, if reasonably requested by Borrower, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by Borrower as will enable Borrower to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.07(b), (c), and (d) below) shall not be required if in Lender s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. 
 (b)	Each Lender that is not a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) (a Foreign Lender for U.S. federal income tax purposes, to the extent legally entitled to do so, shall execute and deliver to Borrower and Agent, on or prior to the Closing Date (in the case of each Foreign Lender that is a party hereto on the Closing Date) or on or prior to the date of any assignment pursuant to which it becomes a Lender (in the case of each other Foreign Lender) one or more (as Borrower or Agent may reasonably request) IRS Forms W 8ECI, W 8BEN, W 8BEN-E, W 8IMY (as applicable) or other applicable form, certificate or document prescribed by the Code, the Treasury Regulations or the United States Internal Revenue Service certifying as to such Foreign Lender s 
 - 21 - 

entitlement to exemption from, or reduced rate of, withholding or deduction of all relevant taxes, and, in the case of such Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a 10 percent shareholder of Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code. Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this Section 2.07(b) expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify Borrower and Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. 
 (c)	Each Lender and Agent that is a United States person within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to each of Borrower and Agent, as applicable, a duly signed, properly completed IRS Form W-9 (or successor form) on or prior to the Closing Date (or on or prior to the date it otherwise becomes a party hereto), certifying that such Lender is entitled to an exemption from, or is otherwise not subject to, United States backup withholding tax. Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this Section 2.07(c) expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify Borrower and Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. 
 (d)	Each Lender required to deliver any forms, certificates, or other evidence with respect to United States federal income tax withholding matters pursuant to this Section 2.07 hereby agrees, from time to time, after the initial delivery by such Lender of such forms, certificates, or other evidence (and whenever a lapse in time or change in circumstance renders such forms, certificates, or other evidence obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect) to promptly deliver to Agent and Borrower one or more original copies of, as applicable, IRS Forms W-8BEN, W 8BEN-E, W-8ECI, W-8IMY, or W-9, a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E to the effect that such Lender is not (A) a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a 10 percent shareholder of Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code, and such other documentation required by the Code, the regulations issued thereunder, or the United States Internal Revenue Service or otherwise by Applicable Law, all as reasonably requested by Borrower in writing to confirm or establish that such Lender is not subject to deduction or withholding of United States federal income taxation with respect to payments made to such Lender under the Loan Documents. If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Sections 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to Borrower and Agent, at the time or times prescribed by Applicable Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by Borrower or Agent, such documentation prescribed by Applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by Borrower or Agent as may be necessary for Borrower and Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine whether such Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine, if necessary, the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. For the avoidance of doubt, for the purposes of this Section 2.07(d), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 
 (e)	On or before the date Agent becomes a party to this Agreement, Agent shall provide to Borrower, two duly-signed, properly completed copies of the documentation prescribed in clause (i) or (ii) below, as applicable (together with all required attachments thereto): (i) IRS Form W-9 or any successor thereto, or (ii) (A) IRS Form W-8ECI or any successor thereto, and (B) with respect to payments received on account of any Lender, a U.S. branch withholding certificate on IRS Form W-8IMY or any successor thereto evidencing its agreement with Borrower to be treated as a U.S. Person for U.S. federal withholding purposes. At any time thereafter, Agent shall provide updated documentation previously 
 - 22 - 

provided (or a successor form thereto) when any documentation previously delivered has expired or become obsolete or invalid or otherwise upon the reasonable request of Borrower. 
 (f)	Borrower shall indemnify Agent and each Lender for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes arising in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document (including any such Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.07), paid by Agent or each such Lender and any reasonable out-of-pocket third party expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, (including without limitation attorneys fees) whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant governmental authority; provided, however, that Borrower shall not be obligated to make any payment to Agent or any Lender pursuant to this Section 2.07(f) in respect of any penalties (or interest thereon) in respect of any such Taxes to the extent such penalties are finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to directly arise from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent or Lender. 
 (g)	If Agent or a Lender receives a refund (in cash or as a credit applied as payment of Taxes otherwise payable in cash) of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to Sections 2.06 or 2.07, it shall pay to Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under Sections 2.06 and 2.07 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of Agent or Lender, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant governmental authority with respect to such refund); provided, that Borrower shall repay to Agent or such Lender the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant governmental authority) in the event that Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such governmental authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph, in no event will Agent or such Lender be required to pay any amount to Borrower pursuant to this paragraph the payment of which would place Agent or such Lender in a less favorable net after-Tax position than Agent or such Lender would have been in if the tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person. 
 (h)	Agent or a Lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.07 shall use its reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policies and applicable law) to change the jurisdiction of its lending office or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to an Affiliate if such a change or assignment would reduce any such additional amounts (or any similar amount that may thereafter accrue) and would not, in the determination of Agent or such Lender, as applicable, be otherwise disadvantageous to Agent or such Lender. 
 (i)	This Section 2.07 and Section 2.06 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of the expiration or any termination of this Agreement. 
 (j)	The parties hereto intend and agree that the Loans are to be treated as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the issue price of the Initial Term Loan shall be determined under Section 1273(c)(2)(C) of the Code. The parties hereto agree not to take a position inconsistent with this Section 2.07(j) for U.S. federal, state, or local income tax purposes (including without limitation, the filing of any information return, such as an IRS Form 1099), unless there is a determination within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code to the contrary. 
 (k)	If at any time the Borrower becomes obligated to pay any additional amounts pursuant to Section 2.06(b) or this Section 2.07, then the Borrower may, on notice to the Agent and such 
 - 23 - 

Lender, replace such Lender by causing such Lender to (and such Lender shall be obligated to) assign pursuant to Section 8.02 all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more permitted assignees. Any Lender being so replaced pursuant to this clause (k) shall (i) execute and deliver an Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such Lender s applicable Loans, and (ii) deliver any Notes evidencing such Loans to the Borrower or the Agent. Pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, (A) the assignee Lender shall acquire all or a portion, as the case may be, of the assigning Lender s Commitment and outstanding Loans, (B) all obligations of the Borrower owing to the assigning Lender relating to the Loans and Commitments so assigned shall be paid in full at par by the assignee Lender to such assigning Lender concurrently with such Assignment and Acceptance and (C) upon such payment and, if so requested by the assignee Lender, delivery to the assignee Lender of the appropriate Note or Notes executed by the Borrower, the assignee Lender shall become a Lender hereunder and the assigning Lender shall cease to constitute a Lender hereunder with respect to such assigned Loans and Commitments, except with respect to indemnification provisions under this Agreement, which shall survive as to such assigning Lender. 
 Section 2.08.	 Reversal of Payments . To the extent that any payment or payments made to or received by Agent or any Lender pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside, or required to be repaid to any trustee, receiver or other Person under any state, federal or other bankruptcy or other such Applicable Law, then, to the extent thereof, such amounts (and all Liens, rights and remedies therefore) shall be revived as Obligations (and as all such Liens, rights and remedies therefore) and continue in full force and effect under this Agreement and under the other Loan Documents as if such payment or payments had not been received by Agent or such Lender (and all such Liens, rights and remedies therefore had not been released by Agent or such Lender). Furthermore, if Agent determines at any time that any amount received thereby under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document must be returned to Borrower or paid to any other Person pursuant to any state, federal or other bankruptcy or other such Applicable Law or otherwise, then, notwithstanding any other term or condition of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, Agent will not be required to distribute any portion thereof to any Lender. In addition, each Lender will repay to Agent on demand any portion of such amount that Agent has distributed to such Lender, together with interest at such rate, if any, as Agent is required to pay to Borrower or such other Person, without set off, counterclaim or deduction of any kind. This Section 2.08 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of the expiration or any termination of this Agreement or any repayment of the Obligations. 
 Section 2.09.	 Set-Off Rights . Borrower agrees that Agent, each Lender and each of their respective Affiliates have all rights of set-off and bankers lien provided by Applicable Law, and in addition thereto, Borrower agrees that at any time a an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Agent and each Lender may (with or without notice to any Person) apply to the payment of any Obligations then due and owing, any and all balances, credits, deposits, accounts or moneys or other properties of Borrower then or thereafter with Agent, any Lender or any of their respective Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Lender shall exercise, or permit any of its Affiliates to exercise, any rights described in the preceding sentence without the prior written consent of Agent. 
 Section 2.10.	 Making of Payments . All payments made by Borrower under any Loan Document to Agent or any Lender shall be paid directly by Borrower to Agent (as opposed to any individual Lender) without setoff, recoupment or counterclaim and in immediately available funds by wire transfer to Agent s account specified in writing from time to time by Agent to Borrower not later than 12:00 noon New York time on the date due, and funds received after that hour may, in Agent s discretion, be deemed to have been received by Agent on the following Business Day. 
 Section 2.11.	 Proration of Payments . If any Lender shall obtain any payment or other recovery (whether voluntary, involuntary, by application of set-off or otherwise) on account of principal of 
 - 24 - 

or interest on a Loan (but excluding (i) any payment pursuant to Section 2.06 or Section 2.07 and (ii) participations and assignments pursuant to Sections 8.01 and 8.02) in excess of its applicable Pro Rata Share of payments and other recoveries obtained by all Lenders on account of principal of and interest on (or with respect to any other applicable amount with respect to) any of the Loans then held by them, then such Lender shall purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the applicable Loans held by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment or other recovery ratably with each of them; provided , that if all or any portion of the excess payment or other recovery is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, the purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery. 
 Section 2.12.	 Recordkeeping . Agent, on behalf of each Lender, shall record in the Register pursuant to Section 8.02 the date and amount of each Loan made by each Lender and each repayment thereof. The aggregate unpaid principal amount so recorded shall govern absent manifest or demonstrable error. The failure to record any such amount or any error in so recording any such amount shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the Obligations of Borrower hereunder or under any Note to repay the principal amount of the Loans hereunder, together with all interest accruing thereon.

 - 36 -

Any attempted assignment not made in accordance with this Section 8.02 shall be null and void.

The entries in such Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and Borrower, Agent and Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded therein pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary, and no assignment shall be effective for any purpose under the Loan Documents unless and until recorded in the Register.

deemed to include (i) the actual and prospective Assignee Lenders and Participants referred to in clause (f) above and the lenders and other funding sources referred to in clause (g) above, as applicable for purposes of this Section 9.14) and (h) solely with respect to Confidential Information consisting of the terms of Loan Documents (including copies thereof), to any creditor of Borrower that is subject to a subordination or intercreditor agreement or provision with Agent, provided further, that in no event shall Agent or any Lender be obligated or required to return any materials furnished by or on behalf of Borrower. The obligations of Agent and each Lender under this Section 9.14 shall supersede and replace the obligations of Agent and each Lender under any confidentiality letter or provision in respect of this financing or any other financing previously signed and delivered by Agent and/or any Lender to Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, on or after the Closing Date, Agent may, at its own expense issue news releases and publish tombstone advertisements and other announcements relating to this transaction in newspapers, trade journals and other appropriate media (which may include use of logos of the Borrower) (collectively, Trade Announcements ), provided that such publications and information shall not include any specifics of the financing transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any information about this Agreement that is not publicly available, and are subject to the prior review and approval of Borrower in its sole discretion. No Lender (other than Comvest and its Affiliates) shall (a) issue any Trade Announcement, (b) use or reference in advertising, publicity, or otherwise the name of Comvest, any Lender or any of their respective Affiliates, partners, or employees, or (c) represent that any product or any service provided has been approved or endorsed by Comvest, any Lender, or any of their respective Affiliates, except (i) disclosures required by Applicable Law, regulation, legal process or the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission or (ii) with the prior approval of Agent. 
 Section 9.15.	 Marshaling . Neither Agent nor any Lender shall be under any obligation to marshal any assets in payment of any or all of the Obligations. 
 Section 9.16.	 No Strict Construction . The parties hereto and to the other Loan Documents have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties hereto and thereto and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document. 
 Section 9.17.	 USA PATRIOT Act Notification . Agent and each Lender hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act, Agent and each Lender may be required to obtain, verify and record certain information and documentation that identifies the Borrower, which information may include the name and address of Borrower and such other information that will allow Agent or such Lender to identify such Person in accordance with the USA PATRIOT Act. 
 Section 9.18.	 Counterparts; Fax/Email Signatures . This Agreement and the other Loan Documents (except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in any such other Loan Documents) may be signed in any number of counterparts and may be executed by facsimile, email delivery or electronic signature, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures hereto and thereto were upon the same instrument. Signatures by facsimile, email delivery or electronic signature or other electronic communication to this Agreement or any such other Loan Document shall bind the parties to the same extent as would a manually executed counterpart. 
 X. AGENT. 
 Section 10.01.	 Appointment; Authorization . Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints, designates and authorizes Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly 
 - 45 - 

delegated to it by the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including, without limitation, enforcement or collection of the Loans), Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required (subject to Section 10.04) to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for in this Agreement or in the other Loan Documents), and such instructions of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents) shall be binding upon all Lenders and all makers of Loans. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against Agent. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, express or implied, is intended to or shall be construed to impose upon Agent any obligations in respect of this Agreement or any other Loan Document except as expressly set forth herein or therein. 
 Section 10.02.	 Delegation of Duties . 
 (a)	Agent may, upon any terms and conditions Agent specifies, delegate or exercise any of its rights, powers and remedies under, and delegate or perform any of its duties or any other actions with respect to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through any trustee, co-agent, sub-agent, other agent, employee, attorney-in-fact or any other Person selected by Agent (and Agent may assign all or any portion of the fees or other amounts payable to Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to any such trustee, co-agent, sub-agent, agent, other agent, employee, attorney-in fact or other Person) and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties and other items. Each such trustee, co-agent, sub-agent, other agent, employee, attorney-in fact or other Person shall benefit from this Section 10 to the extent provided by Agent. Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence, misconduct or any other action or omission of any such trustee, co-agent, sub-agent, other agent, employee, attorney-in fact or other Person (except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final, non-appealable judgement, resulted solely from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of Agent in Agent s selection of such trustee, co-agent, sub-agent, other agent, employee, attorney-in fact or other Person). 
 (b)	Without limiting the generality of the powers of Agent, as set forth above, Agent is hereby authorized to act as collateral agent for each Lender pursuant to each of the Loan Documents. In such capacity, Agent has the right (but not the obligation) to exercise all rights and remedies available under the Loan Documents, the UCC and other Applicable Law, which rights and remedies shall include, in the event of a foreclosure by Agent on any portion of the Collateral, whether pursuant to a public or private sale, the right of Agent, as agent for all Lenders, to be, or form an acquisition entity to be, the purchaser of any or all of such Collateral at any such sale in each case to the extent permitted by and in accordance with Applicable Law. Agent, as agent for all Lenders, shall be entitled (but shall not obligated to) at any such sale to offset any of the Obligations against the purchase price payable by Agent (or such acquisition entity) at such sale or to otherwise consent to a reduction of the Obligations as consideration to the Borrower in connection with such sale. Agent shall have the authority to (but shall not be obligated to) take such other actions as it may deem necessary or desirable, to consummate a sale of the type described in the immediately preceding sentences. Agent shall have the authority to (but shall not be obligated to) accept non-cash consideration in connection with the sale or other disposition of the Collateral, whether the purchaser is Agent, an entity formed by Agent as described above or any other Person. Without limiting the generality of the powers of Agent, as set forth above, in the context of any bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding involving Borrower, Agent is hereby authorized on behalf of any or all of the Lenders to (but shall not be 
 - 46 - 

obligated to): (i) file proofs of claim and other documents, (ii) object or consent to the use of cash collateral, (iii) object or consent to any proposed debtor-in-possession financing, whether provided by one or more of the Lenders or any other Person and whether secured by Liens with priority over the Liens securing the Obligations or otherwise, (iv) object or consent to any sale of Collateral, including sales for non-cash consideration in satisfaction of a portion of the Obligations on behalf of all Lenders, (v) to be, or form an acquisition entity to be, the purchaser of any or all of such Collateral at any such sale under clause (iv) and to offset any of the Obligations against the purchase price payable by Agent (or such acquisition entity) at such sale or to otherwise consent to a reduction of the Obligations as consideration to Borrower in connection with such sale, and (vi) seek, object or consent to Borrower s provision of adequate protection of the interests of Agent and/or the Lenders in the Collateral. 
 Section 10.03.	 Limited Liability . None of Agent or any of its Related Parties shall (a) be liable to any Lender for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions contemplated hereby (except to the extent resulting solely from willful misconduct or gross negligence of such Person as determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction), or (b) be responsible in any manner to any Lender for any recital, statement, representation or warranty made by Borrower or Affiliate of Borrower or any officer thereof, contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document (or the creation, perfection or priority of any Lien or security interest therein), or for any failure of Borrower or any other party to any Loan Document to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of Borrower or Affiliate of Borrower. The provisions of this Section 10.03 shall survive repayment of the Loans, cancellation of the Notes, any foreclosure under, or modification, release or discharge of, the Collateral Agreement or any or all of the Loan Documents, termination of this Agreement and the resignation or replacement of Agent. 
 Section 10.04.	 Reliance . Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex, electronic mail or telephone message, statement or other document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by Agent. Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document (a) unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of Required Lenders (or all Lenders, or such other Lenders, if expressly required hereunder) as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, confirmation from Lenders of their obligation to indemnify Agent against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action, (b) if such action would, in the opinion of Agent, be contrary to Applicable Law or the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (c) if such action would, in the opinion of Agent, expose Agent to liabilities, or (d) if Agent shall not first be indemnified to its satisfaction against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or consent of Required Lenders (or all Lenders, or such other Lenders, if expressly required hereunder) and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon each Lender. Without limiting the foregoing, no Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against Agent as a result of Agent s acting or refraining from acting hereunder or under any other Loan Document in accordance with the instructions of Required Lenders (or all Lenders, or such other Lenders, if expressly required hereunder). 
 - 47 - 

Section 10.05.	 Notice of Default; Dissemination of Information . Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Event of Default or Default, unless Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Event of Default or Default and expressly stating that such notice is a notice of default or words of like import. Agent will endeavor to notify the Lenders of its receipt of any such notice; provided that Agent shall not have any liability whatsoever for failing to deliver any such notice. Agent shall take such action with respect to such Event of Default or Default as may be reasonably requested by Required Lenders in accordance with Section 7.02; provided that unless and until Agent has received any such request, Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Event of Default or Default as it shall deem advisable in its sole discretion. Agent and Lenders acknowledge that Borrower is required to provide certain financial statements and other financial information and reports to Agent and/or Lenders in accordance with the Loan Documents and agree that Agent shall not have any duty to provide the same to Lenders. 
 Section 10.06.	 Credit Decision . Each Lender acknowledges that Agent has not made any representation or warranty to it, and that no act by Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of Borrower, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon Agent and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of Borrower, and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to Borrower hereunder. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon Agent and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly herein required to be furnished to the Lenders by Agent, Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial or other condition or creditworthiness of Borrower which may come into the possession of Agent. 
 Section 10.07.	 Indemnification . Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, each Lender shall indemnify (based on such Lender s Pro Rata Share) Agent and its Related Parties against (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of Borrower and without limiting the obligation of Borrower to do so), and shall hold Agent and its Related Parties harmless from, any and all losses, claims, taxes (other than an Excluded Tax) damages and liabilities and related reasonable expenses (provided such reasonable qualifier shall not apply with respect to costs and expenses of Agent incurred during the existence of an Event of Default), including counsel fees and expenses, incurred by Agent or any of its Related Parties arising out of, in any way connected with, or as a result of: (a) the use of any of the proceeds of the Loans; (b) this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (c) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (d) the ownership and operation of Borrower s assets, including all Real Properties and improvements or any Contract or the performance by Borrower of its obligations under any Contract; (e) any finder s fee, brokerage commission of other such obligation payable or alleged to be payable in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document which arises or is alleged to arise from any agreement, action or conduct of Borrower or any of its Affiliates, and/or (f) any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether or not Agent, or any of its Related Parties are a party thereto; provided that such indemnity provided to any such Person shall not apply to any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses to the extent arising solely from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of such Person as determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. All amounts due under this Section 10.07 shall be payable on written demand therefor. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse 
 - 48 - 

Agent upon demand for its Pro Rata Share of any costs or out of pocket expenses (including legal costs and expenses) incurred by Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of Borrower. The undertaking in this Section 10.07 shall survive repayment of the Loans, cancellation of the Notes, any foreclosure under, or modification, release or discharge of, the Security Agreement or any or all of the Loan Documents, termination of this Agreement and the resignation or replacement of Agent. 
 Section 10.08.	 Agent Individually . Comvest and its Affiliates and Related Funds may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other business with Borrower, any other Person and any Affiliate of Borrower or any other Person as though Comvest were not Agent hereunder and without notice to or consent of any Lender. Each Lender acknowledges that, pursuant to such activities, Comvest or its Affiliates or its Related Funds may receive information regarding the Borrower, other Persons or their Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of Borrower, such other Person or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such information to them. With respect to their Loans (if any), Comvest and its Affiliates and Related Funds shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though Comvest were not Agent, and the terms Lender and Lenders include Comvest and its Affiliates and Related Funds, to the extent applicable, in their individual capacities. 
 Section 10.09.	 Successor Agent . Agent may (and, at the direction of Required Lenders, shall) resign as Agent at any time upon 30 days prior notice to the Lenders and Borrower (unless such notice is waived by Required Lenders and Borrower). If Agent resigns under this Agreement, Required Lenders shall, appoint from among the Lenders a successor Agent for the Lenders and reasonably acceptable to Borrower. If no successor Agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of Agent, Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Lenders and Borrower, a successor Agent . Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor Agent hereunder, such successor Agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Agent and the term Agent shall mean such successor Agent , and the retiring Agent s appointment, powers and duties as Agent shall be terminated. After any retiring Agent s resignation hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Article X and Section 9.02 shall continue to inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement. If no successor Agent has accepted appointment as Agent by the date which is 30 days following a retiring Agent s notice of resignation, the retiring Agent s resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as Required Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided for above. 
 Section 10.10.	 Collateral Matters . The Lenders consent and irrevocably authorize Agent, at its option and in its discretion, (a) to release any Lien granted to or held by Agent under the Security Agreement and/or any other collateral document (i) when all outstanding monetary Obligations owing with respect to the Loans have been paid in full and the Commitments have been terminated (it being understood and agreed to that Agent shall be under no obligation to account for any outstanding monetary Obligations owing to any Lender that have not been reported to Agent in writing by such Lender and Agent may assume that no such non-reported monetary Obligations owing to such Lender exist for purposes of this clause (i)); (ii) constituting property sold or to be sold or disposed of as part of or in connection with any sale or other disposition permitted under this Agreement (including by consent, waiver or amendment and it being agreed and understood that Agent may conclusively rely without further inquiry on a certificate of an officer of Borrower as to the sale or other disposition of property being made in compliance with this Agreement); or 
 - 49 - 

(iii) subject to Section 11.01, if approved, authorized or ratified in writing by Required Lenders; or (b) to subordinate its interest in any Collateral to any holder of a purchase money (or its equivalent) Lien on such Collateral which is permitted by hereunder (it being understood that Agent may conclusively rely on a certificate from Borrower in determining whether the Indebtedness secured by any such Lien is permitted hereunder). Upon request by Agent at any time, the Lenders will confirm in writing Agent s authority to release, or subordinate its interest in, particular types or items of Collateral pursuant to this Section 10.10. 
 Section 10.11.	 [Reserved] . 
 Section 10.12.	 Subordination Agreements . Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints, designates and authorizes Agent to enter into any subordination or intercreditor agreement, if any, pertaining to any other Indebtedness permitted to be incurred by Borrower hereunder, on its behalf and to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of any such agreement, including, without limitation, the Subordination Agreement. Each Lender further agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of any subordination or intercreditor agreement pertaining to any other such Indebtedness, including, without limitation, the Subordination Agreement, and each Lender hereby authorizes Agent to issue blockages notices in connection with any such Indebtedness. 
 Section 10.13.	 Actions in Concert . Each Lender hereby agrees with each other Lender that no Lender shall take any action to protect or enforce its rights arising out of this Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan Document (including exercising any rights of setoff) without first obtaining the prior written consent of Agent, it being the intent of the Lenders that any such action to protect or enforce rights under this Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents shall be taken in concert and at the direction or with the consent of Agent. 
 Section 10.14.	 No Fiduciary Relationship . It is understood and agreed that the use of the term agent herein or in any other Loan Document (or any other similar term) with reference to Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties. 
 XI. WAIVER; AMENDMENTS. 
 Section 11.01.	 General Terms . No amendment, modification or waiver of, or consent with respect to, any provision of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by (i) Borrower (with respect to Loan Documents to which Borrower is a party), (ii) Agent, and (iv) the Lenders having aggregate Pro Rata Shares of not less than the aggregate Pro Rata Shares expressly designated herein with respect thereto or, in the absence of such express designation herein, by Required Lenders (or by Agent at the direction of such Lenders or Required Lenders), and then any such amendment, modification, waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that:

 - 50 - 

payable hereunder or under the other Loan Documents or (4) amend the provisions of Section 2.05 or the pro rata sharing provisions thereof; and

 Section 11.02.	 Agency Provisions . No amendment, modification, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by Agent, as applicable, in addition to the Borrower and Required Lenders (or all the Lenders directly affected thereby or all of the Lenders, as the case may be in accordance with the provisions above), affect the rights, privileges, duties or obligations of Agent (including without limitation under the provisions of Article X) under this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

 Section 11.04.	 [Reserved] .

Upon notice thereof by Agent to Borrower, any obligation of the Lenders to make a Loan shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Loans or affected Interest Periods) until Agent (with respect to clause (ii), at the instruction of Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of Loans (to the extent of the affected Loans or affected Interest Periods). 
 (b)	Benchmark Replacement Setting. 
 (i)	 Benchmark Replacement Setting . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (a) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (b) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any 
 - 51 - 

amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising Required Lenders. If the Benchmark Replacement is Daily Simple SOFR, all interest payments will be payable on a monthly basis. 
 (ii)	 Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes . In connection with the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document.. 
 (iii)	 Notices; Standards For Decisions and Determinations . Agent will promptly notify Borrower and the Lenders of (A) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement and (B) the effectiveness of any Conforming Changes in connection with the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement. Agent will notify Borrower of (x) the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to Section 11.05(b)(iv) and (y) the commencement of any Benchmark Unavailability Period.

Section 4.5 Reorganization . In any action or proceeding involving any state corporate limited partnership or limited liability company law, or any applicable state, federal or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the rights of creditors generally, if the obligations of any Obligor under Article IV would otherwise be held or determined to be void, voidable, invalid or unenforceable, or subordinated to the claims of any other creditors, on account of the amount of its liability under Article IV, then, notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any further action by such Obligor or any other Person, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount (after giving effect to the liability under this Guaranty, but before giving effect to any other

This Guaranty shall remain in full force and effect and be binding in accordance with and to the extent of its terms upon the Obligors and the successors and assigns thereof, and shall inure to the benefit of Lender and its successors and assigns, notwithstanding that from time to time during the term of this Note there may be no Guaranteed Obligations outstanding. 
 (c) The obligations of the Obligors under this Section 13 shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by or on behalf of the Company or other Obligor in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether as a result of any 

6 

proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise. Each Obligor hereby agrees that until the payment in full in cash and satisfaction in full of all Guaranteed Obligations it shall subordinate any claim and shall not exercise any right or remedy, direct or indirect, arising by reason of any performance by it of its guarantee in Section 13 , whether by subrogation, contribution or otherwise, against the Company or any other Obligor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations. 

(d) The Obligors jointly and severally agree that, as between the Obligors and the Lender, the obligations of the Company under this Note may be declared to be forthwith due and payable (or become automatically due and payable) as provided therein for purposes of Section 13 , notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such declaration (or such obligations from becoming automatically due and payable) as against the Company and that, in the event of such declaration (or such obligations being deemed to have become automatically due and payable), such obligations (whether or not due and payable by the Borrower) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Obligors for purposes of Section 13 . 

(e) In any action or proceeding involving any state corporate limited partnership or limited liability company law, or any applicable state, federal or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the rights of creditors generally, if the obligations of any Obligor under Section 13 would otherwise be held or determined to be void, voidable, invalid or unenforceable, or subordinated to the claims of any other creditors, on account of the amount of its liability under Section 13 , then, notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any further action by such Obligor or any other Person, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount (after giving effect to the liability under this Guaranty, but before giving effect to any other guarantee) that is valid and enforceable and not subordinated to the claims of other creditors as determined in such action or proceeding. 

14. Ranking . This Note is subject to the Subordination Agreement, and in case of any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of the Subordination Agreement, the terms of the Subordination Agreement shall control.

In the event this Note (or any portion thereof) is transferred to any person who is not subject to New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual Section 312.03 (the Transferee ), at the election of such person from time to time, on one or more occasions, then the outstanding principal amount of such Note (or any portion thereof), together with all accrued but unpaid interest thereon, shall convert into a number of Common Shares, using a conversion price per Common Share equal to the Minimum Price. If the conversion of this Note 

7 

(or such portion thereof) would result in the issuance of a fractional Common Share, the Company shall, in lieu of issuance of any fractional unit, pay Lender or Transferee a sum in cash equal to the product resulting from multiplying the then current fair market value of one Common Share by such fraction. In connection with exercising its election to convert this Note, Lender or Transferee shall surrender this Note to the Company (in the case of an exercise in respect of less than all of the outstanding amount of this Note, such surrender shall be made upon receipt of a new Note reflecting the reduced remaining amount, and otherwise having the same terms and conditions as this Note), and deliver to the Company and documentation reasonably required by the Company in order to complete its obligations to deliver Common Shares hereunder.

An Additional Guarantor that subsequently becomes an Excluded Subsidiary shall not thereby be released from its obligations hereunder.

Borrower: 
 Surf Air Mobility Inc., a Delaware corporation 

Address: 
 12111 S. Crenshaw Boulevard, Hawthorne, CA 90250 

Date: 
 June 21, 2023 

This CONVERTIBLE NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this Agreement is entered into as of the date specified above between PARTNERS FOR GROWTH V, L.P. PFG ), whose address is 1751 Tiburon Blvd., Tiburon, CA 94920, and the Borrower named above Borrower or Company ), whose principal office is located at the above address Borrower s Address ). The Schedule to this Agreement (the Schedule being signed by the parties concurrently, is an integral part of this Agreement. (Definitions of certain terms used in this Agreement are set forth in Section 7 below.) 
 1. PFG INVESTMENT . 

1.1 Investments . PFG agrees to make the PFG Investment in Borrower in the amount shown in the Schedule in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 

1.2 Interest . The PFG Investment and all other monetary Obligations shall bear interest at the rate(s) shown in the Schedule, except where otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement. Interest on the PFG Investment shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date. Interest payable from time to time on the principal amount of the PFG Investment will be determined by multiplying outstanding principal amount of the PFG Investment by the per annum interest rate set forth in Section 2 of the Schedule and dividing such product by 360 to render a daily interest amount, which daily interest amount will be multiplied by the actual number of days elapsed in each month (or other Billing Period) to derive the amount of interest due in such month (or other Billing Period). In computing interest, (i) all payments received after 12:00 p.m. U.S. Pacific time on any day shall be deemed received at the opening of business on the next Business Day, and (ii) the date of the making of the PFG Investment shall be included and the date of payment shall be excluded; provided, however, that if the PFG Investment is repaid on the same day on which it is made, such day shall be included in computing interest on such PFG Investment. If any payment is due on a calendar day that is not a Business Day, then such payment will be due on the next Business Day. 

1.3 Fees . Borrower shall pay PFG the fees shown in the Schedule, which are in addition to all interest, PFG Expenses and other sums payable to PFG, all of which are not refundable. 

1.4 Late Fee . If any payment of principal or interest Obligation is not received by PFG by the end of the third Business Day after the later of (i) the date for such payment to be received by PFG as reflected in any PFG invoice that may be sent from time to time to Borrower and (ii) such Obligation s Due Date, then upon each such failure to timely pay Borrower shall pay PFG a late payment fee equal to 5 of the amount of the payment due and not timely paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, Borrower shall not incur the afore-specified late payment fee in respect of an Obligation contemplated within clause (ii) of the definition of Due Date that is capable of being reasonably estimated (such as the interest portion of a monthly payment where an intervening principal payment has also been made) so long as Borrower pays the greater of the amount reasonably estimated and the last such monthly payment made. If Borrower has overpaid the amount due based on its reasonable estimation, PFG will credit any such overpayment to the next payment due. If Borrower has underpaid based on its reasonable estimation, then so long as Borrower pays the amount of such underpayment within three Business Days of PFG s notice of such underpayment, no late payment fee shall apply to such underpayment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the imposition of any late payment fee and Borrower s payment thereof shall not be construed as PFG s consent to Borrower s failure to pay any amounts when due, and PFG s acceptance of any late payment shall not 

1 

restrict PFG s exercise of any remedies arising out of any such failure, such as under Section 6 of this Agreement. Unless expressly waived in writing by PFG in its sole discretion, interest at the Default Rate shall commence to apply to all monetary Obligations not timely paid as from the Due Date. 

1.5 Invoicing . PFG will send invoices to Borrower (i) prior to the end of each month reflecting amounts due from time to time under or in connection with this Agreement, including for interest that will fall due through the end of each such month and (as applicable) recurring or scheduled principal payments, and (ii) from time to time not less than three Business Days before the Due Date for other non-recurring monetary Obligations and monetary Obligations not having a specified date for payment. To the extent the applicable invoice is provided in accordance with this Section 1.5 , the responsibility to make payments so that they are received by PFG on or prior to the Due Date rests solely with Borrower.
