 , as compared to as of June 30, 2024. Included in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 was (1) in advance cash proceeds primarily from ticket sales, a majority of which the Company expects to pay to artists and promoters, and (2) of cash and cash equivalents at MSG Networks, which are not available for distribution to the Company in order to maintain compliance with the covenants under the MSG Networks Credit Facilities (as defined below) (which, for the avoidance of doubt, remain available to be used in connection with the refinancing of such facilities as discussed below). In addition, as of September 30, 2024, the Company had of accounts payable, accrued and other current liabilities, including of capital expenditure accruals primarily related to Sphere construction (a significant portion of which is in dispute and which the Company does not expect to pay). 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from the operations of our businesses. The Company s uses of cash over the next 12 months beyond the issuance date and thereafter are expected to be substantial and include working capital-related items (including funding our operations), capital spending (including the creation of additional original content for Sphere), required debt service payments, payments we expect MSG Networks to make in connection with the work-out of its indebtedness, and investments and related loans and advances that we may fund from time to time. We may also use cash to repurchase our common stock. Our decisions as to the use of our available liquidity will be based upon the ongoing review of the funding needs of our businesses, the optimal allocation of cash resources, and the timing of cash flow generation. To the extent that we desire to access alternative sources of funding through the capital and credit markets, market conditions could adversely impact our ability to do so at that time. 
 Our ability to have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations and refinance our indebtedness is dependent on the ability of Sphere to generate significant positive cash flow. Although Sphere has been embraced by guests, artists, promoters, advertisers and marketing partners, and we anticipate that Sphere will generate substantial revenue and adjusted operating income on an annual basis over time, there can be no assurance that guests, artists, promoters, advertisers and marketing partners will continue to embrace this new platform. Original immersive productions, such as Postcard From Earth and V-U2 An Immersive Concert Film , have not been previously pursued on the scale of Sphere, which increases the uncertainty of our operating expectations. To the extent that our efforts do not result in viable shows, or to the extent that any such productions do not achieve expected levels of popularity among audiences, we may not generate the cash flows from operations necessary to fund our operations. To the extent we do not realize expected cash flows from operations from Sphere, we would have to take several actions to improve our financial flexibility and preserve liquidity, including significant reductions in both labor and non-labor expenses as well as reductions and/or deferrals in capital spending. Therefore, while we currently believe we will have sufficient liquidity from cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations (including expected cash flows from operations from Sphere) to fund our operations, no assurance can be provided that our liquidity will be sufficient in the event any of the preceding uncertainties facing Sphere are realized over the next 12 months beyond the issuance date. 
 The principal balance of the Company s total debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024 was , including of debt under the MSG Networks Credit Facilities (as defined under Note 10. Credit Facilities and Convertible Notes) which is classified as short-term on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Prior to maturity of the MSG Networks Credit Facilities, in September 2024, MSG Networks made a required quarterly amortization payment. The remaining outstanding borrowings under the MSG Networks Credit Facilities of matured on October 11, 2024 (the Maturity Date and an event of default occurred under the MSGN Credit Agreement due to MSGN L.P. s failure to make payment on the outstanding principal amount. On October 11, 2024, MSGN L.P. and the MSGN Guarantors (as defined under Note 10. Credit Facilities and Convertible Notes) entered into a Forbearance Agreement (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the Forbearance Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain lenders (the Supporting Lenders under the MSGN Credit Agreement. Subject to the terms of the Forbearance Agreement, the Supporting Lenders agreed to forbear, during the Forbearance Period (as defined below), from exercising certain of their available remedies under the MSGN Credit Agreement with respect to or arising out of MSGN L.P. s failure to make payment on the outstanding principal amount under the MSGN Term Loan Facility on the Maturity Date. The forbearance period (the Forbearance Period under the Forbearance Agreement was initially scheduled to expire on November 8, 2024 and has been extended to expire on the earlier to occur of (a) November 26, 2024, or such later date agreed to by MSGN L.P. and the Supporting Lenders that hold a majority in principal amount of term loans held by all Supporting Lenders under the MSGN Term Loan Facility and (b) the date on which any Termination Event (as defined in the Forbearance Agreement) occurs. See Note 10. Credit Facilities and Convertible Notes. MSG Networks will be unable to settle the remaining outstanding borrowings under the MSG Networks Credit Facilities prior to the expiration of the Forbearance Period absent action taken by management to refinance the outstanding borrowings. 
 As of the issuance date, MSG Networks continues to pursue a work-out of the MSG Networks Credit Facilities with its syndicate of lenders. The Company has been advised that a cash equity contribution from Sphere Entertainment Group, LLC Sphere Entertainment Group to MSG Networks will be required in connection with a work-out. If a contribution is made, it is not expected to adversely impact Sphere Entertainment Co. s ability to fund its operations.

Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

MSG Networks serves the New York designated market area, as well as other portions of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania and features a wide range of sports content, including exclusive live local games and other programming of the New York Knicks (the Knicks of the NBA and the New York Rangers (the Rangers ), New York Islanders, New Jersey Devils and Buffalo Sabres of the NHL, as well as significant coverage of the New York Giants and the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League. 
 Our MD A is organized as follows:

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Critical Accounting Estimates and in the notes to the Audited Consolidated Annual Financial Statements included therein. 
 Factors Affecting Operating Results 
 The operating results of our Sphere segment are largely dependent on our ability to continue to attract (i) audiences to The Sphere Experience, (ii) advertisers and marketing partners, and (iii) guests to attend, and artists to perform at, residencies, concerts and other events at our venue. The operating results of our MSG Networks segment are largely dependent on (i) the affiliation agreements MSG Networks negotiates with Distributors, (ii) the number of subscribers of certain Distributors, (iii) the success of MSG+, MSG Networks DTC and authenticated streaming product, and (iv) the advertising rates we charge advertisers. Certain of these factors in turn depend on the popularity and/or performance of the professional sports teams whose games we broadcast on our networks. 
 Our Company s future performance is dependent in part on general economic conditions and the effect of these conditions on our customers. Weak economic conditions may lead to lower demand for our entertainment offerings (including The Sphere Experience) and programming content, which would also negatively affect concession and merchandise sales, and could lead to lower levels of advertising, sponsorship and venue signage. These conditions may also affect the number of immersive productions, concerts, residencies and other events that take place in the future. An economic downturn could adversely affect our business and results of operations. The Company continues to explore additional opportunities to expand our presence in the entertainment industry. Any new investment may not initially contribute to operating income, but is intended to contribute to the success of the Company over time. Our results will also be affected by investments in, and the success of, new original immersive productions.

 Depreciation and amortization 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, depreciation and amortization increased 67,654, as compared to the prior year period primarily due to an increase in depreciation of assets related to Sphere in Las Vegas that were placed in service at the end of the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2024. 
 Impairment and other (losses) gains, net 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized impairment and other losses, net of 4,033, as compared to other gains, net of 1,497, in the prior year period.

Interest income 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest income increased 2,661, as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to higher average cash and cash equivalent balances. 
 Interest expense 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense increased 26,974 as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to (i) the Company discontinuing the capitalization of interest expense during the second quarter of Fiscal Year 2024 as assets were placed in service following the opening of Sphere in Las Vegas and (ii) interest expense on the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes due 2028 (the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes ), which were issued in December 2023.

 Income tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2023 of 90,287, reflects an effective tax rate of 389 . The effective tax rate exceeds the statutory federal tax rate of 21 primarily due to discrete items including 64,401 of income tax benefit related to the state rate change used to measure the deferred taxes, and income tax benefit of 15,655 related to the nontaxable gain on the repayment of all amounts outstanding under the delayed draw term loan facility with MSG Entertainment (the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility ).

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in direct operating expenses from sponsorship, signage, Exosphere advertising and suite license fees primarily reflects higher expenses related to advertising campaigns on the venue s Exosphere, primarily due to a full quarter of campaigns in the current year period as compared to a partial quarter in the prior year period as a result of the start of Exosphere campaigns in September 2023.

 Adjusted operating loss 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, adjusted operating income improved 56,768 as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to an increase in revenues, partially offset by an increase in direct operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding share-based compensation expense and merger, debt work-out, and acquisition related costs, net of insurance recoveries).

Revenues 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenues decreased 9,387 as compared to the prior year period. The changes in revenues were attributable to the following: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Decrease in distribution revenue (9,307) Decrease in advertising revenue (108) Other net increases 28 (9,387) In June 2023, MSG Networks introduced MSG+, a DTC and authenticated streaming product, which allows subscribers to access MSG Network and MSG Sportsnet as well as on demand content across various devices. As of October 2024, MSG+ is included in the Gotham Sports streaming product launched as part of MSG Networks joint venture with YES Network. MSG+ is available on a free, authenticated basis to subscribers of participating Distributors (including all of MSG Networks major Distributors), as well as for purchase by viewers on a DTC basis through monthly and annual subscriptions, as well as single game purchases. As a result, (i) distribution revenue as presented above includes both affiliation fee revenue earned from Distributors for the right to carry the Company s networks as well as revenue earned from subscriptions and single game purchases on MSG+; (ii) advertising revenue as presented above includes the impact of MSG+ advertising revenue; and (iii) total subscribers as discussed below includes both subscribers of Distributors as well as monthly and annual subscribers of MSG+. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, distribution revenue decreased 9,307, primarily due to a decrease in total subscribers of approximately 13.0 , partially offset by the impact of higher affiliation rates in the current year quarter. 
 Direct operating expenses 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 direct operating expenses increased by 553 as compared to the prior year period. The changes in direct operating expenses were attributable to the following: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Increase in rights fees expense 1,301 Decrease in other programming and production content costs (748) 553 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, rights fees expense increased 1,301 primarily due to the impact of annual contractual rate increases, partially offset by the net impact of reductions resulting from fewer NBA and NHL games made available to MSG Networks for exclusive broadcast. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, other programming and production content costs decreased 748, including lower costs associated with MSG+. 
 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, selling, general and administrative expenses of 14,027 increased 11,033 as compared to the prior year period , primarily due to higher professional fees of 10,441, mainly reflecting the absence of litigation-related insurance recoveries associated with the Networks Merger recorded in the prior year period and costs associated with pursuing a work-out of the MSG Networks Credit Facilities with its syndicate of lenders recorded in the current year period. 
 
 Operating income 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, operating income decreased 21,196 as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses and the decrease in revenues. 
 38 

Adjusted operating income 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, adjusted operating income decreased 9,081 as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the decrease in revenues, partially offset by the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding merger, debt work-out, and acquisition related costs, net of insurance recoveries, and share-based compensation expense). 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources and Uses of Liquidity 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company s unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balance was 539,630, as compared to 559,757 as of June 30, 2024. Included in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 was (1) 158,022 in advance cash proceeds primarily from ticket sales, a majority of which the Company expects to pay to artists and promoters, and (2) 126,303 of cash and cash equivalents at MSG Networks, which are not available for distribution to the Company in order to maintain compliance with the covenants under the MSG Networks Credit Facilities (as defined below) (which, for the avoidance of doubt, remain available to be used in connection with the refinancing of such facilities as discussed below). In addition, as of September 30, 2024, the Company had 371,877 of accounts payable, accrued and other current liabilities, including 148,578 of capital expenditure accruals primarily related to Sphere construction (a significant portion of which is in dispute and which the Company does not expect to pay). 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from the operations of our businesses. The Company s uses of cash over the next 12 months beyond the issuance date of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I Item 1. of this Form 10-Q (the issuance date and thereafter are expected to be substantial and include working capital-related items (including funding our operations), capital spending (including the creation of additional original content for Sphere), required debt service payments, payments we expect MSG Networks to make in connection with the work-out of its indebtedness, and investments and related loans and advances that we may fund from time to time. We may also use cash to repurchase our common stock. Our decisions as to the use of our available liquidity will be based upon the ongoing review of the funding needs of our businesses, the optimal allocation of cash resources, and the timing of cash flow generation. To the extent that we desire to access alternative sources of funding through the capital and credit markets, market conditions could adversely impact our ability to do so at that time. 
 Our ability to have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations and refinance our indebtedness is dependent on the ability of Sphere to generate significant positive cash flow. Although Sphere has been embraced by guests, artists, promoters, advertisers and marketing partners, and we anticipate that Sphere will generate substantial revenue and adjusted operating income on an annual basis over time, there can be no assurance that guests, artists, promoters, advertisers and marketing partners will continue to embrace this new platform. Original immersive productions, such as Postcard From Earth and V-U2 An Immersive Concert Film , have not been previously pursued on the scale of Sphere, which increases the uncertainty of our operating expectations. To the extent that our efforts do not result in viable shows, or to the extent that any such productions do not achieve expected levels of popularity among audiences, we may not generate the cash flows from operations necessary to fund our operations. To the extent we do not realize expected cash flows from operations from Sphere, we would have to take several actions to improve our financial flexibility and preserve liquidity, including significant reductions in both labor and non-labor expenses as well as reductions and/or deferrals in capital spending. Therefore, while we currently believe we will have sufficient liquidity from cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations (including expected cash flows from operations from Sphere) to fund our operations, no assurance can be provided that our liquidity will be sufficient in the event any of the preceding uncertainties facing Sphere are realized over the next 12 months beyond the issuance date. See Part II Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Indebtedness, Financial Condition, and Internal Control We Have Substantial Indebtedness and Are Highly Leveraged, Which Could Adversely Affect Our Business. 
 The principal balance of the Company s total debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024 was 1,362,875, including 829,125 of debt under the MSG Networks Credit Facilities which is classified as short-term on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Prior to maturity of the MSG Networks Credit Facilities, in September 2024, MSG Networks made a 20,625 required quarterly amortization payment. The remaining outstanding borrowings under the MSG Networks Credit Facilities of 829,125 matured on October 11, 2024 (the Maturity Date and an event of default occurred under the MSGN Credit Agreement due to MSGN L.P. s failure to make payment on the outstanding principal amount. On October 11, 2024, MSGN L.P. and the MSGN Guarantors (as defined below) entered into a Forbearance Agreement (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the Forbearance Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain lenders (the Supporting Lenders under the MSGN Credit Agreement. Subject to the terms of the Forbearance Agreement, the Supporting Lenders agreed to forbear, during the Forbearance Period (as defined below), from exercising certain of their available remedies under the MSGN Credit Agreement with respect to or arising out of MSGN L.P. s failure to make payment on the outstanding principal amount under the MSGN Term Loan Facility on the Maturity Date. The forbearance period (the Forbearance Period under the Forbearance Agreement was initially scheduled to expire on November 8, 2024 and has been extended to expire on the earlier to occur of (a) November 26, 2024, or such later date agreed to by 
 39 

MSGN L.P. and the Supporting Lenders that hold a majority in principal amount of term loans held by all Supporting Lenders under the MSGN Term Loan Facility and (b) the date on which any Termination Event (as defined in the Forbearance Agreement) occurs. See Note 10. Credit Facilities and Convertible Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. MSG Networks will be unable to settle the remaining outstanding borrowings under the MSG Networks Credit Facilities prior to the expiration of the Forbearance Period absent action taken by management to refinance the outstanding borrowings. 
 As of the issuance date, MSG Networks continues to pursue a work-out of the MSG Networks Credit Facilities with its syndicate of lenders. The Company has been advised that a cash equity contribution from Sphere Entertainment Group, LLC Sphere Entertainment Group to MSG Networks will be required in connection with a work-out. If a contribution is made, it is not expected to adversely impact Sphere Entertainment Co. s ability to fund its operations. 
 As disclosed in Note 10. Credit Facilities and Convertible Notes, a ll of the outstanding borrowings under the MSG Networks Credit Facilities are guaranteed by the MSGN Guarantors and secured by the MSGN Collateral (each as defined below) . In the event MSG Networks is unable to successfully refinance the MSG Networks Credit Facilities prior to the end of the Forbearance Period (subject to any extensions thereof), the lenders could exercise their remedies under the MSG Networks Credit Facilities, which would include, but not be limited to, declaring an event of default and foreclosing on the MSGN Collateral. MSG Networks and its subsidiaries could also seek bankruptcy protection prior to the lenders exercising their rights under the MSG Networks Credit Facilities. However, as of the issuance date, MSG Networks and its subsidiaries do not intend to seek such bankruptcy protection. See Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Indebtedness, Financial Condition, and Internal Control An Event of Default Exists Under the MSG Networks Credit Facilities; Although MSG Networks Is Pursuing a Work-out of Its Credit Facilities, There Can Be No Assurances That It Will Be Successful; If MSG Networks Is Unable to Refinance the MSG Networks Credit Facilities, the Outstanding Debt Thereunder Could Be Accelerated and the Lenders Could Foreclose Upon the MSG Networks Business. Sphere Entertainment Co., Sphere Entertainment Group and the subsidiaries of Sphere Entertainment Group (collectively, the Non-Credit Parties are not legally obligated to fund the outstanding borrowings under the MSG Networks Credit Facilities, nor are the assets of the Non-Credit Parties pledged as security under the MSG Networks Credit Facilities. In the event of an exercise of post-default rights and remedies, the Company believes the lenders would have no remedies or recourse against the Non-Credit Parties pursuant to the terms of the MSG Networks Credit Facilities. While this condition raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern , for the reasons stated above, we have concluded this condition has been effectively alleviated as of the issuance date by the lenders right to foreclose only on the MSGN Collateral . 
 See Note 10. Credit Facilities and Convertible Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I Item 1. of this Form 10-Q for a discussion of the MSG Networks Credit Facilities, the LV Sphere Term Loan Facility and the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes.

 On March 31, 2020, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to 350,000 of the Company s Class A Common Stock, par value 0.01 per share Class A Common Stock ). The program was re-authorized by the Company s Board of Directors on March 29, 2023. Under the authorization, shares of Class A Common Stock may be purchased from time to time in open market transactions, in accordance with applicable insider trading and other securities laws and regulations. The timing and amount of purchases will depend on market conditions and other factors. No shares have been repurchased under the share repurchase program to date. 
 Sphere 
 The Company opened Sphere in Las Vegas in September 2023. See Part I Item 1. Our Business Sphere in the 2024 Form 10-K. The venue has a number of revenue streams, including The Sphere Experience (which includes original immersive productions), advertising and marketing partnerships, and concert residencies, corporate and marquee sporting events, each of which the Company expects to become significant over time. As a result, we anticipate that Sphere in Las Vegas will generate substantial revenue and adjusted operating income on an annual basis over time. 
 In October 2024, the Company and DCT Abu Dhabi announced that they will work together to bring the world s second Sphere to Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Under the terms of the partnership, which is subject to finalization of definitive agreements, DCT Abu Dhabi will pay the Company a franchise initiation fee for the right to build the venue, utilizing the Company s proprietary designs, technology, and intellectual property. Construction will be funded by DCT Abu Dhabi, with the Company s team of experts providing services related to development, construction, and pre-opening of the venue. Following the venue s opening, the Company plans to maintain ongoing arrangements with DCT Abu Dhabi that are expected to include annual fees for creative and artistic content licensed by the Company, such as Sphere Experiences; use of Sphere s brand, patents, proprietary technology, and intellectual 
 40 

property; and operational services related to venue operations and technology, as well as commercial and strategic advisory support. 
 We will continue to explore additional domestic and international markets where we believe Sphere venues can be successful. The Company s intention for any future venues is to utilize several options, such as joint ventures, equity partners, a managed venue model and non-recourse debt financing.

 If certain corporate events occur or the Company delivers a notice of redemption prior to the maturity date of the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes, and a holder elects to convert its 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes in connection with such corporate event or notice of redemption, as the case may be, the Company will, under certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes so surrendered for conversion by a number of additional shares of Class A Common Stock in accordance with the Indenture. No adjustment to the conversion rate will be made if the price paid or deemed to be paid per share of Class A Common Stock in such corporate event or redemption, as the case may be, is either less than 28.41 per share or exceeds 280.00 per share. 
 If a specified Fundamental Change (as defined in the Indenture) occurs prior to the maturity date of the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes, under certain circumstances each holder may require the Company to repurchase all or part of its 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the repurchase date. 
 Under the Indenture, the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes may be accelerated upon the occurrence of certain events of default. In the case of an event of default with respect to the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes arising from specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company, 100 of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes will automatically become due and payable. If any other event of default with respect to the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes under the Indenture occurs or is continuing, the Trustee or holders of at least 25 in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes may declare the principal amount of the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes to be immediately due and payable. 
 On December 5, 2023, in connection with the pricing of the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes, and on December 6, 2023, in connection with the exercise in full by the initial purchasers of their option to purchase additional 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes, the Company entered into capped call transactions with certain of the initial purchasers of the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes or their respective affiliates and other financial institutions, pursuant to capped call confirmations. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to the Class A Common Stock upon any conversion of the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes and/or offset 
 43 

any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap based on a cap price initially equal to approximately 42.62 per share (which represents a premium of approximately 50 over the last reported sale price of the Class A Common Stock of 28.41 per share on the New York Stock Exchange on December 5, 2023), and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the capped call transactions. 
 Letters of Credit 
 The Company uses letters of credit to support its business operations. The Company has letters of credit relating to operating leases which are supported by cash and cash equivalents that are classified as restricted. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any material changes in its non-cancelable contractual obligations (other than activities in the ordinary course of business). See Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1. Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q, for further details on the timing and amount of payments under various media rights agreements. 
 
 Cash Flow Discussion 
 As of September 30, 2024, cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled 553,217, as compared to 573,233 as of June 30, 2024. The following table summarizes the Company s cash flow activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 34,094 (94,641) Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities (19,586) 66,498 Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (35,622) 50,854 Effect of exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 1,098 (83) Net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (20,016) 22,628 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash from operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 128,735 as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to an increase in cash flows from changes in working capital of 173,272. The increase in cash flows from changes in working capital were driven by higher collections from customers and fewer payments to vendors and related parties, offset by fewer cash collections related to deferred revenue, as compared to the corresponding prior year period. The increase was further offset by a decrease of net income adjusted for non-cash items of 44,537 in the current year period, as compared to the corresponding prior year period. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash from investing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 86,084 as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the absence of proceeds of 256,501 from the sale of MSGE Retained Interest received in the corresponding prior year period, offset by a decrease in capital expenditures for Sphere in Las Vegas after the assets were placed in service during the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2024. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash from financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 86,476 as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the absence of proceeds of 65,000 from the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility received in the corresponding prior year period, as well as principal repayments of debt of 20,625 in the current year period. 
 
 Seasonality of Our Business 
 Our MSG Networks segment generally earns a higher share of its annual revenues in the second and third quarters of its fiscal year as a result of MSG Networks advertising revenue being largely derived from the sale of inventory in its live NBA and NHL professional sports programming.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 2. Accounting Policies to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1. Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q, for discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 There have been no material changes to the Company s critical accounting policies. The following discussion has been included to provide the results of our annual impairment testing of goodwill performed during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024. 
 Impairment of Goodwill 
 Goodwill is tested annually for impairment as of August 31 st and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances. The Company performs its goodwill impairment test at the reporting unit level. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had two reportable segments and two reporting units, Sphere and MSG Networks, consistent with the way management makes decisions and allocates resources to the business. 
 The goodwill balance reported on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 by reporting unit was as follows: 
 As of September 30, 2024 Sphere 45,644 MSG Networks 424,508 Total Goodwill 470,152 
 The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. If the Company can support the conclusion that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company would not need to perform a quantitative impairment test for that reporting unit. If the Company cannot support such a conclusion or the Company does not elect to perform the qualitative assessment, a quantitative goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. The estimates of the fair value of the Company s reporting units are primarily determined using discounted cash flows, comparable market transactions or other acceptable valuation techniques, including the cost approach. These valuations are based on estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, discount rates, cost-based assumptions, determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables. Significant judgments inherent in a discounted cash flow analysis include the selection of the appropriate discount rate, the estimate of the amount and timing of projected future cash flows and identification of appropriate continuing growth rate assumptions. The discount rates used in the analysis are intended to reflect the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows. The amount of an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which a reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. 
 The Company elected to perform the qualitative assessment of impairment for both of the Company s reporting units during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024. These assessments considered qualitative factors such as: 
 macroeconomic conditions; 
 industry and market considerations; 
 cost factors; 
 overall financial performance of the reporting units; 
 other relevant company-specific factors such as changes in management, strategy or customers; and 
 relevant reporting unit specific events such as changes in the carrying amount of net assets. 
 During the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024, the Company performed its most recent annual impairment tests of goodwill and determined that there were no impairments of goodwill identified for either of its reporting units as of the impairment test date. Based on these impairment tests, the Company s reporting units had sufficient safety margins, representing the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, derived from the most recent quantitative assessments, less its respective carrying value (including goodwill). The Company believes that if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value by greater than 10 , a sufficient safety margin has been realized. The Company continues to closely monitor the performance and fair value of its MSG Networks reporting unit and results of its potential work-out of the MSG Networks Credit Facilities. A significant adverse change in market 
 45 

factors or the business outlook for the MSG Networks reporting unit could negatively impact the fair value of our MSG Networks reporting unit and result in a goodwill impairment at that time. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 There were no material changes to the disclosures regarding market risks in connection with our pension and postretirement plans. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, of the 2024 Form 10-K. 
 Potential Interest Rate Risk Exposure 
 The Company, through its subsidiaries, MSG Networks and MSG LV, is subject to potential interest rate risk exposure related to borrowings incurred under their respective credit facilities. Changes in interest rates may increase interest expense payments with respect to any borrowings incurred under these credit facilities. The effect of a hypothetical 200 basis point increase in floating interest rate prevailing as of September 30, 2024 and continuing for a full year would increase the Company s interest payments on the outstanding amounts under the credit facilities by 22,083. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Exposure 
 We are exposed to market risk resulting from foreign currency fluctuations, primarily to the British pound sterling through our net investment position initiated with our acquisition of land in Stratford, London in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, which we expected would become home to a future Sphere, and through cash and invested funds which we expected would be deployed in the construction of our London venue prior to the Company s decision in November 2023 to no longer pursue the development of a Sphere in the United Kingdom. During the 12 months ended September 30, 2024, the GBP/USD exchange rate ranged from 1.2078 to 1.3417 as compared to GBP/USD exchange rate of 1.3377 on September 30, 2024, a fluctuation range of approximately 5.53 . As of September 30, 2024, a uniform hypothetical 10 fluctuation in the GBP/USD exchange rate would have resulted in a change of approximately 3,600 in the Company s net asset value. 
 Following the acquisition of Holoplot on April 25, 2024, which is based in Berlin, Germany, we are also exposed to market risk resulting from foreign currency fluctuations related to the Euro. During the 12 months ended September 30, 2024, the EUR/USD exchange rate ranged from 1.0130 to 1.1239 as compared to EUR/USD exchange rate of 1.1136 on September 30, 2024, a fluctuation range of approximately 5.43 . As of September 30, 2024, a uniform hypothetical 10 fluctuation in the EUR/USD exchange rate would have resulted in a change of approximately 250 in the Company s net asset value. 
 We may evaluate and decide, to the extent reasonable and practical, to reduce the translation risk of foreign currency fluctuations by entering into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions. If we were to enter into such hedging transactions, the market risk resulting from foreign currency fluctuations is unlikely to be entirely eliminated. We do not plan to enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for foreign currency speculative purposes. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Based on that evaluation, our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Fifteen complaints were filed in connection with the Networks Merger by purported stockholders of the Company and MSG Networks Inc. 
 Nine of these complaints involved allegations of materially incomplete and misleading information set forth in the joint proxy statement/prospectus filed by the Company and MSG Networks Inc. in connection with the Networks Merger. As a result of supplemental disclosures made by the Company and MSG Networks Inc. on July 1, 2021, all of the disclosure actions were voluntarily dismissed with prejudice prior to or shortly following the consummation of the Networks Merger. 
 Six complaints involved allegations of fiduciary breaches in connection with the negotiation and approval of the Networks Merger and were consolidated into two remaining litigations. 
 On September 10, 2021, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the Court entered an order consolidating two derivative complaints filed by purported Company stockholders. The consolidated action is captioned: In re Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp. Stockholders Litigation , C.A. No. 2021-0468-KSJM (the MSG Entertainment Litigation ). The consolidated plaintiffs filed their Verified Consolidated Derivative Complaint on October 11, 2021. The complaint, which named the Company as only a nominal defendant, retained all of the derivative claims and alleged that the members of the board of directors and controlling stockholders violated their fiduciary duties in the course of negotiating and approving the Networks Merger. Plaintiffs sought, among other relief, an award of damages to the Company including interest, and plaintiffs attorneys fees. Pursuant to the indemnity rights in its bylaws and Delaware law, the Company advanced the costs incurred by defendants in this action, and defendants asserted indemnification rights in respect of any adverse judgment or settlement of the action. 
 On March 14, 2023, the parties to the MSG Entertainment Litigation reached an agreement in principle to settle the MSG Entertainment Litigation, without admitting liability, on the terms and conditions set forth in a binding term sheet, which was incorporated into a long-form settlement agreement (the MSGE Settlement Agreement that was filed with the Court on April 20, 2023. The MSGE Settlement Agreement provided for, among other things, the final dismissal of the MSG Entertainment Litigation in exchange for a settlement payment to the Company of approximately 85 million, subject to customary reduction for attorneys fees and expenses, in an amount to be determined by the Court. The settlement s amount was fully funded by the other defendants insurers. The MSGE Settlement Agreement was approved by the Court on August 14, 2023, which constituted the final judgment in the action. 
 On September 27, 2021, the Court entered an order consolidating four complaints filed by purported former stockholders of MSG Networks Inc. The consolidated action is captioned: In re MSG Networks Inc. Stockholder Class Action Litigation, C.A. No. 2021-0575-KSJM (the MSG Networks Litigation ). The consolidated plaintiffs filed their Verified Consolidated Stockholder Class Action Complaint on October 29, 2021. The complaint asserted claims on behalf of a putative class of former MSG Networks Inc. stockholders against each member of the board of directors of MSG Networks Inc. and the controlling stockholders prior to the Networks Merger. Plaintiffs alleged that the MSG Networks Inc. board of directors and controlling stockholders breached their fiduciary duties in negotiating and approving the Networks Merger. The Company was not named as a defendant but was subpoenaed to produce documents and testimony related to the Networks Merger. Plaintiffs sought, among other relief, monetary damages for the putative class and plaintiffs attorneys fees. Pursuant to the indemnity rights in its bylaws and Delaware law, the Company advanced the costs incurred by defendants in this action, and defendants asserted indemnification rights in respect of any adverse judgment or settlement of the action. 
 On April 6, 2023, the parties to the MSG Networks Litigation reached an agreement in principle to settle the MSG Networks Litigation , without admitting liability, on the terms and conditions set forth in a binding term sheet, which was incorporated into a long-form settlement agreement (the MSGN Settlement Agreement that was filed with the Court on May 18, 2023. The MSGN Settlement Agreement provided for, among other things, the final dismissal of the MSG Networks Litigation in exchange for a settlement payment to the plaintiffs and the class of approximately 48.5 million, of which approximately 28 million has been paid by the Company and approximately 20.5 million has been paid to the plaintiffs by insurers (who agreed to advance these costs subject to final resolution of the parties insurance coverage dispute). The MSGN Settlement Agreement was approved by the Court on August 14, 2023, which constituted the final judgment in the action. MSG Networks Inc. has a dispute with its insurers over whether and to what extent there is insurance coverage for the settlement (and has settled with one of the insurers). A s of September 30, 2024 , approximately 18 million has been accrued in Accounts payable, accrued and other current liabilities (reduced from approximately 20.5 million accrued as of March 31, 2024 in connection with the aforementioned settlement) . Unless MSG Networks Inc. and the remaining insurers settle that insurance dispute, it is expected to be finally resolved in a pending Delaware insurance coverage action. 
 47 

The Company is a defendant in various other lawsuits. Although the outcome of these other lawsuits cannot be predicted with certainty (including the extent of available insurance, if any), management does not believe that resolution of these other lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 In addition to the other information set forth below, you should carefully consider the factors discussed under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-Q and our 2024 Form 10-K and other filings we may make from time to time with the SEC. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition, which could cause you to lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we deem immaterial also may affect our business and operations. As such, you should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. 
 Risks Related to Our Indebtedness, Financial Condition, and Internal Control 
 We Have Substantial Indebtedness and Are Highly Leveraged, Which Could Adversely Affect Our Business. 
 We are highly leveraged with a significant amount of debt and we may continue to incur additional debt in the future. As of September 30, 2024, the principal balance of our consolidated debt outstanding was approximately 1.4 billion, 829 million of which matured without repayment on October 11, 2024 and is classified as short-term on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. As a result of our indebtedness, we are required to make interest and principal payments on our borrowings that are significant in relation to our revenues and cash flows. These payments reduce our earnings and cash available for other potential business purposes. Furthermore, our interest expense could increase if interest rates increase (including in connection with rising inflation) because our indebtedness bears interest at floating rates or to the extent we refinance existing debt with higher cost debt. 
 In September 2019, certain subsidiaries of MSG Networks Inc., including MSGN L.P., entered into the MSG Networks Credit Facilities. On October 11, 2024, an event of default occurred pursuant to the MSGN Credit Agreement due to MSGN L.P. s failure to make payment on the outstanding principal amount on the Maturity Date. On October 11, 2024, MSGN L.P., the MSGN Guarantors, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the Supporting Lenders entered into the Forbearance Agreement pursuant to which the Supporting Lenders have agreed, subject to the terms of the Forbearance Agreement, to forbear, during the Forbearance Period, from exercising certain of their available remedies under the MSGN Credit Agreement with respect to or arising out of MSGN L.P. s failure to make payment on the outstanding principal amount under the MSGN Term Loan Facility on the Maturity Date. The Forbearance Period under the Forbearance Agreement was initially scheduled to expire on November 8, 2024 and has been extended to expire on the earlier to occur of (a) November 26, 2024, or such later date agreed to by MSGN L.P. and the Supporting Lenders that hold a majority in principal amount of term loans held by all Supporting Lenders under the MSGN Term Loan Facility and (b) the date on which any Termination Event (as defined in the Forbearance Agreement) occurs. The MSG Networks Credit Facilities are the obligations of our indirect subsidiaries MSGN L.P., MSGN Eden, LLC, Regional MSGN Holdings LLC and certain subsidiaries of MSGN L.P., and none of the Company, Sphere Entertainment Group or any of the subsidiaries of Sphere Entertainment Group (collectively, the Non-Credit Parties are party to the MSG Networks Credit Facilities. 
 On December 22, 2022, MSG LV, entered into the LV Sphere Term Loan Facility, a credit agreement providing for a five-year, 275 million senior secured term loan facility. All obligations under the LV Sphere Term Loan Facility are guaranteed by Sphere Entertainment Group. None of the Company, MSG Networks Inc., MSGN L.P., or any of the subsidiaries of MSGN L.P are parties to the LV Sphere Term Loan Facility. 
 On December 8, 2023, the Company completed the Offering of approximately 259 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes. 
 Our ability to have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations and refinance our indebtedness is dependent on the ability of Sphere to generate significant positive cash flow. There can be no assurance that guests, artists, promoters, advertisers and marketing partners will continue to embrace this new platform and that Sphere will generate revenue and adjusted operating income in line with our expectations. Original immersive productions, such as Postcard From Earth and V-U2 An Immersive Concert Film , have not been previously pursued on the scale of Sphere, which increases the uncertainty of our operating expectations. To the extent that our efforts do not result in viable shows, or to the extent that any such productions do not achieve expected levels of popularity among audiences, we may not generate the cash flows from operations necessary to fund our operations. Our future operating performance, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic conditions, recession, fears of recession, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. To the extent we do not realize expected cash flows from operations from Sphere, we would have to take several actions to improve our financial flexibility and preserve liquidity, including significant reductions in both labor and non-labor expenses as well as reductions and/or deferrals in capital spending. Therefore, while we currently believe we will have sufficient 
 48 

liquidity from cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations (including expected cash flows from operations from Sphere) to fund our operations, no assurance can be provided that our liquidity will be sufficient in the event any of the preceding uncertainties facing Sphere are realized over the next 12 months. 
 In addition, our ability to make payments on, or repay or refinance, our debt, and to fund our operating and capital expenditures, also depends upon our ability to access the credit markets. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and meet our other commitments, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt, sell material assets or operations, or raise additional debt or equity capital, which may be dilutive to our stockholders. We cannot provide assurance that we could effect any of these actions on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that these actions would be sufficient to meet our capital requirements. In addition, the terms of our existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from effecting certain or any of these alternatives. 
 Even if our future operating performance is strong, limitations on our ability to access the capital or credit markets, including as a result of general economic conditions, unfavorable terms or general reductions in liquidity may adversely and materially impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 The failure to make payments when due, satisfy the covenants, including any inability to attain a covenant waiver, and other requirements under each credit agreement could trigger (and, with respect to the MSGN Credit Agreement, has recently triggered) a default thereunder, which could result in an acceleration of the outstanding debt thereunder and, with respect to the LV Sphere Term Loan Facility, a demand for payment under the guarantee provided by Sphere Entertainment Group. Additionally, the LV Sphere Term Loan Facility restricts MSG LV from making cash contributions to us unless certain financial covenants are met and, during the Forbearance Period, the MSG Networks Credit Facilities restrict MSGN L.P. from making cash distributions to us. Any failure to make payments when due or satisfy the covenants under the LV Sphere Term Loan Facility and the MSG Networks Credit Facilities (together, the Credit Facilities could negatively impact our liquidity and could have a negative effect on our businesses. 
 The terms of the Indenture governing the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes do not restrict us from incurring additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness. As of September 30, 2024, (i) the principal balance of the Company s indebtedness (excluding subsidiaries) was approximately 258.8 million under the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes and (ii) the principal balance of indebtedness of the Company s subsidiaries was 1.104 billion, all of which is senior secured indebtedness. This leverage also exposes us to significant risk by limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business (whether through competitive pressure or otherwise), the entertainment and video programming industries and the economy at large. Although our cash flows could decrease in these scenarios, our required payments in respect of indebtedness would not decrease. 
 In addition, the Indenture does not place any limitations on our ability to incur debt or create liens securing indebtedness. If we incur secured indebtedness and such secured indebtedness is either accelerated or becomes subject to a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, our assets would be used to satisfy obligations with respect to the indebtedness secured thereby before any payment could be made on the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes that are not similarly secured. 
 The Indenture also does not restrict our subsidiaries from incurring additional debt, which would be structurally senior to the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes . If new debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify. Our Credit Facilities restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, but if the facilities mature or are repaid, our subsidiaries may not be subject to such restrictions under the terms of any subsequent indebtedness. 
 As described under Part I Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, while the conditions with respect to the MSG Networks Credit Facilities raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern, for the reasons stated under Note 2. Accounting Policies Liquidity and Going Concern, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q with respect to the lenders recourse under the MSG Networks Credit Facilities, we have concluded that the conditions raising substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern have been effectively alleviated as of the date of this Form 10-Q, and that the Company would be able to continue as a going concern for at least one year beyond the date of issuance of the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q. Management will conduct its review of the Company s ability to continue as a going concern prior to issuing the Company s financial statements after each quarterly, annual or transition period. There can be no assurances that we will be able to continue to effectively alleviate the conditions with respect to the Company s ability to continue to be a going concern in the future. 
 In addition, we have made investments in, or otherwise extended loans to, one or more businesses that we believe complement, enhance or expand our current business or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities and may make additional investments in, or otherwise extend loans to, one or more of such parties in the future. For example, we had previously invested in and extended 
 49 

financing to Holoplot in connection with Sphere s advanced audio system, and on April 25, 2024, we completed the acquisition of the remaining equity interest in Holoplot that we did not previously own. To the extent that such parties do not perform as expected, including with respect to repayment of such loans, it could impair such assets or create losses related to such loans, and, as a result, have a negative effect on our business and results of operations. 
 An Event of Default Exists Under the MSG Networks Credit Facilities; Although MSG Networks Is Pursuing a Work-out of Its Credit Facilities, There Can Be No Assurances That It Will Be Successful; Any Refinancing May Require an Equity Contribution by Sphere Entertainment Group to MSG Networks and, Even if a Refinancing is Successfully Consummated, It Would Be on Terms Materially Less Favorable to MSG Networks Than the Current Terms. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the principal balance of debt outstanding under the MSG Networks Credit Facilities was approximately 829.1 million and is classified as short-term on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Under the terms of the MSG Networks Credit Facilities, a 20.6 million required quarterly amortization payment was due and made in September 2024, and the remaining outstanding borrowings under the facility of 829.1 million matured without repayment on October 11, 2024. 
 On October 11, 2024, an event of default occurred pursuant to the MSGN Credit Agreement due to MSGN L.P. s failure to make payment on the outstanding principal amount on the Maturity Date. On October 11, 2024, MSGN L.P., the MSGN Guarantors, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the Supporting Lenders entered into the Forbearance Agreement pursuant to which the Supporting Lenders have agreed, subject to the terms of the Forbearance Agreement, to forbear, during the Forbearance Period, from exercising certain of their available remedies under the MSGN Credit Agreement with respect to or arising out of MSGN L.P. s failure to make payment on the outstanding principal amount under the MSGN Term Loan Facility on the Maturity Date. The Forbearance Period under the Forbearance Agreement was initially scheduled to expire on November 8, 2024 and has been extended to expire on the earlier to occur of (a) November 26, 2024, or such later date agreed to by MSGN L.P. and the Supporting Lenders that hold a majority in principal amount of term loans held by all Supporting Lenders under the MSGN Term Loan Facility and (b) the date on which any Termination Event (as defined in the Forbearance Agreement) occurs. 
 MSG Networks will be unable to settle the remaining outstanding borrowings under the MSG Networks Credit Facilities prior to the expiration of the Forbearance Period absent action taken by management to refinance the outstanding borrowings. As of the issuance date of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, MSG Networks is in the process of pursuing a refinancing through a work-out of the MSG Networks Credit Facilities with its syndicate of lenders. 
 If a refinancing of the outstanding borrowings under the MSG Networks Credit Facilities is successfully consummated, it is expected to require a cash equity contribution from Sphere Entertainment Group to MSG Networks. In addition, such refinancing would be on terms that are materially less favorable to MSG Networks than the current terms, including providing for covenants for the benefit of existing or new lenders that materially restrict the business of MSG Networks. A refinancing may also require MSG Networks, Sphere Entertainment Co. and/or their respective subsidiaries to make concessions as a condition to the refinancing, which may have an adverse effect on their respective businesses, operating results and financial condition. 
 An Event of Default Exists Under the MSG Networks Credit Facilities; Although MSG Networks Is Pursuing a Work-out of Its Credit Facilities, There Can Be No Assurances That It Will Be Successful; If MSG Networks Is Unable to Refinance the MSG Networks Credit Facilities, the Outstanding Debt Thereunder Could Be Accelerated and the Lenders Could Foreclose Upon the MSG Networks Business. 
 MSG Networks will be unable to settle the remaining outstanding borrowings under the MSG Networks Credit Facilities prior to the expiration of the Forbearance Period absent action taken by management to refinance the outstanding borrowings. As of the issuance date of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, MSG Networks is in the process of pursuing a refinancing through a work-out of the MSG Networks Credit Facilities with its syndicate of lenders. 
 In the event MSG Networks is unable to successfully refinance the MSG Networks Credit Facilities, the lenders would have the right to exercise their remedies under the MSG Networks Credit Facilities, which would include, but not be limited to, declaring an event of default and foreclosing on the MSG Networks business. In the event of an exercise of post-default rights or remedies, the Company believes the lenders would have no remedies or recourse against the Non-Credit Parties pursuant to the terms of the MSG Networks Credit Facilities. MSG Networks and its subsidiaries may also decide to seek bankruptcy protection prior to the lenders exercising their rights. If lenders exercise remedies or foreclose on the MSG Networks business, or if MSG Networks decides to seek bankruptcy protection, Sphere Entertainment Co. may no longer be entitled to any value in, or results of operations from, the MSG Networks business.

The Terms of Our Indebtedness Outstanding from Time to Time, Including Our Credit Facilities, Will Restrict Our Current and Future Operations, Particularly Our Ability to Respond to Changes or to Take Certain Actions. 
 The Credit Facilities contain, and future credit facilities are expected to contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on certain of our subsidiaries and may limit our ability to respond to changes in our business or competitive activities, or to otherwise engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our subsidiaries ability to: 
 incur indebtedness; 
 incur liens; 
 make investments; 
 sell and/or otherwise dispose of assets; 
 engage in transactions with affiliates; 
 make certain restricted payments; 
 enter into certain restrictive agreements; 
 enter into sale-leaseback agreements; 
 enter into certain swap agreements; 
 change our line of business; 
 prepay and/or modify the terms of certain indebtedness; and 
 consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets. 
 In addition, the restrictive covenants in the Credit Facilities require certain of our subsidiaries to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may be unable to meet them. 
 A breach of the covenants or restrictions under the Credit Facilities or our other indebtedness outstanding from time to time could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. 
 These restrictions may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy. In addition, our financial results and our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect the availability and terms of our financing. 
 Our Variable Rate Indebtedness Subjects Us to Interest Rate Risk, Which Has Caused, and May Continue to Cause, Our Debt Service Obligations to Increase Significantly. 
 Borrowings under our facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. Interest rates have increased significantly (including in connection with rising inflation), and, as a result, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness have increased significantly even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, have correspondingly decreased. Further increases in interest rates will cause additional increases in our debt service obligations. In the future, we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk. 
 We May Not Have the Ability to Raise the Funds Necessary to Settle Conversions of the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes or to Repurchase the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes Upon a Fundamental Change. 
 Holders of the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture) at a purchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the fundamental change repurchase date (as defined in the Indenture). In addition, we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make purchases of notes surrendered therefor or notes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase the notes or to pay cash upon conversion of the notes is limited by the agreements governing our existing indebtedness (including the Credit Facilities) and may also be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements that will govern our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase 3.50 Convertible 
 51 

Senior Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the Indenture or to pay cash payable on future conversions of the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes as required by the Indenture would constitute a default under the Indenture. 
 A default under the Indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our existing or future indebtedness (including the Credit Facilities). If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes or make cash payments upon conversion thereof. 
 The Conditional Conversion Feature of the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes , If Triggered, May Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition and Operating Results. 
 In the event the conditional conversion feature of the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes is triggered, holders of 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes will be entitled to convert the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes , unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our Class A Common Stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes , we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital. 
 The Fundamental Change Repurchase Feature of the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes May Delay or Prevent an Otherwise Beneficial Attempt to Effect a Change of Control of Our Company. 
 The terms of the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes require us to repurchase the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes in the event of a fundamental change. A change of control of our company would trigger an option of the holders of the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes , as applicable, to require us to repurchase the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes . This may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders. 
 The Capped Call Transactions May Affect the Value of the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes and Our Class A Common Stock. 
 In connection with the pricing of the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes , we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with hedge counterparties. The capped call transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes , the same number of shares of Class A Common Stock that will initially underlie the notes. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to our Class A Common Stock and/or offset potential cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, in each case, upon any conversion of notes, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. If the market price per share of our Class A Common Stock, as measured under the terms of the capped call transactions, exceeds the cap price of the capped call transactions, there would nevertheless be dilution and/or there would not be an offset of such potential cash payments, in each case, to the extent that such market price exceeds the cap price of the capped call transactions. In addition, to the extent any observation period for any converted notes does not correspond to the period during which the market price of our Class A Common Stock is measured under the terms of the capped call transactions, there could also be dilution and/or a reduced offset of any such cash payments as a result of the different measurement periods. 
 The hedge counterparties (and/or their respective affiliates) may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our Class A Common Stock and/or purchasing or selling our Class A Common Stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes (and are likely to do so, to the extent we exercise the relevant election under the capped call transactions, following any repurchase, redemption or conversion of the notes (whether upon a fundamental change or otherwise)). The effect, if any, of these activities on the market price of our Class A Common Stock or the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but any of these activities could cause or prevent an increase or a decline in the market price of our Class A Common Stock or the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes , which could affect the ability of holders to convert the notes and, to the extent the activity occurs following conversion or during any observation period related to a conversion of notes, it could affect the amount of cash and/or the number and value of shares of our Class A Common Stock holders receive upon conversion of the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes . 
 52 

We Are Subject to Counterparty Risk With Respect to the Capped Call Transactions, and the Capped Call Transactions May Not Operate as Planned. 
 The Company used approximately 14.3 million of the net proceeds from the Offering of the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes to fund the cost of entering into capped call transactions with certain of the initial purchasers of the 3.50 Convertible Senior Notes or their respective affiliates and other financial institutions, pursuant to capped call confirmations. The hedge counterparties are financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that any or all of them might default under the capped call transactions. 
 Our exposure to the credit risk of the hedge counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. Past global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If a hedge counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the capped call transactions with such hedge counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated with an increase in the market price and the volatility of our Class A Common Stock. In addition, upon a default by a hedge counterparty, we may suffer more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our Class A Common Stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the hedge counterparties. 
 We May Require Additional Financing to Fund Certain of Our Obligations, Ongoing Operations, and Capital Expenditures, the Availability of Which Is Uncertain. 
 The capital and credit markets can experience volatility and disruption. Those markets can exert extreme downward pressure on stock prices and upward pressure on the cost of new debt capital and can severely restrict credit availability for most issuers. For example, the global economy, including credit and financial markets, has recently experienced extreme volatility and disruptions, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rising interest and inflation rates, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. If the equity and credit markets continue to deteriorate, or the United States enters a recession, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to obtain in a timely manner or on favorable terms, more costly or more dilutive. 
 Our Sphere business has been characterized by significant expenditures for properties, businesses, renovations and productions. We may require additional financing to fund our planned capital expenditures, as well as other obligations and our ongoing operations. In the future, we may engage in transactions that depend on our ability to obtain funding. For example, as we extend Sphere beyond Las Vegas, our intention is to utilize several options, such as joint ventures, equity partners, a managed venue model and non-recourse debt financing. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete these plans. 
 Depending upon conditions in the financial markets and/or the Company s financial performance, we may not be able to raise additional capital on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to pursue our current and future spending programs, we may be forced to cancel or scale back those programs. Failure to successfully pursue our capital expenditure and other spending plans could negatively affect our ability to compete effectively and have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations. 
 We Have Incurred Substantial Operating Losses, Adjusted Operating Losses and Negative Cash Flow and There is No Assurance We Will Have Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income or Positive Cash Flow in the Future. 
 We incurred operating losses of approximately 341 million, 273 million and 166 million for Fiscal Years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We expect these significant operating losses to continue. In addition, we have in prior periods incurred operating losses and negative cash flow. There is no assurance that we will have operating income, adjusted operating income, or positive cash flow in the future. Significant operating losses may limit our ability to raise necessary financing, or to do so on favorable terms, as such losses could be taken into account by potential investors and lenders. 
 Material impairments in the value of our long-lived assets and goodwill could negatively affect our business and results of operations. 
 We regularly review our long-lived assets and goodwill for potential impairment. Long-lived assets, including property and equipment, right-of-use lease assets and intangible assets that are amortized, are reviewed when there is an indication of potential impairment. We test goodwill annually for impairment as of August 31st and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances. We perform our goodwill impairment tests at the level of our two reporting units, Sphere and MSG Networks. In assessing the carrying value of our long-lived assets and goodwill, we make estimates and assumptions regarding a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, projected future cash flows, discount rates, cost-based assumptions and appropriate market comparables. These estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant information, are subjective in nature and involve significant uncertainties and judgments and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying 
 53 

these factors, and, if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges related to our long-lived assets. 
 Changes to our business, unexpected significant declines in our operating results, further deterioration in the business environment for regional sports networks or changes in our strategic goals or business direction could require us to evaluate the recoverability of our goodwill or our long-lived and indefinite lived-assets prior to the annual assessment. These types of events have in the past resulted, and could again in the future result, in impairment charges, which have in the past negatively affected, and could in the future negatively affect, our results of operations. The Company continues to closely monitor the performance and fair value of its MSG Networks reporting unit and results of its potential work-out of the MSG Networks Credit Facilities. A significant adverse change in market factors or the business outlook for the MSG Networks reporting unit could negatively impact the fair value of our MSG Networks reporting unit and result in a goodwill impairment at that time. During the second quarter of Fiscal Year 2024, we recorded an impairment charge of 116.5 million in connection with our decision in November 2023 to no longer pursue the development of a Sphere in the United Kingdom. Impairments could be an indicator of significant declines in the expected performance of our reporting units and could negatively affect our business. For more information on the valuation of long-lived and goodwill, see Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Critical Accounting Estimates Impairment of Goodwill in this Form 10-Q and Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion of Analysis and Financial Condition and Results of Operations Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Critical Accounting Estimates Critical Accounting Estimates in the 2024 Form 10-K. 
 We Are Required to Assess Our Internal Control Over Financial Reporting on an Annual Basis and Our Management Identified a Material Weakness During Fiscal Year 2022, Which Has Now Been Remediated. If We Identify Other Material Weaknesses or Adverse Findings in the Future, Our Ability to Report Our Financial Condition or Results of Operations Accurately or Timely May Be Adversely Affected, Which May Result in a Loss of Investor Confidence in Our Financial Reports, Significant Expenses to Remediate Any Internal Control Deficiencies, and Ultimately Have an Adverse Effect on the Market Price of Our Class A Common Stock and the Value of the 3.50 Convertible Senior Note s . 
 Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, our management is required to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, we will not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. If we fail to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment, we could suffer misstatements in our financial statements and fail to meet our reporting obligations, which would likely cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. This could result in significant expenses to remediate any internal control deficiencies and lead to a decline in our stock price. 
 Subsequent to the filing of the Fiscal Year 2021 Form 10-K, management of the Company evaluated an immaterial accounting error related to interest costs that should have been capitalized for Sphere in Las Vegas in Fiscal Years 2021, 2020 and 2019 and in the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2021, as prescribed by Accounting Standards Codification Topic 835-20 (Capitalization of Interest). As a result of the accounting error, the Company re-evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting and identified a material weakness as of June 30, 2021, September 30, 2021, December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022. We undertook certain remediation efforts by implementing additional controls which were operating effectively as of June 30, 2022, and as a result, our management concluded that the material weakness has been remediated and our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2022. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 Our management may be unable to conclude in future periods that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective due to the effects of various factors, which may, in part, include unremediated material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in those reports is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In addition, we may not be able to identify and remediate other control deficiencies, including material weaknesses, in the future. 
 54 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had the ability to repurchase up to 350 million of the Company s Class A Common Stock under the Class A Common Stock share repurchase program initially authorized by the Company s Board of Directors on March 31, 2020 and reauthorized on March 29, 2023. Under the authorization, shares of Class A Common Stock may be purchased from time to time in open market transactions, in accordance with applicable insider trading and other securities laws and regulations. The timing and amount of purchases will depend on market conditions and other factors. No shares have been repurchased to date.
