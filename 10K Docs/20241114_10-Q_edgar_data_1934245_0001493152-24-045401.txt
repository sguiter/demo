and used cash in operations of . These factors
raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date of the financial
statements being issued. In addition, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on the Company s
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, expressed substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
this uncertainty. 

At
September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents on hand in the amount of . The Company expects its cash on hand
on September 30, 2024, to last for at least the next three months. 

The
continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain necessary debt or equity financing to continue
operations until it begins generating positive cash flow. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if
available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing,
it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders,
in case or equity financing. 

Nasdaq
Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard 

On
December 5, 2023, the Company received a deficiency letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC Nasdaq notifying the Company that, for the preceding 30 consecutive business days, the closing bid price of the Company s
common stock remained below the minimum per share requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market as set forth in
Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Bid Price Requirement ). The Company was provided a compliance period of 180 calendar
days from the date of the letter, or until June 3, 2024, to regain compliance with the Bid Price Requirement. 

On
June 4, 2024, the Company received a staff determination letter (the Determination Letter from the Staff notifying the
Company that it had not regained compliance with the Bid Price Requirement by June 3, 2024, and is not eligible for a second 180-day
period due to the Company s failure to comply with the minimum stockholders equity initial listing requirement of the Nasdaq
Capital Market. 

Pursuant
to the Determination Letter, the Company requested a hearing before a Hearings Panel (the Panel ). The hearing request automatically
stayed any suspension or delisting action pending the hearing and the expiration of any additional extension period granted by the Panel
following the hearing. . By letter dated August 13,2024 from the Nasdaq Office of General Counsel, the Company was informed that it has
regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of per share under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). 

Reverse
Stock Split 

On
July 18, 2024, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to amend its Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of
Delaware to effect a reverse stock split of the Company s common stock at a ratio of (the Reverse Stock
Split ). The Reverse Stock Split became effective as of 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on July 30, 2024 and the Company s common
stock began trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market on a post-split basis under its existing trading symbol. 

As
a result of the Reverse Split, every ten shares of common stock were automatically combined into one share of common stock. The authorized
number of shares of common stock was not affected by the Reverse Stock Split. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the
Reverse Stock Split, as all fractional shares were rounded up to the next whole share. Accordingly, all share and per share amounts presented
herein with respect to common stock have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split for all periods presented. Proportionate
adjustments for the Reverse Stock Split have been made to the per share exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon the exercise
of warrants, the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Company s equity plans, and all the then outstanding awards under
the Company s equity plans. The Reverse Stock Split will not change the par value of the common stock or modify any voting rights
or other terms of the common stock.

and 
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, 

The
fair value of each option is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company was a private company through August
14, 2023, and lacks company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, it estimates its expected stock volatility
based on the historical volatility of a publicly traded set of peer companies within the consumer products industry with characteristics
similar to the Company. The expected term of the Company s stock options has been determined utilizing the simplified 
method for awards that qualify as plain-vanilla options. The expected term of stock options granted to non-employees is
equal to the contractual term of the option award. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield
curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. The expected
dividend yield is zero, based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends
in the foreseeable future. 

Prior
to August 14, 2023, the common shares of the Company were not publicly traded. As such, during the period, the Company estimated the
fair value of common stock using an appropriate valuation methodology, in accordance with the framework of the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants Technical Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation.
Each valuation methodology includes estimates and assumptions that require the Company s judgment. These estimates and assumptions
include a number of objective and subjective factors, including external market conditions, guideline public company information, the
prices at which the Company sold its common stock to third parties in arms length transactions, the rights and preferences of
securities senior to the Company s common stock at the time, and the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event such as an initial
public offering or sale. Significant changes to the assumptions used in the valuations could result in different fair values of stock
options at each valuation date, as applicable. 

. From time to time, however, the Company may be exposed to risk for the amounts of funds held in bank accounts in excess
of the FDIC limit. To minimize the risk, the Company s policy is to maintain cash balances with high quality financial institutions.
All of the non-interest bearing cash balances were fully insured at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Accounts

Company
Overview 

We
are a technology-forward golf company, with a growing portfolio of golf products, including putting instruments, golf shafts, golf grips,
and other golf related products. In consideration of our growth opportunities in shaft technologies, in April of 2022, we expanded our
manufacturing business to include advanced premium golf shafts by opening a new shaft manufacturing facility in St. Joseph, MO. It is
our intent to manufacture and assemble substantially all products in the United States. We anticipate expansion into golf apparel and
other golf related product lines to enhance our growth. Our future expansions may include broadening our offerings through mergers, acquisitions
or internal developments of product lines that are complementary to our premium brand. 

On
August 14, 2023, we entered into an underwriting agreement with The Benchmark Company for the purchase of shares of the Company s
common stock, in an offering of securities registered under an effective registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange

Newton
Shafts 

On
November 20, 2023, we announced a significant expansion of our product portfolio. We introduced Newton, the Company s
latest business division and the Company s first foray into the world of golf club shafts. The Newton Motion driver shaft, the

Nasdaq
Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard 

On
December 5, 2023, the Company received a deficiency letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC Nasdaq notifying the Company that, for the preceding 30 consecutive business days, the closing bid price of the Company s
common stock remained below the minimum 1.00 per share requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market as set forth in
Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Bid Price Requirement ). The Company was provided a compliance period of 180 calendar
days from the date of the letter, or until June 3, 2024, to regain compliance with the Bid Price Requirement. 

On
June 4,2024, the Company received a staff determination letter (the Determination Letter from the Staff notifying the
Company that it had not regained compliance with the Bid Price Requirement by June 3, 2024, and is not eligible for a second 180-day
period due to the Company s failure to comply with the minimum stockholders equity initial listing requirement of The Nasdaq
Capital Market. 

1 

Pursuant
to the Determination Letter, the Company requested a hearing before a Hearings Panel (the Panel ). The hearing request automatically
stayed any suspension or delisting action pending the hearing and the expiration of any additional extension period granted by the Panel
following the hearing. By letter dated June 24,2024, the Company was notified that the Panel granted the Company a temporary exception
to regain compliance with the Bid Price Requirement subject to the following milestones: (1) on or before July 31,2024, the Company must
effect a reverse stock split and, thereafter maintain a 1.00 closing bid price for a minimum of ten consecutive business days; and (2)
on or before August 13,2024, the Company must demonstrate compliance with the Bid Price requirement by evidencing a closing bid price
of 1.00 or more for a minimum of ten consecutive trading sessions. As set forth below, the Company effected a reverse stock split on
July 30,2024. By letter dated August 13,2024 from the Nasdaq Office of General Counsel, the Company was informed that it has regained
compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of 1.00 per share under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). 

Reverse
Stock Split 

On
July 18, 2024, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to amend its Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of
Delaware to effect a reverse stock split of the Company s common stock at a ratio of 1-for-10 shares (the Reverse Stock
Split ). The Reverse Stock Split became effective as of 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on July 30, 2024 and the Company s common
stock began trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market on a post-split basis under its existing trading symbol. 

As
a result of the Reverse Split, every ten shares of common stock were automatically combined into one share of common stock. The authorized
number of shares of common stock was not affected by the Reverse Stock Split. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the
Reverse Stock Split, as all fractional shares were rounded up to the next whole share. Accordingly, all share and per share amounts presented
herein with respect to common stock have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split for all periods presented. Proportionate
adjustments for the Reverse Stock Split have been made to the per share exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon the exercise
of warrants, the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Company s equity plans, and all the then outstanding awards under
the Company s equity plans. The Reverse Stock Split will not change the par value of the common stock or modify any voting rights
or other terms of common stock. 

Key
Factors Affecting Our Performance 

Seasonality
and General Trends in Golf Participation 

Because
golf is a seasonal sport, our sales are cyclical and unlikely to remain consistent from quarter to quarter. Further, if golf participation
decreases or the number of rounds of golf played decreases generally, for any or no reason, sales of our products may be adversely affected.
In the future, the overall dollar volume of the market for golf-related products may not grow or may decline. The recent COVID-19 pandemic
has resulted in a surge in golf participation and growth for our industry, but such a trend may not continue, and future trends are difficult
to predict. 

Public
Company Costs 

Effective
August 17, 2023, our Common Stock was registered with the SEC and listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, which requires us to hire additional
personnel and implement public company procedures and processes. We incur additional annual expenses as a public company for internal
controls compliance and public company reporting obligations, directors and officers liability insurance, director fees
and additional internal and external accounting and legal and administrative resources, including increased audit and legal fees. 

Impact
of Inflation 

Recent
inflationary trends have led to a moderate increase in some of the component parts used to manufacture our products. To date, we have
not passed the increase in cost to our consumers. Continued prolonged periods of inflationary pressure on some or all costs may result
in increased costs to produce our products that could have an adverse effect on profits from sales of these products or require us to
increase prices for our products that could adversely affect consumer demand for our products.

While
we have not had significant other disruptions that materially impacted our financial results, we continue to seek and expand the number
of qualified domestic vendors used to source materials.

Net
Sales 

Our
net sales increased 1,116,000, or 1,175 , to 1,211,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 95,000 during
the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net sales was from the introduction of our Newton Motion driver shaft product
line in November 2023, and our Newton Motion fairway shaft product line in April 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2024,
we generated 1,182,000 of net sales from the Newton Motion shafts, and we generated approximately 95 of our net sales through our websites. 

Cost
of goods sold 

Cost
of goods sold represents primarily our material, labor, components, and changes in inventory reserves for slow-moving or potentially
obsolete products. Our cost of goods sold increased by 350,000 to 406,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to
 56,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to our increase in net sales. Our gross margin was 66 and 41 for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in gross margin was due to the change in product mix sold as compared
to the prior year period. 

Operating
expenses 

Operating
expenses include selling, general and administrative expenses, and research and development costs. 

Selling,
general and administrative expenses include employee costs, legal and professional fees, sales and marketing expenses, stock based compensation,
public company expenses, rent, depreciation and other general expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately
 499,000 to 1.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.2 million during the three months ended September
30, 2023. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was from increased employee related expenses, increased public
company related costs, increased advertising expense, and from routine changes in our selling, general and administrative expenses accounts
to support our operations, as compared to the prior year period. 

3 

Research
and development costs include employee costs, consultants, licensing fees, and product design and development costs. Research and development
expenses increased 186,000 to 201,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 15,000 during the three months
ended September 30, 2023. The increase in research and development costs were due to costs incurred to test and refine prior to the commercialization
of our Newton Motion fairway wood shaft product, which was launched in early April 2024. In addition, beginning in October 2023, the
employment costs of our Chief Technology Officer and Vice President of Research Development were recorded as a component of our
research and development expenses, which we previously recorded to selling general and administrative expenses. 

Loss
from operations 

Loss
from operations decreased from 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to 1.1 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in our loss from operations was due to our increased net sales and gross profit, offset by increased
operating expenses as discussed above. 

Interest
income (expense), net 

Interest
income was 30,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to interest expense of 26,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2023. The decrease in interest expense was due to our paying off our debt with the proceeds received from our initial public
offering in August 2023, and the increase in interest income was due to interest earned on our bank balances, as compared to the prior
year period. 

Net
loss 

Net
loss decreased from 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to 1.1 million for the three months ended September
30, 2024. The decrease in our net loss was due to our increased net sales and gross profit, offset by increased operating expenses, as
discussed above.

 134,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to our increase in net sales. Our gross margin was 63 and 42 for the nine

to our inventory reserves as compared to the prior year period.

Net
cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 3.4 million, compared to net cash used in operating
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 3.8 million. The decrease in net cash used in operations for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, was primarily related to cash used to repay our accrued payroll to officers. 

Investing
Activities 

Net
cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 463,000, and was for the purchase of property
and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled 101,000, and was for the purchase
of property and equipment. 

Financing
Activities 

Net
cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 131,000, and was for repayment of our software
licensing obligation and deferred offering costs. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023
was 10.5 million, which primarily related to proceeds of 11.1 million received from the public sale of our common stock. 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement
of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. 

On
August 14, 2023, we entered into an underwriting agreement with The Benchmark Company for the purchase of shares of the Company s
common stock, in an offering of securities registered under an effective registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. In the offering, the Company sold 320,000 shares of common stock, at a price of 40.00 per share. The offering closed on
August 17, 2023, and total proceeds received, net of fees, were 11,594,000 including an underwriting discount of 7 and a non-accountable
expenses allowance of 1 based on the aggregate proceeds of the offering. 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement
of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, during the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss of 3.4 million and used cash in operations of 3.4 million. These factors raise
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date of the financial statements
being issued. In addition, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on the Company s consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, expressed substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern. 

At
September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents on hand in the amount of 1.3 million. Management expects its cash on hand on September
30, 2024, to last for at least the next 3 months. 

6 

The
continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain necessary debt or equity financing to continue
operations until it begins generating positive cash flow. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if
available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing,
it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders,
in case or equity financing. 

Emerging
Growth Company 

We
are an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, which we refer to as the
JOBS Act. We would cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of: (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our
annual gross revenues are 1.07 billion or more; (ii) the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by
non-affiliates exceeded 700 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year; or (iii) the date on which we have, during
the previous three-year period, issued more than 1.07 billion in non-convertible debt securities. An emerging growth company may take
advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. We have elected
to take advantage of these reduced disclosure obligations and may elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting obligations in the
future. 

For
so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to: 

comply
 with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation
 or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e.,
 an auditor discussion and analysis); 

have
 an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; 

submit
 certain executive compensation matters to stockholder advisory votes, such as say-on-pay, say-on-frequency 
 and pay ratio; and 

disclose
 certain executive compensation-related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons
 of the CEO s compensation to median employee compensation. 

In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an EGC can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section
7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. As a result, the Company may adopt new or revised
accounting standards by the date private companies are required to comply. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

At
September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any transactions, obligations or relationships that could be considered
off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
discussion and analysis of our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity are based upon our consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared and audited in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates
and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, stockholders equity, revenues and expenses, as well as
related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions
that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions. On an ongoing basis, we review our estimates to ensure that the estimates appropriately reflect changes in
our business and new information as it becomes available. 

Management
believes the critical accounting estimates discussed below affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation
of its consolidated financial statements.

Revenue
Recognition 

We
account for revenue recognition in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 606, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers. 

The
amount of revenue we recognize is based on the amount of consideration we expect to receive from customers. The amount of consideration
is the sales price adjusted for estimates of variable consideration, including sales returns, discounts and allowances as well as sales
programs, sales promotions and price concessions that we offer, as described further below. These estimates are based on amounts earned
or expected to be claimed by customers on the related sales, and are therefore recorded to the respective net revenue, trade accounts
receivable, and sales program liability accounts. 

We
may offer short-term sales program incentives, which include sell-through promotions and price concessions or price reductions. Sell-through
promotions are generally offered throughout a product s life cycle, which varies from two to three years but could be shorter or
longer. Price concessions or price reductions are generally offered at the end of the product s life cycle. The estimated variable
consideration related to these potential programs will be based on a rate that includes historical and forecasted data. We may record
a reduction to net revenues using this rate at the time of the sale. We will monitor this rate against actual results and forecasted
estimates and adjusts the rate as necessary in order to reflect the amount of consideration it expects to receive from its customers. 

We
also may record an estimate for anticipated returns as a reduction of sales and cost of sales, and accounts receivable in the period
that the related sales are recorded. The cost recovery of inventory associated with this reserve will be accounted for in other current
assets. Sales returns will be estimated based upon historical returns, current economic trends, changes in customer demands and sell-through
of products. We also may offer certain customers sales programs that would allow for specific returns. We may record a return reserve
for anticipated returns related to these sales programs at the time of the sale based on the terms of the sales program. 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

The
Company periodically issues stock options to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for services and for financing
costs. The Company accounts for such grants issued and vesting based on ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation whereby the value
of the award is measured on the date of grant and recognized for employees as compensation expense on the straight-line basis over the
vesting period. The Company recognizes the fair value of stock-based compensation within its Statements of Operations with classification
depending on the nature of the services rendered. 

The
fair value of each option or warrant grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company was a private company
through August 14, 2023, and lacks company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, it estimates its expected
stock volatility based on the historical volatility of a publicly traded set of peer companies within the consumer products industry
with characteristics similar to the Company. The expected term of the Company s stock options has been determined utilizing the
 simplified method for awards that qualify as plain-vanilla options. The expected term of stock options granted
to non-employees is equal to the contractual term of the option award. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the
U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the
award. The expected dividend yield is zero, based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay
any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. 

Prior
to August 14, 2023, the common shares of the Company were not publicly traded. As such, during the period, the Company estimated the
fair value of common stock using an appropriate valuation methodology, in accordance with the framework of the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants Technical Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation.
Each valuation methodology includes estimates and assumptions that require the Company s judgment. These estimates and assumptions
include a number of objective and subjective factors, including external market conditions, guideline public company information, the
prices at which the Company sold its common stock to third parties in arms length transactions, the rights and preferences of
securities senior to the Company s common stock at the time, and the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event such as an initial
public offering or sale. Significant changes to the assumptions used in the valuations could result in different fair values of stock
options at each valuation date, as applicable.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure control and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer,
we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Based on this evaluation, our Executive Chairman and our Chief Financial
Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024, to provide reasonable
assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our Executive Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

Inherent
Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 

Management
does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all
errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control systems are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective
control system, no evaluation of internal control over financial reporting can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error
or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been or will be detected. 

These
inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a
simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people,
or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood
of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
