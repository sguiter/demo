Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. You should read the following discussion in conjunction with our financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this report. The following information contains forward-looking statements. (See Forward-Looking Statements below.) FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This report contains forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements reflect the Company s views with respect to future events based upon information available to it at this time. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. The words anticipates, believes, estimates, expects, plans, projects, targets, and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date the statement was made. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, changes in assumptions, future events or otherwise. General The Company is a shell company that conducts no active business operations and is seeking business opportunities for acquisition or participation by the Company. The Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on the Company s December 31, 2023 audited financial statements addresses an uncertainty about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern, indicating that the Company has incurred losses since its inception and has no on-going operations. The report further indicates that these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. At September 30, 2024, the Company had a working capital deficit of 862,933 and an accumulated deficit since inception of 1,406,547. The Company incurred net losses of 128,668 and 72,746 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain the additional debt or equity capital required to continue its operations. On or about September 20, 2024, the Company and SILQ Technologies Corporation, a Delaware corporation SILQ ), entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the Agreement wherein the Company will acquire SILQ pursuant to a reverse triangular merger (the Merger ), as further described in the Company s Form 8-K filed September 25, 2024. There are no assurances that the Merger will be consummated. There are many conditions to closing, many of which are outside of the parties control, and we cannot predict whether these conditions will be satisfied. There are no assurances when or if closing will occur. The Three and nine Months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023 The Company did not conduct any operations during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. At September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and total current assets in the amount of 17,153, compared to 138 at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the Company had total current liabilities of 880,086, compared to 776,403 at December 31, 2023. The Company had a working capital deficit of 862,933 at September 30, 2024 compared to 776,265 at December 31, 2023. The Company did not generate revenues during the nine-month periods ending September 30, 2024 or 2023. The Company incurred general and administrative expenses of 39,284 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 10,004 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company incurred general and administrative expenses of 89,483 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 36,843 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Such expenses consist primarily of legal and accounting fees as well as taxes and annual fees required to maintain the Company s corporate status. 4 Table of Contents The Company incurred other expenses of 13,799 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 12,296 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company incurred other expenses of 39,185 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 35,903 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Total other income and expenses consist of interest expense related to the notes payable due from the Company. The Company incurred a net loss of 53,083 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of 22,300 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company incurred a net loss of 128,668 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of 72,746 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company has never had substantial ongoing operations. As a result, since its inception on July 26, 1990, the Company had an accumulated deficit of 1,406,547 as of September 30, 2024. Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash used by operating activities was 78,190 and 16,112 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net cash provided by investing activities was -0- during both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Net cash provided by financing activities was 95,205 and 16,300 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and consisted of loans received from related and unrelated parties. Since the Company does not generate any revenues from operations, it is dependent on sales of securities, loans, or contributions from its stockholders in order to pay its operating costs. In addition, in the event the Company locates a suitable candidate for potential acquisition, the Company will require additional funds to pay the costs of negotiating and completing the acquisition of such candidate. Other than as noted elsewhere in this filing the Company has not entered into any agreement or arrangement for the provision of any additional funding and no assurances can be given that such funding will be available to the Company on terms acceptable to it or at all. The Company cannot presently foresee the cash requirements of any business opportunity which may ultimately be acquired by the Company. However, since it is likely that any business it acquires will be involved in active business operations, the Company anticipates that an acquisition will result in increased cash requirements as well as increases in the number of employees of the Company. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that are material to investors. Critical Accounting Policies Due to the lack of current operations and limited business activities, the Company does not have any accounting policies that it believes are critical to facilitate an investor s understanding of the Company s financial and operating status. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Not Applicable. The Company is a smaller reporting company. 5 Table of Contents Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the Exchange Act as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this report, utilizing the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission s 2013 update to the Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 were not effective such that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. A controls system cannot provide absolute assurance, however, that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that: Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. We carried out an assessment, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and Interim CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of September 30, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Based on that assessment and on those criteria, our CEO and Interim CFO concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2024. The principal basis for this conclusion is (i) failure to engage sufficient resources regarding our accounting and reporting obligations during our startup and (ii) failure to fully document our internal control policies and procedures. This quarterly report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. The management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only the management s report in this quarterly report. The Company s management, including the Company s CEO and Interim CFO, does not expect that the Company s internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 6 Table of Contents Part II---OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.
