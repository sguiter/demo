The impairment charges were recorded to impairment and disposal of long-lived assets, net of recoveries on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and were derived from the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the relevant asset, minus estimated selling costs. The fair value was estimated using an income capitalization approach with estimates and assumptions regarding the asset's future cash flows and return on investment (Level 3). Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest 
 
 One of the Company s consolidated variable interest entities ("VIE") is party to a shareholder agreement which provides certain of the non-controlling interest holders with optional redemption rights where they may put their shares in the consolidated subsidiary to the Company in exchange for a fixed number of Company shares. The non-controlling interest is redeemable at the option of the shareholder and is therefore recorded in temporary or "mezzanine" equity on the condensed consolidated balance sheets in accordance with ASC Topic 480-10-S99. Certain put holders are required to pay a subscription fee prior to their put right becoming exercisable. 
 
 During the first quarter of 2024, certain redeemable non-controlling interest holders executed their put rights following the payment of their subscription amount to the consolidated subsidiary, resulting in the issuance of of Company Shares. This redemption resulted in an increase in the Company's ownership interest to from . 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the currently redeemable non-controlling interest could be settled with the issuance of shares with a redemption value totaling million.

 Overview 
 
 Trulieve Cannabis Corp. is a reporting issuer in the United States and Canada. The Company s Subordinate Voting Shares (as hereinafter defined) are listed for trading on the Canadian Securities Exchange CSE under the symbol TRUL and are also traded in the United States on the OTCQX Best Market OTCQX under the symbol TCNNF . 
 
 Trulieve is a vertically integrated cannabis company and multi-state operator with operations in nine states. Headquartered in Quincy, Florida, we are the largest cannabis retailer in the United States with market leading retail operations in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. We are committed to delivering exceptional customer experiences through elevated service and high-quality branded products. We aim to be the brand of choice for medical and adult-use customers in all of the markets that we serve. The Company operates in highly regulated markets that require expertise in cultivation, manufacturing, and retail. We have developed proficiencies in each of these functional areas and are passionate about expanding access to regulated cannabis products through advocacy, education and expansion of our distribution network. 
 
 All of the states in which we operate have developed programs to permit the use of cannabis products for medicinal purposes to treat specific conditions and diseases, which we refer to as medical cannabis. Recreational cannabis, or adult-use cannabis, is legal cannabis sold in licensed dispensaries to adults ages 21 and older. Thus far, of the states in which we operate, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, and Ohio, have already launched programs permitting the commercialization of adult-use cannabis products. Trulieve operates its business through its directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries which hold licenses and have entered into managed service agreements in the states in which they operate.

 Regional Hub Structure 
 
 Trulieve s production, retail and distribution areas are organized into regional hubs whereby teams and assets are aggregated in order to effectively pair national structure and support with localized operations tailored to each market. Trulieve has established cannabis operations in three hubs: Southeast, Northeast, and Southwest. Each of our three regional hubs are anchored by market leading positions in cornerstone states of Florida, Pennsylvania, and Arizona. 
 
 In Florida and Georgia, Trulieve cultivates, processes, and manufactures all cannabis products sold in our dispensaries. In other markets including Arizona, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, we have achieved varying percentages of vertical integration with cultivation and processing operations to support our retail and wholesale businesses. Our investments in vertically integrated operations in several of our markets afford us ownership of the entire supply chain, which mitigates third-party risks and allows us to completely control product quality and brand experience. Trulieve employs an in-house quality team as well as independent testing laboratories in select markets, both of which allow us to more tightly control product quality. 
 Cultivation and Manufacturing of Cannabis Products 
 
 Trulieve produces high quality cannabis flower for direct consumption and uses a variety of processes to transform high-quality biomass into products sold through our retail and wholesale distribution network. With a focus on replicable, scalable operations, we have developed design standards, standard operating procedures, and training protocols that are employed across cultivation sites to achieve a high level of consistency and quality. The modular nature of our standard designs enables quick and incremental additions to capacity where appropriate. In Florida, where demand is high enough to support larger scale production, our state-of-the-art 750,000 square foot indoor cultivation facility affords us greater flexibility for pricing, promotional cadence, and assortment in the Florida market by enabling production of high potency and high quality products at lower costs. 
 
 We produce a wide variety of oil derivative products featuring cannabinoids. We own manufacturing technology that utilizes various extraction techniques including supercritical ethanol extraction, carbon dioxide extraction, hydrocarbon extraction, and mechanical separation. We have invested in light hydrocarbon extraction processes, allowing for concentrates that preserve the natural ratios of cannabinoids, terpenes, and other target compounds to better replicate the flower experience. Light hydrocarbon extraction also offers the benefit of greater extraction yields in many cases. 
 Distribution of Branded Product through Branded Retail 
 
 Distribution of branded products through our branded retail locations is a core driver of our long-term strategy. We have developed and acquired a curated portfolio of our own branded retail products that we cultivate, manufacture and distribute throughout our branded retail locations. By providing customers with consistent high-quality products and outstanding experiences we aim to garner a large and loyal customer base across our distribution network.

 Customer Experience 
 
 Since inception, Trulieve has prioritized creating exceptional customer experiences, developing the business to center around the Trulieve philosophy of Customers First . This customer centric approach permeates our culture and informs strategic decision making. 
 
 Our goal is to foster brand loyalty by providing customers with industry-leading branded products and superior service in an appealing, approachable setting. We accomplish this by creating and reinforcing positive customer experiences across the entire customer journey. We employ and continuously refine numerous training programs to provide our associates with the resources they need to deliver outstanding customer experiences across the entire Trulieve platform. We offer specialized management training and incentives to reward positive outcomes so there is continuous reinforcement of customer experience best practices. 
 Marketing 
 
 Trulieve s marketing strategies are tailored to address the unique attributes of the markets in which we operate. Generally, in markets where we serve medical patients, our messaging centers around education and outreach for physicians and medical patients. Our educational materials are designed to help physicians understand cannabinoid science, the high standards pursuant to which our plants are cultivated, the processes required for regulatory compliance, and how our products provide relief for their patients. Patients primarily learn about us through their physicians, patient-centric community events, and digital marketing. We regularly participate in outreach and community events. An engaged audience is captured through our digital content marketing and via multiple popular social media platforms. 
 
 We regularly engage with various communities who may benefit from cannabis, such as veterans, seniors, organizations that serve qualifying populations as well as various health and wellness groups. Search engine optimization of our website also captures potential customers researching the benefits of cannabis, which offers another pathway to informative materials about cannabis, our products and how to legally access them. 
 
 In adult-use markets, marketing efforts aim to attract customers with varying levels of awareness of cannabis and Trulieve. We continue to delineate and refine our understanding of various customer personas, which factors such as location, products and pricing attract and retain customers, and which incentives are effective in driving specific outcomes. Connecting with a broader audience requires different strategies that inspire, tap into relevant cultural moments in their lives, build community as well as educate customers on our products uniqueness versus our competitors. 
 
 We understand each consumer has unique communication preferences and capabilities. As such, we engage with customers and physicians through a variety of methods including email, text, social media and online chat. In select markets we offer various purchase options, including phone ordering, online ordering, home delivery, and in-store. As Trulieve continues to expand, we have developed a standardized rewards program to serve all markets as appropriate within existing regulatory frameworks, and this new program was completed in all markets in the second quarter of 2024. The program features fully stackable points which can be redeemed across all of our brands and markets. The rewards program itself was built inside of our customer data platform, allowing interconnectivity between rewards, website, and the customer data platform.

 Investments in Infrastructure and Technology Platforms 
 
 We have made significant investments in developing and deploying technology and data platforms designed to support scaled operations and growth in customers served and units sold. Through our customer data platform, we are able to collect and analyze data to discern customer preferences, patterns, and trends which inform our production mix, product allocation, promotional strategies and targeted outreach. Investments in our enterprise grade platforms enable greater sophistication across production, retail, and wholesale operations and numerous support functions including accounting and finance, human resources, legal and compliance. We believe infrastructure and data capabilities are prerequisites for long term success in an increasingly competitive and integrated commerce environment. 
 
 Competitive Conditions and Position 
 
 The markets in which we operate are highly competitive markets with relatively high barriers to entry given the licensed nature of the cannabis industry. See Regulatory Overview in Item 1 - Business and Item 1A - Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the impact of regulation on our business. We compete directly with cannabis producers and retailers within single-state operating markets, as well as those that operate across several U.S. state markets. 
 
 The vast majority of both manufacturing and retail competitors in our markets consist of localized or regional businesses with operations in a single state market. Other multi-state cannabis operators compete directly in several of our operating markets. Aside from this direct competition, out-of-state operators that are capitalized well enough to enter those markets through acquisitions are also part of the competitive landscape. Similarly, as we execute on our regional hub strategy and expand across the U.S., operators in our future state markets will inevitably become direct competitors. Increased competition by larger and better financed competitors could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We face additional competition from new entrants. If the number of consumers of medical and adult-use cannabis in our markets increases, the demand for products will increase and we expect that competition will become more intense, as current and future competitors begin to offer an increasing number of diversified products. We expect to continue to invest in several areas, including customer experience, product innovation, scaled production, marketing and branding, and distribution network expansion. Trulieve may not have sufficient resources to maintain investments on a competitive basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The management team monitors developments in the fast-paced cannabis industry and adjacent industries to help us remain competitive. 
 
 We also compete indirectly with operators in the illicit market for cannabis and manufacturers and retailers of intoxicating hemp products. 
 
 Seasonality 
 
 Our business operates year-round. Operations and sales trends in select markets do follow seasonal trends at various times of the year providing seasonal impacts on sales in summer and winter months and increases from promotional activity around specific industry and holiday events including 4/20, 7/10, and Green Wednesday (the Wednesday before Thanksgiving). 
 
 Recent Developments 
 On April 1, 2024, the Florida Supreme Court ruled affirmatively to place the Smart Safe Florida initiative on the 2024 General Election Ballot which, if passed, will allow adults over the age of 21 to purchase cannabis products for personal consumption in the state of Florida. The initiative is on the ballot in Florida as a constitutional amendment with an election date set for November 5, 2024. In Florida, constitutional amendments require a 60 supermajority vote of approval to pass.

 On April 30, 2024, the United States Department of Justice recommended marijuana be rescheduled from a Schedule I to Schedule III controlled substance, and published a notice of proposed rulemaking on May 21, 2024. There was a sixty-day comment period for the proposed rulemaking, which closed on July 22, 2024. Over 43,000 comments were received, with an overwhelming majority of comments advocating for Schedule III rescheduling or descheduling altogether. The notice of proposed rulemaking is but one step in a complex administrative and political process involving numerous stakeholders whose commitment to rescheduling marijuana is unclear. The preliminary hearing for rescheduling is currently scheduled for December 2, 2024. 
 
 On May 30, 2024, in connection with a litigation settlement, Trulieve acquired Harvest of Ohio, LLC, which holds licenses for medical cannabis dispensaries in Columbus and Beavercreek. Both dispensaries are eligible to convert the medical license to a dual-use license, which will allow for adult use sales. Also in connection with the litigation settlement, we entered into service agreements to provide operational support to a cultivation and processing facility. On August 6, 2024, in accordance with approval received from the Ohio Division of Cannabis Control, our dispensaries in Columbus, Westerville, and Beavercreek began adult-use sales. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant estimates in our condensed consolidated financial statements, include, but are not limited to, accounting for acquisitions and business combinations; initial valuation and subsequent impairment testing of goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets; leases; fair value of financial instruments, income taxes; inventory; share-based payment arrangements, and commitment and contingencies. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. 
 
 The Company s accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are described in the Company s fiscal 2023 Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024, under the caption Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates.

 Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 284.3 million, an increase of 9.1 million, or 3.3 , from 275.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily the result of a 6.1 million increase in retail revenue and a 3.0 million increase in wholesale revenue. 
 
 The increase in retail revenue was partially driven by the opening of additional dispensaries; the Company operated 215 dispensaries as of September 30, 2024 as compared to 188 as of September 30, 2023. This was partially offset by macroeconomic pressures driving a portion of our customers spending habits towards lower priced products. 
 
 The increase in wholesale revenue was primarily driven by sales in Maryland and Pennsylvania. 
 
 Cost of Goods Sold 
 
 Cost of goods sold for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 111.0 million, a decrease of 21.3 million, or 16.1 , from 132.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to year over year improvements in at-scale cost efficiencies from our production facilities.

Gross Profit 
 
 Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 173.3 million, an increase of 30.3 million, or 21.2 , from 142.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 61.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 51.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was driven by increased revenue and decreased cost of goods sold due to year-over-year improvements in at-scale cost efficiencies from our production facilities. 
 
 Sales and Marketing Expense 
 
 Sales and marketing expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 66.7 million, an increase of 7.3 million, or 12.3 , from 59.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the increase in overall store count. Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenues was 23.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 21.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the percentage of revenue was driven by 27 new stores opened since the end of the third quarter in 2023. Additionally, there was an increase in software expense associated with retail operations as the Company continues to enhance the customer retail experience. 
 
 General and Administrative Expense 
 
 General and administrative expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 81.9 million, an increase of 47.4 million, or 137.7 , from 34.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily from legislative campaign contributions totaling 48.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 0.5 million for the same period in 2023. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 28.3 million, an increase of 1.4 million, or 5.1 , from 27.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, Net of Recoveries 
 
 Impairment and disposal of long-lived assets, net of recoveries was a gain of 4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a gain of 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily due to insurance recoveries received, partially offset by asset disposal activities. 
 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 
 Interest expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 17.5 million, a decrease of 3.4 million , or 16.2 , from 20.8 million for three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily the result of debt retirements of 57.0 million in September 2023 and 130.0 million in December 2023 which lowered interest expense in the third quarter of 2024. This favorability was partially offset by the change in the fair value of our interest rate swap liability in the current period and interest expense associated with a 25.0 million mortgage note executed in December 2023.

 Revenue 
 
 Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 885.3 million, an increase of 43.1 million, or 5.1 , from 842.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a 33.6 million increase in retail revenue and a 10.0 million increase in wholesale revenue. 
 
 The increase in retail revenue was partially driven by the opening of additional dispensaries; the Company operated 215 dispensaries as of September 30, 2024, compared to 188 as of September 30, 2023. Additionally, Maryland became an adult-use market in July 2023 providing a full nine months of adult-use revenue for 2024 in comparison to 2023. 
 
 The increase in wholesale revenue was primarily driven by Maryland adult-use sales starting in July 2023 which drove an increase in the year-to-date 2024 period compared to the same period in 2023.

Cost of goods as a percentage of revenues was 40.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 48.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

The change was primarily due to 2023 asset disposal activities associated with underperforming assets where 2024 included insurance recoveries received associated with property damage in 2023, which was partially offset by impairment charges related to assets moved to held for sale. Impairment of Goodwill 
 
 Impairment of goodwill was zero for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 307.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, based on the results of the Company's goodwill impairment procedures, the Company recorded a 307.6 million goodwill impairment for its single reporting unit. 
 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 
 Interest expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 47.6 million, a decrease of 13.3 million, or 21.9 , from 60.9 million for nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily the result of debt retirements with 57.0 million of debt retired in September 2023 and 130.0 million of debt retired in December 2023 driving lower interest expense in the first nine months of 2024. This favorability was partially offset by interest associated with the 25.0 million mortgage note executed in December 2023. 
 
 Interest Income Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 11.5 million, an increase of 7.2 million, or 166.0 , from 4.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to an increase in funds invested in high-yield money market fund accounts and short-term certificates of deposit compared to the same prior year period. 
 
 Gain on Debt Extinguishment 
 
 Gain on debt extinguishment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was zero compared to 8.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In 2023, the Company repurchased senior secured notes at a 16.5 discount to par which resulted in a 8.2 million gain on extinguishment. 
 
 Other (Expense) Income, Net 
 
 Other expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 4.8 million, a change of 10.7 million, from other income, net of 5.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily a result of the provision for credit losses recorded on non-operating notes receivable in the current year, compared to gains recognized on sales of non-operating assets in the prior year. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 
 The provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 150.0 million, an increase of 44.1 million, or 41.6 , from 105.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The provision for income taxes as a percentage of gross profit was 28.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 24.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in tax expense for 2024 was driven by an increase in gross profit for the period, the one-time impact of changing certain state tax filing methods which requires us to revalue deferred taxes in those states, and an increase in interest expense on uncertain tax positions.

 Management's Use of Non-GAAP Measures 
 
 Our management uses a financial measure that is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or GAAP, in addition to financial measures in accordance with GAAP to evaluate our operating results. This non-GAAP financial measure should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, our reported financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that is not defined under GAAP. Our management uses this non-GAAP financial measure and believes it enhances an investor s understanding of our financial and operating performance from period to period because it excludes certain material non-cash items and certain other adjustments management believes are not reflective of our ongoing operations and performance. Adjusted EBITDA adjusts the following items from net income: interest expense, interest income, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization to arrive at EBITDA. This is then adjusted for items that we do not believe represent the operations of the core business such as acquisition, transaction and other non-recurring costs including major system changes as well as contributions to specific initiatives (e.g., contributions to Smart Safe Florida), impairments and disposals of long-lived assets including goodwill, discontinued operations, share-based compensation, gain on debt extinguishment, and other income and expense items. 
 
 We report Adjusted EBITDA to help investors assess the operating performance of the Company s business. The financial measure noted above is a metrics that has been adjusted from the GAAP net income measure in an effort to provide readers with a normalized metric in making comparisons more meaningful across the cannabis industry, as well as to remove non-recurring, irregular and one-time items that may otherwise distort the GAAP net income measure. 
 
 As noted above, our Adjusted EBITDA is not prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of Adjusted EBITDA rather than net income, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Because of these limitations, we consider, and you should consider, Adjusted EBITDA together with other operating and financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA, has been included herein immediately following our discussion of Adjusted EBITDA .

 Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 96.1 million, an increase of 18.3 million, or 23.6 , from 77.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily resulted from increased revenue and improved gross profit. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 308.8 million, an increase of 74.3 million, or 31.7 , from 234.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily resulted from increased revenue and improved gross profit. 
 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of GAAP net loss to non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, for each of the periods presented:

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 
 Since our inception, we have funded our operations and capital spending through cash flows from product sales, third-party debt, proceeds from the sale of our capital stock and loans from affiliates and entities controlled by our affiliates. We are generating cash from operations and are deploying our capital reserves to acquire and develop assets capable of producing additional revenues to support our business growth. Ou r current principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents provided by our operations as well as debt and equity offerings. The Company has and expects to generate additional cash from operations, due in part to the Company's position that it does not owe taxes attributable to the application of Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code. Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks and money market funds. 
 
 33 

Table of Contents 

 Our primary uses of cash are for working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service payments, and income tax payments. Add itionally, we may use cash to support cannabis market expansion related initiatives, such as Smart Safe Florida. Working capital is used principally for personnel expenses as well as costs related to the cultivation, processing and distribution of our products. Our capital expenditures consist primarily of additional cultivation and processing facilities and retail dispensaries, and improvements to existing facilities to support the long-term growth in markets with adult-use catalysts. In the current period, our debt service payments consist primarily of interest payments. 
 
 We may also use capital for other investing and financing activities. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company invested 80.0 million into certificates of deposit that classify as short-term investments due to their original maturity dates. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were 237.7 million and short-term investments were 80.2 million . We believe our existing cash balances and short-term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements from the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q through at least the next 12 months. Any additional future requirements would likely be funded through the following sources of capital: 
 
 Cash from ongoing operations, 
 Equity or debt financings. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 The condensed consolidated statements of cash flows include continuing operations and discontinued operations. The table below highlights our cash flows for the periods presented: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities 
 240,809 70,377 Net cash used in investing activities 
 (183,434) (30,308) Net cash used in financing activities 
 (27,082) (60,599) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 
 30,293 (20,530) 
 
 Cash Flows - Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 240.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 170.4 million as compared to 70.4 million net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. T his improvement was primarily due to the reduction in net tax payments of 159.9 million, primarily related to the impact from the Company's position that it does not owe taxes attributable to the application of Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code (inclu sive of 52.4 million in refunds received from amended returns based on this position) and a 94.0 million improvement in gross profit driven by higher revenues and improved gross margin, which was only partially offset by the comparative change in inventories of 74.8 million and a 43.1 million increase in payments for legislative campaign contributions. Operating cash flows in the comparative period benefited from the 66.5 million decrease in inventories versus the 8.3 million increase for the current period.

Cash Flows - Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 183.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 153.1 million, compared to the 30.3 million net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily reflects the Company's 80.0 million investment into certificates of deposit, higher current year purchases of property, plant and equipment and internal use software to support the long-term growth of the business. 
 
 Cash Flows - Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 27.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 33.5 million, compared to 60.6 million net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven from the payment made in the comparative period on the open market repurchase of 57,000 of the Company's USD 1,000 senior secured notes, due October 6, 2026, for a purchase price of 47.6 million, excluding fees and accrued interest. This was partially offset by payments made in the current period for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards and the consolidated VIE settlement transaction and the related costs incurred. 

Balance Sheet Exposure 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 100 of our condensed consolidated balance sheets is exposed to U.S. cannabis-related activities, and substantially all our revenue is from U.S. cannabis operations. We believe our operations are in material compliance with all applicable state and local laws, regulations, and licensing requirements in the states in which we operate. However, cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law. For information about risks related to U.S. cannabis operations, please refer to the Risk Factors section of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and "Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors" in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 
 For information on our commitments for financing arrangements, operating leases, claims and litigation, contingencies, and other obligations, see Note 3. Supplementary Financial Information, Note 4. Financing Arrangements, and Note 6. Income Taxes in Part I. Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Other than the 203.8 million increase in our uncertain tax position liabilities and the 39.4 million and 11.8 million increase in our future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating and finance leases, there were no other material changes to our contractual obligations as set forth in Part II Item 7 of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of the date of this filing, we do not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on the results of operations or financial condition of, including, and without limitation, such considerations as liquidity and capital resources. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 There have been no material changes to our market risk disclosures as set forth in Part II Item 7A of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the risk related to controls and procedures. 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 Management of the Company, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of September 30, 2024. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, due to the material weaknesses as described in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which are currently in the process of being remediated, as of September 30, 2024, we did not maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures because of the material weaknesses in internal control as described in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024. 
 Notwithstanding the material weaknesses described in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have concluded that the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly state, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP. 
 Management s Remediation Measures 
 
 We previously identified and disclosed material weaknesses in internal control as described in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024. The material weaknesses were due to a lack of sufficient controls around information technology and inventory valuat ion. Management is committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment. In response to the identified material weaknesses, management, with the oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, has taken a number of remediation actions during the year ending December 31, 2023, and continues to address these deficiencies in 2024. The Company will not be able to conclude that the material weaknesses are remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through formal testing, that the controls are operating effectively. Remediation actions taken include the following: 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 Information Technology: 
 The Company continued to strengthen the design and implementation of logical access, change management, and IT operation controls. Initiatives include segregation of duties evaluation, monitoring control implementation, and user access review optimization. 
 The Company procured IT subject matter experts to enhance role permissions and segregation of duties within financially relevant systems, as well as, reduced the number of privileged access users who can make program and job changes. The Company also created an Identity and Access Management team within Information Security to strengthen the management of user provisioning to financial data. 
 The Company implemented a formal management training program designed to educate and enforce appropriate documentation for system access, change management, and user access reviews. 
 Inventory Valuation: 
 The Company hired additional resources with the knowledge and experience to design and execute review control procedures to identify potential errors or misstatements in a manual and complex inventory valuation process including: 
 Additions to our cost accounting team with appropriate technical knowledge to support inventory accounting requirements; 
 
 A leadership resource to lead internal controls efforts; and 
 
 External resources to assist management with remediation efforts such as formalizing accounting procedures, identifying key review steps and analysis, validating key reports and spreadsheets, documenting management review, and additional training to inventory and accounting personnel. 
 
 The Company created a robust management review control process to assess the accuracy and reasonableness of inventory valuation by: 
 
 Documenting steps taken by management to perform the review, assess reasonableness, and investigate matters; 
 
 Applying the appropriate level of precision and defined criteria to drive review and investigative procedures; 
 
 Evidencing the performance of each management review activity prescribed in the control; and 
 
 Validating the completeness and accuracy of key reports and spreadsheets used in inventory valuation controls. 
 Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Other than the ongoing remediation measures discussed above, there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) which occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
