These forward-looking statements are necessarily estimates reflecting the best judgment of our senior management and involve a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which may be beyond our control. These risks and uncertainties, including those disclosed under Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on September 27, 2023, and in our other filings with the SEC, could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements and include, without limitation: The condition of the economy in general and of the cinema and/or cinema equipment industry in particular, Our customers adjustments in their order levels, Seasonality in our business, specifically our second fiscal quarter which is traditionally weaker, Changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors or suppliers, The addition or termination of key supplier relationships, The rate of introduction and acceptance by our customers of new products and services, Our ability to compete effectively with our current and future competitors, Our ability to enter into and renew key relationships with our customers and vendors, Changes in foreign currency exchange rates, A major disruption of our information technology infrastructure, Unforeseen catastrophic events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, armed conflict, terrorism, fires, typhoons and earthquakes, A lack of entertainment content caused by entertainment content provider labor disputes, strikes and work shutdowns, and

 Any other disruptions, such as labor shortages, unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements in this Report. Also, forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date of this Report. You should read this Report and the documents that we have filed as exhibits, completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this Report speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Except as required by law, we disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements publicly, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward- looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future. All forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing cautionary statements. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Report. Overview We are a leading provider of technology, products, and services to movie theater operators and sports and entertainment venues. 1) We provide a set of valuable services to movie theater operators and other critical screening and viewing rooms. These services include overall project management, which can encompass a wide range of design, integration, installation, and procurement services for new auditorium builds, refurbishments, or upgrades to existing facilities. 2) We design and manufacture a set of proprietary products that are sold either as part of our project management services or a la carte. Examples of these products include our ADA-compliant accessibility products and our Caddy brand, a leading provider of proprietary cup holders, trays, and other products sold into our strategic markets of motion picture exhibition, entertainment, and sports venues as well as other non-strategic markets. We also resell third-party technologies, including but not limited to items such as screens, projectors, and servers. 3) We resell third-party products as part of our project management services or a la carte. These include technology products such as screens, projectors, servers, and FF E (furniture, fixtures, and equipment). 4) Finally, we have a set of recently introduced products that we believe have the potential to be disruptive to the movie theater, entertainment and sports venue industries. For example, our operations enhancement and theater management solution include a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform combined with other technologies that allow theater operators to improve their quality control. We have also developed a translator product and service that will enable moviegoers to watch a movie in any language that the film is available in, all in the same auditorium through a set of augmented reality glasses. Another example is a proprietary mobile cart we ve developed to enable eSports and gaming in movie-theater auditoriums. 
 Factors affecting our performance Effect of COVID-19 global pandemic . The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the world and the movie exhibition industry. The social and economic effects have been widespread. At various points during the pandemic, authorities around the world-imposed measures intended to control the spread of COVID-19, including stay-at-home orders and restrictions on large public gatherings, which caused movie theaters in countries around the world to temporarily close. The repercussions of the COVID-19 global pandemic resulted in a significant impact on our customers, specifically those in the entertainment and cinema industries. As a result, the Company implemented various cash preservation strategies, including, but not limited to, temporary personnel and salary reductions, halting non-essential operating and capital expenditures, and negotiating modified timing and/or abatement of contractual payments with landlords and other major suppliers. Throughout 2020 and 2021 the theatres reopened as soon as local restrictions and the status of the COVID-19 pandemic would allow. As of September 30, 2024, a large majority of domestic and international theatres were open. The industry s recovery to historical levels of new film content, both in terms of the number of new films and box office performance, is still underway, as the 

 19 

Table of Contents 
 industry recovers from the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, evolving theatrical release windows, competition from streaming and other delivery platforms, supply chain delays, inflationary pressures, labor shortages, wage rate pressures and other economic factors. Based on our current estimates of recovery, we believe we have, and will generate, sufficient cash to sustain operations. Nonetheless, the COVID-19 pandemic and SAG-AFTRA strike has had, and continues to have, adverse effects on the Company s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Investment in growth . Based on 2024 losses, we will selectively invest in expanding our operations. We expect our total operating expenses to decrease in the foreseeable future to meet our revenue and cost control objectives. We plan to invest in our sales and support operations to support our new product initiatives and budget goals. Adding New Customers and Expanding Sales to Our Existing Customer Base . We intend to target new customers by selectively investing in our field sales force. We also intend to continue to target large customers organizations who have yet to use our products and services. A typical initial order involves educating prospective customers about the technical merits and capabilities and potential cost savings of our products and services as compared to our competitors products. We believe that customer references have been, and will continue to be, an important factor in winning new business. We expect that a substantial portion of our future sales will be sales to existing customers, including expansion of their product and service offerings, as we offer new products and services through the existing sales channel. Our business and results of operations will depend on our ability to continue to add new customers and sell additional products and services to our growing base of customers. Promoting Our Brand and Offering Additional Products . Our future performance will depend on our continued ability to achieve brand recognition for our proprietary line of products. We plan to increase our marketing expenditures to continue to create and maintain prominent brand awareness. Also, our future performance will depend on our ability to continue to offer high quality, high performance and high functionality products and services. We intend to continue to devote efforts to introduce new products and services including new versions of our existing product lines. We expect that our results of operations will be impacted by the timing, size and level of success of these brand awareness and product and service offering efforts. Ability to Maintain Gross Margins . Our gross margins have been and are expected to continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including competition, the timing of changes in pricing, shipment volumes, new product introductions, changes in product mixes, changes in our purchase price of components and assembly and test service costs and inventory write downs, if any. Our goal is to strive to maintain gross profits for products that may have a declining average selling price by continuing to focus on increased sales volume and looking to reduce operating costs. Decreases in average selling prices are primarily driven by competition and by reduced demand for products that face potential or actual technological obsolescence. We also focus on managing our inventory to reduce our overall exposure to price erosion. In addition, we seek to introduce new products and services with higher gross margins to offset the potential effect of price erosion on other lines of products. For example, we have recently productized and began marketing a new system which combines full compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act with a multi-language capability we expect this system will have higher margins than a substantial number of existing products we offer. In addition, we expect our offerings of Direct View LED screens to also carry significantly higher margins. Fluctuations in Revenues and Earnings . Both the sales cycle and the contract fulfillment cycle are dependent on a number of factors from our customers that are not in our control. Accordingly, backlog, the conversion of backlog into revenue and related earnings may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on our customers particular requirements, which can sometimes change between the initial signing of a contract and its ultimate fulfillment. Cost of goods sold Cost of goods sold includes the cost of products or components that we purchase from third party manufacturers plus assembly and packaging labor costs for these third parties or in-house designed products. Cost of goods sold is also affected by inventory obsolescence if our inventory management is not effective or efficient. We mitigate the risk of inventory obsolescence by stocking relatively small amounts of inventory at any given time, except for periodic strategic purchases, and relying instead on a strategy of manufacturing or acquiring products based on orders placed by our customers.

Liquidity and Capital Resources During the past several years, we have primarily met our working capital and capital resource needs from our operating cash flows and financing activities. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity, including cash and operating cash flow, will be sufficient to fund our operations and to meet our projected capital needs for a period of at least 12 months from the date the condensed consolidated financial statements are available to be issued. On July 7, 2021, the Company completed an initial public offering resulting in net proceeds of approximately 12.360 million. Cash balance at September 30, 2024 was approximately 5.246 million, as compared to 5.278 million at June 30, 2024. On August 8, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized salary reductions of 100,000 for the CEO from 250,000 to 150,000 and salary reductions for the Executive VP, Operations, Executive VP, Sales and Marketing from 234,000 to 212,000, respectively and the CFO from 220,000 to 200,000. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Compared to September 30, 2023, net cash used by operating activities increased by 0.175 million in September 30, 2024 due to cost reductions and lower inventory levels. Net cash used by operating activities was (0.032) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to (0.180) million in working capital decreases along with (0.025) million in net losses

 and offset by 0.173 million in other non-cash expenses. Within working capital change, the cash used of (0.818) million included declines in payables, customer deposits and lease liabilities offset by 0.638M in provision for receivables, inventory, prepaids, accrued expense and unearned warranty revenue. Net cash used in operating activities was (0.207) million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to (0.735) million in working capital declines offset by the 0.439 million in net income and 0.090 million in other non-cash expenses. The net change in other working capital was primarily due to increases in receivables, inventory and payables and decreases in customer deposits, offset by decreases in prepaid and accrued expenses. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was zero for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Net cash used in investing activities was (0.001) million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, for equipment purchases. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was zero for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified under the rules and forms of the SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. As required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive) and Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer and principal accounting officer) carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in paragraph (e) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) were not effective at September 30, 2024 due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as described below. Prior to the completion of our IPO in July 2021, we had been a private company with limited accounting personnel and other resources to address our internal control over financial reporting. During the course of preparing our consolidated financial statements for the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we determined that we had material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting relating to our financial reporting processes relating to (i) the design and operation of our closing and financial reporting process, (ii) the fact that we had no formal or documented accounting policies or procedures, (iii) the fact that certain segregation of duties issues existed and (iv) the fact that there was no formal review process around journal entries recorded. To improve internal controls, and starting with the three months ended September 30, 2024 and continuing since, Management updates month end close checklists, has implemented more segregation of duties among its limited accounting staff and the CFO formally approves month end journal entries. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are not party to any material pending legal proceedings. From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS There have been no material changes to the risk factors reported in Item 1A in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities None. ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES Not applicable.

In the event that the Corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to the stockholders of the Corporation.

Notice of any meeting need not be given to any stockholder who shall, either before or after the meeting, submit a waiver of notice or who shall attend such meeting, except when the stockholder attends for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Any stockholder so waiving notice of the meeting shall be bound by the proceedings of the meeting in all respects as if due notice thereof had been given.

If, however, such quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, either the chairman of the meeting, or the holders of a majority of the shares of stock entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice, other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, a notice 
 2 

of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after the adjournment a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board of Directors shall fix as the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record as of the record date so fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting. Section 9. Vote Required . When a quorum is present at any meeting, the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the matter shall decide any matter brought before such meeting, other than the election of directors, unless a different or minimum vote is required by the certificate of incorporation, these bylaws, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation, or any law or regulation applicable to the Corporation or its securities, in which case such different or minimum vote shall be the applicable vote on the matter. Section 10. Voting Power; Proxies . Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, each stockholder shall at every meeting of the stockholders be entitled to one (1) vote, in person or by proxy, for each share of the capital stock having voting power held by such stockholder in the manner prescribed by the Corporation s certificate of incorporation, in person or by proxy authorized by an instrument in writing or by a transmission permitted by law, including Rule 14a-19 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). No stockholder of the Corporation shall be entitled to exercise any right of cumulative voting. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or, if permitted by the Corporation s certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. Such authorization may be in a writing executed by the stockholder or his or her authorized officer, director, employee, or agent. To the extent permitted by law, a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for him or her as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of an electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization, or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that the electronic transmission either sets forth or is submitted with information from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder. A copy, facsimile transmission, or other reliable reproduction of the proxy authorized by this Section 10 may be substituted for or used in lieu of the original writing or electronic transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or electronic transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile transmission, or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or electronic transmission. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy that is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by delivering to the Secretary a revocation of the proxy or a new proxy bearing a later date. Any stockholder directly or indirectly soliciting proxies from other stockholders must use a proxy card color other than white, which shall be reserved for the exclusive use by the Board of Directors. Section 11. Conduct of Meetings . The date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be announced at the meeting by the person presiding over the meeting. The Board of Directors may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board of Directors, the person presiding over any meeting of stockholders shall have the right and authority to convene and (for any or no reason) to recess and/or adjourn the meeting, to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such presiding person, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the presiding person of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (iii) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the presiding person of the meeting shall determine; (iv) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (v) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants. The presiding person at any meeting of stockholders, in addition to making any other determinations that may be appropriate to the conduct of the meeting, shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a matter or business was not properly brought before the meeting and if such presiding person should so determine, such presiding person shall so declare to the meeting and any such matter or business not properly brought 
 3 

before the meeting shall not be transacted or considered. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors or the person presiding over the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure. Section 12. Fixing Record Date . (a) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall, unless otherwise required by law, not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting. If the Board of Directors so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the Board of Directors determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such determination. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided , however , that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote in accordance herewith at the adjourned meeting. (b) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall not be more than sixty (60) days prior to such action. If no such record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. (c) Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation, in order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. If no record date for determining stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting is fixed by the Board of Directors (i) when no prior action of the Board of Directors is required by law, the record date for such purpose shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation in accordance with applicable law, and (ii) if prior action by the Board of Directors is required by law, the record date for such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action. Section 13. Action Without Meeting . Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such stockholders.

Section 2 . Indemnification . The Corporation shall, to the fullest extent authorized under the laws of the State of Delaware, as those laws may be amended and supplemented from time to time, indemnify, advance expenses, and hold harmless any person (a Covered Person who was or is s or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether criminal, civil, administrative or investigative (a Proceeding ), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person for whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including attorneys fees) reasonably incurred by such Covered Person. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except for claims for indemnification (following the final disposition of such Proceeding) or advancement of expenses not paid in full, the Corporation shall be required to indemnify a Covered Person in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such Covered Person only if the commencement of such Proceeding (or part thereof) by the Covered Person was authorized in the specific case by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any Proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law (or other applicable law) for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (or of its full board of directors, its directors who are not parties to the Proceeding with respect to which indemnification is claimed, its stockholders, or independent legal counsel) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL (or other applicable law), nor an actual determination by any such person or persons that such claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to such action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. Section 5. Non-Exclusivity of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses . The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the certificate of incorporation, the bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such person s official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of the Corporation that indemnification of the Covered Persons shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law. The provisions of this Article shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any person who is not specified as a Covered Person, but whom the Corporation has the power or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the DGCL, or otherwise. The Corporation is specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts with any or all of its directors, officers, employees or agents respecting indemnification and advances, to the fullest extent not prohibited by the DGCL, or by any other applicable law. Section 6. Insurance . To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL or any other applicable law, the Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Covered Person against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person s status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article. Section 7 Amendment . Any amendment, repeal or modification of this Article VIII shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification. ARTICLE IX AMENDMENTS In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by the laws of the State of Delaware, the Board of Directors shall have the power to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the bylaws. The affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of Directors then in office shall be required to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the bylaws.
