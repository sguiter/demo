READY CAPITAL CORPORATION 
 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

and of the operating partnership, respectively. The Company, as sole general partner of the 
 operating partnership, has responsibility and discretion in the management and control of the operating partnership, and 
 the limited partners of the operating partnership, in such capacity, have no authority to transact business for, or 
 participate in the management activities of the operating partnership. Therefore, the Company consolidates the operating 
 partnership. 
 Acquisitions 
 Funding Circle. On July 1, 2024, the Company acquired Funding Circle USA, Inc. Funding Circle through its 
 subsidiary, iBusiness Funding LLC, for approximately million in cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities 
 (the Funding Circle Acquisition ). Funding Circle is an online lending platform that originates and services small 
 business loans. The Funding Circle Acquisition integrates Funding Circle s loan origination servicing platform with the 
 Company s Lending as a Service ("LaaS") and LenderAI product offerings. Refer to Note 5 for assets acquired and 
 liabilities assumed in the merger. 
 Madison One. On June 5, 2024, the Company acquired Madison One Capital, M1 CUSO and Madison One Lender 
 Services (together, Madison One ), a leading originator and servicer of United States Department of Agriculture 
 USDA and SBA guaranteed loan products, for an initial purchase price of approximately million paid in cash 
 (the Madison One Acquisition ). Approximately million of the initial purchase price was paid as bonuses to 
 certain key Madison One personnel in cash. Additional purchase price payments, including cash payments and the 
 issuance of shares of common stock of the Company, may be made over the following the acquisition date 
 contingent upon the Madison One business achieving certain performance metrics. Part of the Company s strategy in 
 acquiring Madison One included the value of the anticipated synergies arising from the acquisition and the value of the 
 acquired assembled workforce, neither of which qualify for recognition as an intangible asset. Refer to Note 5 for assets 
 acquired and liabilities assumed in the merger. 
 Broadmark. On May 31, 2023, the Company, Broadmark Realty Capital Inc., a Maryland corporation Broadmark ), 
 and RCC Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of the operating 
 partnership RCC Merger Sub ), completed a merger (such transaction, the Broadmark Merger in which Broadmark 
 merged with and into RCC Merger Sub, with RCC Merger Sub remaining as a wholly owned subsidiary of the operating 
 partnership. 
 At the effective time of the Broadmark Merger (the Effective Time ), each share of common stock, par value 
 per share, of Broadmark (the Broadmark Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective 
 Time (excluding any shares held by the Company, RCC Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries) was

(the Exchange Ratio 
 shares of its common stock, par value common stock ). No fractional shares of common stock were issued in 
 the Broadmark Merger, and the value of any fractional interests to which a former holder of Broadmark Common Stock 
 was otherwise entitled was paid in cash. In addition, RCC Merger Sub assumed Broadmark s outstanding senior 
 unsecured notes. 
 Each award of performance restricted stock units (each a Broadmark Performance RSU Award granted by Broadmark 
 under its 2019 Stock Incentive Plan (the Broadmark Equity Plan ), as of the Effective Time, was automatically 
 cancelled in exchange for the right to receive a number of shares of common stock equal to the product of (i) the number 
 of shares of Broadmark Common Stock subject to such Broadmark Performance RSU Award based on the achievement 
 of the applicable performance metric measured as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio 
 (rounded to the nearest whole share). 
 Each award of restricted stock units that was not a Broadmark Performance RSU Award granted pursuant to the 
 Broadmark Equity Plan (each a Broadmark RSU Award was assumed by the Company and converted into an award 
 of restricted stock units with respect to a number of shares of common stock, equal to the product of (i) the total number 
 of shares of Broadmark Common Stock subject to such Broadmark RSU Award as of immediately prior to the Effective 
 Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest whole share), on the same terms and conditions as were 
 applicable to such Broadmark RSU Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. 
 Each holder of a warrant (whether designated as public warrants, private warrants or otherwise) representing the right to 
 purchase shares of Broadmark Common Stock (each a Broadmark Warrant had the right to exercise such Broadmark 
 Warrant at any time prior to the Effective Time in exchange for Broadmark Common Stock, in accordance with, and 
 subject to, the terms and conditions of the agreement governing such Broadmark Warrant. Following the Effective Time, 
 each Broadmark Warrant that was outstanding as of the Effective Time was assumed by the Company and entitles each 
 holder thereof to receive, upon exercise of such assumed Broadmark Warrant, a number of shares of common stock 
 equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Broadmark Common Stock that such holder would have been

 Interest rate swap agreements. An interest rate swap is an agreement between two counterparties to exchange periodic 
 interest payments where one party to the contract makes a fixed-rate payment in exchange for a floating-rate payment 
 from the other party. The dollar amount each party pays is an agreed-upon periodic interest rate multiplied by a pre- 
 determined dollar principal (notional amount). No principal (notional amount) is exchanged between the two parties at 
 the trade initiation date and only interest payments are exchanged over the life of the contract. The fair value adjustments 
 are reported within net unrealized gain (loss) on financial instruments, while the related interest income or interest 
 expense are reported within net realized gain (loss) on financial instruments in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 Interest rate swaps are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
 FX forwards. FX forwards are agreements between two counterparties to exchange a pair of currencies at a set rate on a 
 future date. Such contracts are used to convert the foreign currency risk to U.S. dollars to mitigate exposure to 
 fluctuations in FX rates. The fair value adjustments are reported within net unrealized gain (loss) on financial 
 instruments in the consolidated statements of operations. FX forwards are classified as Level 2 in the fair value 
 hierarchy. 
 Hedge accounting. As a general rule, hedge accounting is permitted where the Company is exposed to a particular risk, 
 such as interest rate risk, that causes changes in the fair value of an asset or liability or variability in the expected future 
 cash flows of an existing asset, liability, or forecasted transaction that may affect earnings. 
 To qualify as an accounting hedge under the hedge accounting rules (versus an economic hedge where hedge accounting 
 is not applied), a hedging relationship must be highly effective in offsetting the risk designated as being hedged. Cash 
 flow hedges are used to hedge the exposure to the variability in cash flows from forecasted transactions, including the 
 anticipated issuance of securitized debt obligations. ASC 815 requires that a forecasted transaction be identified as 
 either: 1) a single transaction, or 2) a group of individual transactions that share the same risk exposures for which they 
 are designated as being hedged. Hedges of forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges since the price is not 
 fixed, hence involve variability of cash flows. 
 For qualifying cash flow hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative (the hedging instrument) is recorded in 
 other comprehensive income (loss) OCI and is reclassified out of OCI and into the consolidated statements of 
 operations when the hedged cash flows affect earnings. These amounts are recognized consistent with the classification 
 of the hedged item, primarily interest expense (for hedges of interest rate risk). If the hedge relationship is terminated, 
 then the value of the derivative recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) AOCI is recognized in 
 earnings when the cash flows that were hedged affect earnings, so long as the forecasted transaction remains probable of 
 occurring. 
 Hedge accounting is generally terminated at the debt issuance date because the Company is no longer exposed to cash 
 flow variability subsequent to issuance. Accumulated amounts recorded in AOCI at that date are then released to 
 earnings in future periods to reflect the difference in 1) the fixed rates economically locked in at the inception of the 
 hedge and 2) the actual fixed rates established in the debt instrument at issuance. Because of the effects of the time value 
 of money, the actual interest expense reported in earnings will not equal the effective yield locked in at hedge inception 
 multiplied by the par value. Similarly, this hedging strategy does not actually fix the interest payments associated with 
 the forecasted debt issuance.

Madison One Acquisition 
 On June 5, 2024 the Company acquired Madison One, a lending originator and servicer in the government guaranteed 
 loan industry focusing on USDA and SBA guaranteed loan products. Refer to Note 1 for more information about the 
 Madison One Acquisition. The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their 
 respective fair values. The methodologies used, and key assumptions made, to estimate the fair value of the assets 
 acquired and liabilities assumed are primarily based on future cash flows and discount rates.

In a business combination, the initial allocation of the purchase price is considered preliminary and therefore, is subject 
 to change until the end of the measurement period. The final determination occurred within one year of the merger date. 
 Because the measurement period for the Broadmark Merger remained open until May 31, 2024, certain fair value 
 estimates changed once all information necessary to make a final fair value assessment was received. The amounts 
 presented in the table above pertained to the preliminary purchase price allocation reported at the time of the Broadmark 
 Merger based on information that was available to management at the time the consolidated financial statements were 
 prepared. The preliminary purchase price allocation changed as the Company completed its analysis of the fair value of 
 the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which impacts the consolidated financial statements. Subsequent to the 
 determination of the preliminary purchase price allocation, the Company recorded a measurement period adjustment 
 based on the updated valuations obtained by decreasing net assets acquired and the total bargain purchase gain related to 
 this transaction by million .

In addition to delinquency rates, the current estimated LTV ratio, geographic distribution of the loan collateral and 
 collateral concentration are primary credit quality indicators that provide insight into a borrower s capacity and 
 willingness to meet its financial obligation. High LTV loans tend to have higher delinquency rates than loans where the 
 borrower has equity in the collateral. The geographic distribution of the loan collateral considers factors such as the 
 regional economy, property price changes and specific events such as natural disasters, which will affect credit quality. 
 The collateral concentration of the loan portfolio considers economic factors or events may have a more pronounced 
 impact on certain sectors or property types.

 a material impact on financial results. 
 Allowance for loan losses. The Company s allowance for loan losses reflects estimates of expected life-time loan losses, 
 which considers historical loan losses including losses from modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial 
 difficulty. The Company continues to estimate the allowance for loan losses after modification using loan-specific 
 inputs. As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 , substantially all of the modified loans were performing in 
 accordance with the modified contractual terms. 
 Loans with modifications disclosed in the previous twelve months are performing in accordance with their modified 
 terms as of September 30, 2024 , except for loan with a carrying value of million which did not make payments in 
 accordance with its modified terms during the three months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 On loans for which the Company determines foreclosure of the collateral is probable, expected losses are measured 
 based on the difference between the fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost basis of the loan as of the 
 measurement date. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company s total carrying amount of loans in 
 the foreclosure process was million and million , respectively.

of the lesser of the valuation excess and the discount amount, 
 divided by the number of initially issued CERs divided by the Company share value, with cash being paid in lieu of any 
 fractional shares of common stock otherwise due to such holder. In addition, each CER holder will be entitled to receive 
 a number of additional shares of common stock equal to (i) the amount of any dividends or other distributions paid with 
 respect to the number of whole shares of common stock received by such CER holder in respect of such holder s CERs 
 and having a record date on or after the closing of the Mosaic Mergers and a payment date prior to the issuance date of 
 such shares of common stock, divided by (ii) the Company share value. The probability-weighted expected return 
 method PWERM was utilized to estimate the return of capital and liquidation proceeds of the acquired asset 
 portfolio, considering each possible outcome, including the economic and projected performance of each acquired asset, 
 using a probability of - return of capital. The discounted cashflow technique was utilized by the Company to 
 assess the updated value of the acquired portfolio as of the revaluation date. The fair value of dividend distributions to 
 the CER holders was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model which considers various potential results based 
 on the CER payments, volatility of the Company s share value and projected dividend distributions. 
 The final purchase price allocation associated with the closing of the Mosaic Mergers valued the CERs at approximately 
 million or per CER. As of September 30, 2024 , the CERs were valued at . 
 In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may be categorized into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. 
 In such cases, an investment s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant 
 to the fair value measurement. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value 
 measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the investment.

 principal balance of the notes, in the event of a change in control or fundamental change pertaining to our company, as 
 defined in the applicable supplemental indentures. The notes rank equal in right of payment to any of its existing and 
 future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness; effectively junior in right of payment to any of its existing and future 
 secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all

 Securitization-related VIEs 
 Company sponsored securitizations. In a securitization transaction, assets are transferred to a trust, which generally 
 meets the definition of a VIE. The Company s primary securitization activity is in the form of LMM and SBA loan 
 securitizations, conducted through securitization trusts, which are typically consolidated, as the company is the primary 
 beneficiary. 
 As a result of the consolidation, the securitization is viewed as a loan financing to enable the creation of the senior 
 security and ultimately, sale to a third-party investor. As such, the senior security is presented in the consolidated balance 
 sheets as securitized debt obligations of consolidated VIEs. The third-party beneficial interest holders in the VIE have no 
 recourse against the Company, with the exception of an obligation to repurchase assets from the VIE in the event that 
 certain representations and warranties in relation to the loans sold to the VIE are breached. In the absence of such a 
 breach, the Company has no obligation to provide any other explicit or implicit support to any VIE. 
 The securitization trust receives principal and interest on the underlying loans and distributes those payments to the 
 certificate holders. The assets and other instruments held by the securitization trust are restricted in that they can only be 
 used to fulfill the obligations of the securitization trust. The risks associated with the Company s involvement with the 
 VIE is limited to the risks and rights as a certificate holder of the securities retained by the Company. 
 The consolidation of securitization transactions includes the senior securities issued to third parties which are shown as 
 securitized debt obligations of consolidated VIEs in the consolidated balance sheets.

The table above excludes non-company sponsored securitized debt obligations of million and million that are 
 included in the consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. 
 Repayment of securitized debt will be dependent upon the cash flows generated by the loans in the securitization trust 
 that collateralize such debt. The actual cash flows from the securitized loans are comprised of coupon interest, scheduled 
 principal payments, prepayments and liquidations of the underlying loans. The actual term of the securitized debt may 
 differ significantly from the Company s estimate given that actual interest collections, mortgage prepayments and/or 
 losses on liquidation of mortgages may differ significantly from those expected. 
 Third-party sponsored securitizations. For most third-party sponsored securitizations, the Company determined that it is 
 not the primary beneficiary because it does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the 
 economic performance of these entities. Specifically, the Company does not manage these entities or otherwise solely 
 hold decision making powers that are significant, which include special servicing decisions. As a result of this 
 assessment, the Company does not consolidate any of the underlying assets and liabilities of these trusts and only 
 accounts for its specific interests in them. 
 Unconsolidated VIEs 
 The Company does not consolidate variable interests held in an acquired joint venture investment accounted for as an 
 equity method investment as it does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their 
 economic performance and therefore, the Company only accounts for its specific interest in them.

The Management Agreement may be terminated upon the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the Company s 
 independent directors or the holders of a majority of the outstanding common stock (excluding shares held by employees 
 and affiliates of the Manager), based upon (1) unsatisfactory performance by the Manager that is materially detrimental 
 to the Company or (2) a determination that the management fee payable to the Manager is not fair, subject to the 
 Manager s right to prevent such a termination based on unfair fees by accepting a mutually acceptable reduction of 
 management fees agreed to by at least two-thirds of the Company s independent directors. The Manager must be 
 provided with written notice of any such termination at least days prior to the expiration of the then existing term. 
 Additionally, upon such a termination by the Company without cause (or upon termination by the Manager due to the 
 Company s material breach), the management agreement provides that the Company will pay the Manager a termination 
 fee equal to times the average annual base management fee earned by the Manager during the prior month 
 period immediately preceding the date of termination, calculated as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal 
 quarter prior to the date of termination, except upon an internalization. Additionally, if the management agreement is 
 terminated under circumstances in which the Company is obligated to make a termination payment to the Manager, the 
 operating partnership shall repurchase, concurrently with such termination, the Class A special unit for an amount equal 
 to times the average annual amount of the incentive distribution paid or payable in respect of the Class A special 
 unit during the month period immediately preceding such termination, calculated as of the end of the most recently 
 completed fiscal quarter before the date of termination. 
 The current term of the Management Agreement will expire on October 31, 2025 and is automatically renewed for 
 successive terms on each anniversary thereafter; provided, however, that either the Company, under the certain 
 limited circumstances described above that would require the Company and the operating partnership to make the 
 payments described above, or the Manager may terminate the Management Agreement annually upon days prior 
 notice. 
 Expense reimbursement . In addition to the management fees and incentive distribution described above, the Company 
 is also responsible for reimbursing the Manager for certain expenses paid by the Manager on behalf of the Company and

Stock incentive plans 
 The Company currently maintains the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan which authorize 
 the Compensation Committee of the Board to approve grants of equity-based awards to the Company s officers and 
 directors, and employees of the Manager and its affiliates. The 2013 Equity Incentive Plan provided for grants of equity- 
 based awards up to an aggregate of of the shares of the Company s common stock issued and outstanding from time 
 to time on a fully diluted basis. On August 22, 2023, the Company s stockholders approved the 2023 Equity Incentive 
 Plan which replaces the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan and provides for grants of equity-based awards up to million 
 shares of the Company s common stock. As of August 22, 2023, further awards will be granted under the 2013 
 Equity Incentive Plan, and the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan remains in effect only for so long as awards granted 
 thereunder remain outstanding. The Company currently settles stock-based incentive awards with newly issued shares. 
 The fair value of the RSUs and RSAs granted, which is generally determined based upon the stock price on the grant 
 date, is recorded as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting periods for the awards, with an 
 offsetting increase in stockholders equity. 
 In 2024 , 2023 , and 2022 , the Company granted , , and , respectively, of time-based RSAs under 
 the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan to certain key employees. These awards generally 
 vest ratably in equal annual installments over a period based solely on continued employment or service. The 
 Company further granted in these years , , and , respectively, of time-based RSAs and RSUs to 
 non-employee directors of the Company, which vest ratably in equal installments quarterly over a period. 
 Directors may elect to receive RSAs or RSUs that have a deferred settlement date of their choosing . Dividends are paid 
 on all RSA time-based awards and dividend equivalents are paid on deferred RSU awards during their deferral period. 
 Additionally, as part of the Broadmark Merger, the Company assumed the Broadmark RSU Awards outstanding 
 immediately prior to the Effective Time and converted them into Company RSUs after applying the Exchange 
 Ratio, of which Company RSUs remain outstanding. The Broadmark RSU Awards have the same terms and

 Performance-based equity awards under the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan 
 2024 performance-based RSUs. In February 2024, the Company granted, to certain key employees, 
 performance-based RSUs at a grant date fair value of per performance-based RSU. Subject to the pre-established 
 metrics achieved during the performance period, the actual number of shares that the key employees receive at the end of 
 the performance period remains at risk and subject to forfeiture. The fair value of the performance-based RSUs is 
 recorded as compensation expense over the performance period and will cliff vest at the end of the performance period, 
 with an offsetting increase in stockholders equity. 
 Performance-based equity awards under the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan 
 2023 performance-based RSUs. In June 2023, the Company granted, to certain key employees, performance- 
 based RSUs at a grant date fair value of per performance-based RSU, which may be earned based on the 
 achievement of performance goals by the end of 2024 in relation to the Broadmark Merger. The awards are allocated 
 to awards that may be earned based on cost savings in 2024 as a percentage of the pre-merger Broadmark expense 
 run rate, to awards that may be earned based on the volume of Broadmark product originated from the time of the 
 merger through the end of 2024, to awards that may be earned based on the generation of incremental liquidity 
 from asset level financing, portfolio run-off, sales or corporate re-levering through the end of 2024, and to awards 
 that may be earned based on distributable return on equity ROE for 2024. Subject to the level of achievement of 
 these goals during the performance period, the actual number of shares that the key employees receive may range from 
 to of the target award. The fair value of the performance-based RSUs granted is recorded as compensation 
 expense over the performance period and will vest 2/3rds on December 31, 2024, and 1/3rd on December 31, 2025, with 
 an offsetting increase in stockholders equity. Any awards earned on December 31, 2024 based on achievement of the 
 applicable performance metrics but vesting on December 31, 2025 will convert into RSAs that are eligible to vest on 
 December 31, 2025 based on the key employee s continued employment or service through that date. 
 In February 2023, the Company granted, to certain key employees, performance-based RSUs at a grant date fair 
 value of per performance-based RSU. The performance-based RSUs are allocated to awards that may be 
 earned based on achievement of performance goals related to distributable ROE for the forward-looking

to awards that may be earned based on achievement of performance goals 
 related to relative TSR for such forward-looking performance period relative to the performance of a 
 designated peer group. Subject to the distributable ROE metric and relative TSR achieved during the performance 
 period, the actual number of shares that the key employees receive at the end of the performance period may range from 
 to of the target award. The fair value of the performance-based RSUs is recorded as compensation expense 
 over the performance period and will cliff vest at the end of the performance period, with an offsetting 
 increase in stockholders equity. 
 2022 performance-based RSUs. In February 2022, the Company granted, to certain key employees, 
 performance-based RSUs at a grant date fair value of per performance-based RSU. During April 2024, 
 performance-based RSUs were forfeited. The performance-based RSUs are allocated to awards that may be earned 
 based on achievement of performance goals related to distributable ROE for the forward-looking period 
 ending December 31, 2024 and to awards that may be earned based on achievement of performance goals related to 
 relative TSR for such forward-looking performance period relative to the performance of a designated peer 
 group. Subject to the distributable ROE metric and relative TSR achieved during the vesting period, the actual number of 
 shares that the key employees receive at the end of the performance period may range from to of the target 
 award. The fair value of the performance-based RSUs is recorded as compensation expense over the performance period 
 and will cliff vest at the end of a performance period, with an offsetting increase in stockholders equity. 
 2021 performance-based RSUs. In February 2021, the Company granted, to certain key employees, 
 performance-based RSUs at a grant date fair value of per performance-based RSU. During October 2021, 
 performance-based RSUs were forfeited. The performance-based RSUs are allocated to awards that may be earned 
 based on achievement of performance goals related to absolute TSR for the forward-looking period ending 
 December 31, 2023 and to awards that may be earned based on achievement of performance goals related to TSR 
 for such forward-looking performance period relative to the performance of a designated peer group. Subject 
 to the absolute and relative TSR achieved during the performance period, the actual number of shares that the key 
 employees receive at the end of the performance period may range from to of the target award. Following the 
 conclusion of the performance period on December 31, 2023, the Board determined that the relative TSR target goal was 
 achieved and the absolute TSR goal was not achieved. As such, on January 9, 2024 the Board approved the settlement of 
 performance-based RSUs. The fair value of the performance-based RSUs granted was recorded as compensation 
 expense over the performance period with an offsetting increase in stockholders equity. 
 Preferred Stock 
 In the event of a liquidation or dissolution of the Company, any outstanding preferred stock ranks senior to the 
 outstanding common stock with respect to payment of dividends and the distribution of assets. 
 The Company classifies Series C Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, or Series C Preferred Stock, on the balance 
 sheets using the guidance in ASC 480 10 S99. The Series C Preferred Stock contains certain fundamental change 
 provisions that allow the holder to redeem the preferred stock for cash only if certain events occur, such as a change in 
 control. As of September 30, 2024 , the conversion rate was shares of common stock per principal amount of 
 the Series C Preferred Stock, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share of common 
 stock. As redemption under these circumstances is not solely within the Company s control, the Series C Preferred Stock 
 has been classified as temporary equity. The Company has analyzed whether the conversion features should be 
 bifurcated under the guidance in ASC 815 and has determined that bifurcation is not necessary. 

E 

In the table above, 
 Shareholders are entitled to receive dividends, when and as authorized by the Board, out of funds legally 
 available for the payment of dividends. Dividends for Series C Preferred Stock are payable quarterly on the 

59 

million and million on its Series C Preferred Stock and Series E 
 Preferred Stock, respectively, duri ng the three months ended September 30, 2024 . The dividends were paid on 
 October 15, 2024 for Series C Preferred Stock and on October 31, 2024 for Series E Preferred Stock to the 
 holders of record as of the close of business on September 30, 2024 . 
 The Company may, at its option, redeem the Series E Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at any time and from 
 time to time, for cash at a redemption price equal to of the liquidation preference of per share, 
 plus accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, to the redemption date. Series E Preferred Stock is not redeemable 
 prior to June 10, 2026, except under certain conditions. 
 Public and Private Warrants 
 As part of the Broadmark Merger, the Company assumed public and private placement warrants that represented the 
 right to purchase shares of Broadmark Common Stock. As of September 30, 2024 , there were million public 
 warrants outstanding, each representing the right to purchase shares of our common stock, and million 
 private placement warrants outstanding, each representing the right to purchase shares of common stock. In the 
 aggregate, the Company has outstanding warrants to purchase approximately million shares of common stock at a 
 price of per whole share. Settlement of outstanding warrants will be in shares of common stock, unless the 
 Company elects (solely in the Company s discretion) to settle warrants the Company has called for redemption in cash, 
 and subject to customary adjustment in the event of business combinations and certain tender offers. Unless earlier 
 redeemed, the public warrants will expire on November 19, 2024. 
 The liability for the private placement warrants was less than million as of September 30, 2024 and is included in 
 accounts payable and other accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. 
 Equity ATM Program 
 On July 9, 2021, the Company entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement, as amended on March 8, 2022 (the 
 Equity Distribution Agreement ), with JMP Securities LLC (the Sales Agent ), pursuant to which the Company may 
 sell, from time to time, shares of the Company s common stock, par value per share, having an aggregate 
 offering price of up to million , through the Sales Agent either as agent or principal (the Equity ATM Program ). 
 The Company made such sales through the Equity ATM Program during the three or nine months ended

 Certain investors own OP units in the operating partnership. An OP unit and a share of common stock of the Company 
 have substantially the same economic characteristics in as much as they effectively share equally in the net income or 
 loss of the operating partnership. OP unit holders have the right to redeem their OP units, subject to certain restrictions. 
 The redemption is required to be satisfied in shares of common stock or cash at the Company s option, calculated as 
 follows: share of the Company s common stock, or cash equal to the fair value of a share of the Company s common 
 stock at the time of redemption, for each OP unit. When an OP unit holder redeems an OP unit, non-controlling interests 
 in the operating partnership is reduced and the Company s equity is increased. As of September 30, 2024 and

of 
 its net taxable income, subject to certain adjustments and excluding any net capital gain, in order for U.S. federal income 
 tax not to apply to earnings that are distributed. To the extent the Company satisfies this distribution requirement but 
 distributes less than of its net taxable income, it will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its undistributed 
 taxable income. In addition, the Company will be subject to a nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount paid to 
 stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under U.S. federal tax laws. Even if the 
 Company qualifies as a REIT, it may be subject to certain U.S. federal income and excise taxes and state and local taxes 
 on its income and assets. If the Company fails to maintain its qualification as a REIT for any taxable year, it may be 
 subject to material penalties as well as federal, state and local income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates 
 and it would not be able to qualify as a REIT for the subsequent four taxable years. As of September 30, 2024 and 
 December 31, 2023 , the Company was in compliance with all REIT requirements. 
 Certain subsidiaries have elected to be treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries TRSs ). TRSs permit the Company to 
 participate in certain activities that would not be qualifying income if earned directly by the parent REIT, as long as 
 these activities meet specific criteria, are conducted within the parameters of certain limitations established by the 
 Internal Revenue Code and are conducted in entities which elect to be treated as taxable subsidiaries under the Internal 
 Revenue Code. To the extent these criteria are met, the Company will continue to maintain our qualification as a REIT. 
 The Company s TRSs engage in various real estate - related operations, including originating and securitizing 
 commercial mortgage loans, and investments in real property. Such TRSs are not consolidated for federal income tax 
 purposes but are instead taxed as corporations. For financial reporting purposes, a provision for current and deferred 
 income taxes is established for the portion of earnings recognized by the Company with respect to its interest in TRSs. 
 The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences arising from differences 
 between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities under GAAP and their respective tax bases. The Company 
 evaluates its deferred tax assets for recoverability using a consistent approach which considers the relative impact of 
 negative and positive evidence, including historical profitability and projections of future taxable income. 
 The provisions of ASC 740 require that carrying amounts of deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if, 
 based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be 
 realized. As of December 31, 2023, the Company recorded net deferred tax assets of million as a result of the 
 acquisition of Broadmark taxable REIT subsidiary. A full valuation allowance was recorded against these deferred tax 
 assets at year-end as it was more likely than not that these assets would not be realized. In the first quarter of 2024, the 
 Company completed a reorganization which will allow the Company to recover the deferred tax assets recorded, and as 
 such, the valuation allowance was released in the first quarter. There was no valuation allowance recorded for the three 
 months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 The Company s framework for assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires it to weigh all available 
 evidence, including the sustainability of recent profitability required to realize the deferred tax assets, the cumulative net 
 income in its consolidated statements of operations in recent years, the future reversals of existing taxable temporary 
 differences, and the carryforward periods for any carryforwards of net operating losses.

 loan program types. The segments are based on this organizational structure and the information reviewed by the CODM 
 and management to evaluate segment results.

 Overview 
 
 Our Business 
 We are a multi-strategy real estate finance company that originates, acquires, finances, and services LMM loans, SBA 
 loans, construction loans and, to a lesser extent, MBS collateralized primarily by LMM loans, or other real estate-related 
 investments. Our loans generally range in original principal amounts up to 40 million and are used by businesses to 
 purchase real estate used in their operations or by investors seeking to acquire multi-family, office, retail, mixed use or 
 warehouse properties. Our objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders primarily through 
 dividends, as well as through capital appreciation. In order to achieve this objective, we continue to grow our investment 
 portfolio and believe that the breadth of our full-service real estate finance platform will allow us to adapt to market 
 conditions and deploy capital in our asset classes and segments with the most attractive risk-adjusted returns. 
 Our Residential Mortgage Banking segment meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale and presented as a 
 discontinued operation. For all periods presented, the operating results for these operations have been removed from 
 continuing operations. The MD A has been adjusted to exclude discontinued operations unless otherwise noted. We 
 report our activities in the following two operating segments: 
 LMM Commercial Real Estate. We originate LMM loans across the full life-cycle of an LMM property 
 including construction, bridge, stabilized and agency loan origination channels through our subsidiary, 
 ReadyCap Commercial. These originated loans are generally held-for-investment or placed into 
 securitization structures. As part of this segment, we originate and service multi-family loan products under 

72 

the Freddie Mac SBL program. These originated loans are held for sale, and subsequently sold to Freddie 
 Mac. We provide construction and permanent financing for the preservation and construction of affordable 
 housing, primarily utilizing tax-exempt bonds through Red Stone, a subsidiary. In addition, we acquire 
 LMM loans as part of our business strategy. We hold performing LMM loans to term and seek to maximize 
 the value of the non-performing LMM loans acquired by us through borrower-based resolution strategies. 
 We typically acquire non-performing loans at a discount to their unpaid principal balance UPB when we 
 believe that resolution of the loans will provide attractive risk-adjusted returns. 
 Small Business Lending. We acquire, originate and service owner-occupied loans guaranteed by the SBA 
 under the SBA Section 7(a) Program and government guaranteed loans focused on the USDA through our 
 subsidiary, ReadyCap Lending. We hold an SBA license as one of only 17 non-bank Small Business 
 Lending Companies and have been granted preferred lender status by the SBA. These originated loans are 
 either held-for-investment, placed into securitization structures, or sold . 
 We are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a REIT under the Code. To qualify as a REIT, we are required 
 to annually distribute substantially all of our net taxable income, excluding capital gain, to stockholders. To the extent 
 that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain, or distribute at least 90 , but less than 100 , of our REIT taxable 
 income, as adjusted, we will be required to pay U.S. federal corporate income tax on the undistributed income. We are 
 organized in a traditional UpREIT format pursuant to which we serve as the general partner of, and conduct substantially 
 all of our business through, our operating partnership. We also intend to operate our business in a manner that will 
 permit us to be excluded from registration as an investment company under the 1940 Act. 
 For additional information on our business, refer to Part I, Item 1, Business in our Form 10-K. 
 
 Acquisitions 
 Funding Circle. On July 1, 2024, the Company acquired Funding Circle through its subsidiary, iBusiness Funding LLC, 
 for approximately 41.2 million in cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities (the Funding Circle Acquisition ). 
 Funding Circle is an online lending platform that originates and services small business loans. The Funding Circle 
 Acquisition integrates Funding Circle s loan origination servicing platform with the Company s Lending as a Service 
 ("LaaS") and LenderAI product offerings. Refer to Notes 1 and 5, included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements, of 
 this Form 10-Q, for more information about the Funding Circle Acquisition and the assets acquired and liabilities 
 assumed as a result of the Funding Circle Acquisition. 
 Madison One. On June 5, 2024, the Company acquired Madison One Capital, M1 CUSO and Madison One Lender 
 Services (together, Madison One ), a leading originator and servicer of USDA and SBA guaranteed loan products, for 
 an initial purchase price of approximately 32.9 million paid in cash (the Madison One Acquisition ). Approximately 
 3.6 million of the initial purchase price was paid as bonuses to certain key Madison One personnel in cash. Additional 
 purchase price payments, including cash payments and the issuance of shares of common stock of the Company, may be 
 made over the four years following the acquisition date contingent upon the Madison One business achieving certain 
 performance metrics. Part of the Company s strategy in acquiring Madison One included the value of the anticipated 
 synergies arising from the acquisition and the value of the acquired assembled workforce, neither of which qualify for 
 recognition as an intangible asset. Refer to Notes 1 and 5, included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements, of this Form 
 10-Q, for more information about the Madison One Acquisition and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a 
 result of the Madison One Acquisition. 
 Broadmark. On May 31, 2023, the Company, Broadmark Realty Capital Inc., a Maryland corporation Broadmark ), 
 and RCC Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of the operating 
 partnership RCC Merger Sub ), completed a merger (such transaction, the Broadmark Merger in which Broadmark 
 merged with and into RCC Merger Sub, with RCC Merger Sub remaining as a wholly owned subsidiary of the operating 
 partnership. As a result of the Broadmark Merger, the number of directors on the Company's board of directors (the 
 Board increased by three members, from nine to twelve, with the three additional directors each having served on the 
 board of directors of Broadmark immediately prior to the effective time of the Broadmark Merger. The Broadmark 
 Merger further diversified our business by expanding on our residential and commercial construction lending platforms. 

73 

Refer to Notes 1 and 5, included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements, of this Form 10-Q, for more information about 
 the Broadmark Merger and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of the Broadmark Merger. 
 
 Factors Impacting Operating Results 
 We expect that our results of operations will be affected by a number of factors and will primarily depend on the level of 
 interest income from our assets, the market and fair value of our assets and the supply of, and demand for, LMM loans, 
 SBA loans, USDA loans, construction loans, MBS and other assets we may acquire in the future, demand for housing, 
 population trends, construction costs, the availability of alternative real estate financing from other lenders, changes in 
 credit spreads, and the financing and other costs associated with our business. These factors may have an impact on our 
 ability to originate new loans or the performance of our existing loan portfolio. Our net investment income, which 
 includes the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of purchase discounts, varies primarily as a result of 
 changes in market interest rates, the rate at which our distressed assets are liquidated and the prepayment speed of our 
 performing assets. Interest rates and prepayment speeds vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the 
 financial markets, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. Our operating 
 results may also be impacted by our available borrowing capacity, conditions in the financial markets, credit losses in 
 excess of initial estimates or unanticipated credit events experienced by borrowers whose loans are held directly by us or 
 are included in our MBS. Difficult market conditions as well as inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues, health 
 epidemics and outbreaks of contagious diseases, unemployment and the availability and cost of credit are factors which 
 could also impact our operating results. For additional information about certain risks we face, including market risk, 
 credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, off-balance sheet risk and prepayment risk, refer to Note 23, included in Part 
 I, Item 1, Financial Statements, and Part I, Item 3, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, of 
 this Form 10-Q, as well as Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 . 
 Changes in Market Interest Rates. We own and expect to acquire or originate fixed rate mortgages and floating rate 
 mortgages with maturities ranging from two to 30 years. Our loans typically have amortization periods of 15 to 30 years 
 or balloon payments due in two to 10 years. Fixed rate mortgage loans bear interest that is fixed for the term of the loan 
 and we typically utilize derivative financial and hedging instruments in an effort to hedge the interest rate risk associated 
 with such fixed rate mortgages. As of September 30, 2024 , all fixed rate loans are match funded in securitization. 
 Floating rate mortgage loans generally have an adjustable interest rate equal to the sum of a fixed spread plus an index 
 rate, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), which typically resets monthly. As of September 30, 
 2024 , approximately 83 of the loans in our portfolio were floating rate mortgages, and 17 were fixed rate mortgages, 
 based on UPB. 
 Current market conditions. During t he third quarter, macroeconomic concerns persisted including uncertainty about the 
 commercial real estate sector, inflationary pressures, elevated interest rates, and geopolitical tensions. In an effort to ease 
 borrowing costs and restore price stability, there has been a shift towards a less aggressive monetary policy by the U.S. 
 Federal Reserve . Although the full impact of these changes remains uncertain and difficult to predict, concerns and 
 uncertainties about the economic outlook may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash 
 flows. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 
 Key Financial Measures and Indicators 
 As a real estate finance company, we believe the key financial measures and indicators for our business are earnings per 
 share, dividends declared per share, distributable earnings, return on equity, and net book value per share. As further 
 described below, distributable earnings is a measure that is not prepared in accordance with GAAP. We use distributable 
 earnings to evaluate our performance and determine dividends, excluding the effects of certain transactions and GAAP 
 adjustments that we believe are not necessarily indicative of our current loan activity and operations. Refer to Non- 
 GAAP Financial Measures below for a reconciliation of net income to distributable earnings.

 Our Loan Pipeline 
 We have a large and active pipeline of potential acquisition and origination opportunities that are in various stages of our 
 investment process. We refer to assets as being part of our acquisition or origination pipeline if (i) an asset or portfolio 
 opportunity has been presented to us and we have determined, after a preliminary analysis, that the assets fit within our 
 investment strategy and exhibit the appropriate risk/reward characteristics (ii) in the case of acquired loans, we have 
 executed a non-disclosure agreement NDA or an exclusivity agreement and commenced the due diligence process or 
 we have executed more definitive documentation, such as a letter of intent LOI and (iii) in the case of originated 
 loans, we have issued an LOI, and the borrower has paid a deposit. 
 We operate in a competitive market for investment opportunities and competition may limit our ability to originate or 
 acquire the potential investments in the pipeline. The consummation of any of the potential loans in the pipeline depends 
 upon, among other things, one or more of the following: available capital and liquidity, our Manager s allocation policy, 
 satisfactory completion of our due diligence investigation and investment process, approval of our Manager s Investment 
 Committee, market conditions, our agreement with the seller on the terms and structure of such potential loan, and the 
 execution and delivery of satisfactory transaction documentation. Historically, we have acquired less than a majority of 
 the assets in our pipeline at any one time and there can be no assurance the assets currently in our pipeline will be 
 acquired or originated by us in the future. 
 The table below presents information on our investment portfolio originations and acquisitions (based on fully 
 committed amounts).

 Non-GAAP financial measures 
 We believe that providing investors with distributable earnings, formerly referred to as core earnings, gives investors 
 greater transparency into the information used by management in our financial and operational decision-making, 
 including the determination of dividends. 
 We calculate distributable earnings as GAAP net income (loss) excluding the following: 
 i) any unrealized gains or losses on certain MBS not retained by us as part of our loan origination businesses 
 ii) any realized gains or losses on sales of certain MBS 
 iii) any unrealized gains or losses on Residential MSRs from discontinued operations 
 iv) any unrealized change in current expected credit loss reserve and valuation allowances 
 v) any unrealized gains or losses on de-designated cash flow hedges 
 vi) any unrealized gains or losses on foreign exchange hedges 
 vii) any unrealized gains or losses on certain unconsolidated joint ventures 
 viii) any non-cash compensation expense related to stock-based incentive plan 
 ix) one-time non-recurring gains or losses, such as gains or losses on discontinued operations, bargain 
 purchase gains, or merger related expenses 
 In calculating distributable earnings, net income (in accordance with GAAP) is adjusted to exclude unrealized gains and 
 losses on MBS acquired by us in the secondary market but is not adjusted to exclude unrealized gains and losses on 
 MBS retained by us as part of our loan origination businesses, where we transfer originated loans into an MBS 
 securitization and retain an interest in the securitization. In calculating distributable earnings, we do not adjust net 
 income (in accordance with GAAP) to take into account unrealized gains and losses on MBS retained by us as part of 
 our loan origination businesses because we consider the unrealized gains and losses that are generated in the loan 
 origination and securitization process to be a fundamental part of this business and an indicator of the ongoing 

80 

performance and credit quality of our historical loan originations. In calculating distributable earnings, net income (in 
 accordance with GAAP) is adjusted to exclude realized gains and losses on certain MBS securities due to a variety of 
 reasons which may include collateral type, duration, and size. 
 In addition, in calculating distributable earnings, net income (in accordance with GAAP) is adjusted to exclude 
 unrealized gains or losses on residential MSRs, held at fair value from discontinued operations. Servicing rights relating 
 to our small business commercial business are accounted for under ASC 860, Transfer and Servicing. In calculating 
 distributable earnings, we do not exclude realized gains or losses on commercial MSRs, as servicing income is a 
 fundamental part of our business and an indicator of the ongoing performance. 
 Furthermore, we believe it is useful to present distributable earnings before realized losses on certain investments, such 
 as charge-offs and losses realized on sales of real estate owned assets and LMM loans, to reflect our direct operating 
 results. We utilize distributable earnings before realized losses as an additional performance metric to consider when 
 assessing our ability to declare and pay dividends. Distributable earnings and distributable earnings before realized 
 losses are non-U.S. GAAP financial measures and because these non-U.S. GAAP measures are incomplete measures of 
 our financial performance and involve differences from net income computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, they 
 should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, our net income as measures of our financial performance. In 
 addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentations of distributable earnings and 
 distributable earnings before realized losses may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures of other 
 companies. 
 To qualify as a REIT, we must distribute to our stockholders each calendar year dividends equal to at least 90 of our 
 REIT taxable income (including certain items of non-cash income), determined without regard to the deduction for 
 dividends paid and excluding net capital gain. There are certain items, including net income generated from the creation 
 of MSRs, that are included in distributable earnings but are not included in the calculation of the current year s taxable 
 income. These differences may result in certain items that are recognized in the current period s calculation of 
 distributable earnings not being included in taxable income, and thus not subject to the REIT dividend distribution 
 requirement, until future years.

 Incentive distribution payable to our Manager 
 Under the partnership agreement of our operating partnership, our Manager, the holder of the Class A special unit in our 
 operating partnership, is entitled to receive an incentive distribution, distributed quarterly in arrears in an amount, not 
 less than zero, equal to the difference between (i) the product of (A) 15 and (B) the difference between (x) IFCE (as 
 described below) of our operating partnership, on a rolling four-quarter basis and before the incentive distribution for the 

82 

current quarter, and (y) the product of (1) the weighted average of the issue price per share of common stock or operating 
 partnership unit OP unit (without double counting) in all of our offerings multiplied by the weighted average number 
 of shares of common stock outstanding (including any restricted shares of common stock and any other shares of 
 common stock underlying awards granted under our 2013 Equity Incentive Plan, our 2023 Equity Incentive Plan and the 
 Broadmark Equity Plan) and OP units (without double counting) in such quarter and (2) 8 , and (ii) the sum of any 
 incentive distribution paid to our Manager with respect to the first three quarters of such previous four quarters; 
 provided, however, that no incentive distribution is payable with respect to any calendar quarter unless cumulative IFCE 
 is greater than zero for the most recently completed 12 calendar quarters. 
 The incentive distribution shall be calculated within 30 days after the end of each quarter and such calculation shall 
 promptly be delivered to our Company. We are obligated to pay the incentive distribution 50 in cash and 50 in either 
 common stock or OP units, as determined in our discretion, within five business days after delivery to our Company of 
 the written statement from the holder of the Class A special unit setting forth the computation of the incentive 
 distribution for such quarter. Subject to certain exceptions, our Manager may not sell or otherwise dispose of any portion 
 of the incentive distribution issued to it in common stock or OP units until after the three-year anniversary of the date 
 that such shares of common stock or OP units were issued to our Manager. The price of shares of our common stock for 
 purposes of determining the number of shares payable as part of the incentive distribution is the closing price of such 
 shares on the last trading day prior to the approval by our Board of the incentive distribution. 
 For purposes of determining the incentive distribution payable to the Manager, incentive fee core earnings IFCE is 
 defined under the partnership agreement of the operating partnership as GAAP net income (loss) of the operating 
 partnership excluding non-cash equity compensation expense, the expenses incurred in connection with the operating 
 partnership's formation or continuation, the incentive distribution, real estate depreciation and amortization (to the extent 
 that the Company forecloses on any properties underlying its assets) and any unrealized gains, losses, or other non-cash 
 items recorded in the period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in 
 net income. The amount will be adjusted to exclude one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain other non- 
 cash charges after discussions between the Manager and the Company s independent directors and after approval by a 
 majority of the independent directors. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity is a measure of our ability to turn non-cash assets into cash and to meet potential cash requirements. We use 
 significant cash to purchase LMM loans and other target assets, originate new LMM loans, pay dividends, repay 
 principal and interest on our borrowings, fund our operations and meet other general business needs. Certain of our loans 
 pay PIK interest rather than cash interest payments and from time to time, we may grant concessions to borrowers 
 experiencing significant financial difficulties in the form of modified terms such as interest rate reductions and other 
 terms described elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. These factors may increase our reliance on our primary sources of 
 liquidity, including our existing cash balances, borrowings, including securitizations, re-securitizations, repurchase 
 agreements, warehouse facilities, bank credit facilities and other financing agreements (including term loans and 
 revolving facilities), the net proceeds of offerings of equity and debt securities, including our senior secured notes, 
 corporate debt, and net cash provided by operating activities. 
 We are continuing to monitor the impact of rising interest rates, credit spreads and inflation on the Company, the 
 borrowers underlying our real estate-related assets, the tenants in the properties we own, our financing sources, and the 
 economy as a whole. Because the severity, magnitude and duration of these economic events remain uncertain, rapidly 
 changing and difficult to predict, the impact on our operations and liquidity also remains uncertain and difficult to 
 predict . 
 
 Cash flow 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 . Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 , decreased by 26.9 
 million to 235.6 million from December 31, 2023 , primarily due to net cash used for financing activities, partially offset 
 by net cash provided by investing and operating activities. T he net cash used for financing activities primarily reflected 
 repayments of securitized debt obligations of consolidated VIEs and repayments of secured borrowings. The net cash 
 provided by investing activities primarily reflected proceeds on disposition and principal payments of loans, partially 
 offset by net cash used for loan originations. The net cash provided by operating activities reflected sales on loans, held 

83 

for sale and a valuation allowance related to the transfer of loans, net to loans, held for sale, partially offset by an 
 increase in operating assets and net loss from continuing operations. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 . C ash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2023 , increased by 17.1 
 million to 290.7 million from December 31, 2022 , primarily due to net cash provided by investing and operating 
 activities, partially offset by net cash used for financing activities. The net cash provided by investing activities primarily 
 reflected proceeds from dispositions and paydowns, partially offset by loan originations. The net cash provided by 
 operating activities reflected net income, partially offset by a bargain purchase gain in connection with the Broadmark 
 Merger. The net cash used for financing activities primarily reflected the repayments of secured borrowings, Paycheck 
 Protection Program Liquidity Facility PPPLF borrowings and the convertible note, partially offset by proceeds from 
 secured borrowings and net proceeds from the issuance of securitized debt obligations of consolidated VIEs. 
 Financing Strategy and Leverage 
 In addition to raising capital through offerings of our public equity and debt securities, we finance our investment 
 portfolio through securitization and secured borrowings. We generally seek to match-fund our investments to minimize 
 the differences in the terms of our investments and our liabilities. Our secured borrowings have various recourse levels 
 including full recourse, partial recourse and non-recourse, as well as varied mark-to-market provisions including full 
 mark-to-market, credit mark only and non-mark-to-market. Securitizations allow us to match fund loans pledged as 
 collateral on a long-term, non-recourse basis. Securitization structures typically consist of trusts with principal and 
 interest collections allocated to senior debt and losses on liquidated loans to equity and subordinate tranches, and provide 
 debt equal to 50 to 90 of the cost basis of the assets. 
 We also finance originated SBL with secured borrowings until the loans are sold, generally within 30 days. 
 As of September 30, 2024 , we had a total leverage ratio of 3.3 x and recourse leverage ratio of 1.0 x. Our operating 
 segments have different levels of recourse debt according to the differentiated nature of each segment. Our LMM 
 Commercial Real Estate and Small Business Lending segments have recourse leverage ratios of 0.3x and 1.0x , 
 respectively. The remaining recourse leverage ratio is from our corporate debt offerings. 
 
 Secured Borrowings 
 Credit Facilities and Other Financing Agreements. We utilize credit facilities and other financing arrangements to 
 finance our business. The financings are collateralized by the underlying mortgages, assets, related documents, and 
 instruments, and typically contain index-based financing rate and terms, haircut and collateral posting provisions which 
 depend on the types of collateral and the counterparties involved. These agreements often contain customary negative 
 covenants and financial covenants, including maintenance of minimum liquidity, minimum tangible net worth, 
 maximum debt to net worth ratio and current ratio and limitations on capital expenditures, indebtedness, distributions, 
 transactions with affiliates and maintenance of positive net income. 
 The table below presents certain characteristics of our credit facilities and other financing arrangements.

 Repurchase Agreements. Under the loan repurchase facilities and securities repurchase agreements, we may be required 
 to pledge additional assets to our counterparties in the event that the estimated fair value of the existing pledged 

84 

collateral under such agreements declines and such lenders demand additional collateral, which may take the form of 
 additional assets or cash. Generally, the loan repurchase facilities and securities repurchase agreements contain a SOFR- 
 based financing rate, term and haircuts depending on the types of collateral and the counterparties involved. The loan 
 repurchase facilities also include financial maintenance covenants. 
 If the estimated fair values of the assets increase due to changes in market interest rates or other market factors, lenders 
 may release collateral back to us. Margin calls may result from a decline in the value of the investments securing the 
 loan repurchase facilities and securities repurchase agreements, prepayments on the loans securing such investments and 
 from changes in the estimated fair value of such investments generally due to principal reduction of such investments 
 from scheduled amortization and resulting from changes in market interest rates and other market factors. Counterparties 
 also may choose to increase haircuts based on credit evaluations of our Company and/or the performance of the assets in 
 question. Historically, disruptions in the financial and credit markets have resulted in increased volatility in these levels, 
 and this volatility could persist as market conditions continue to change. Should prepayment speeds on the mortgages 
 underlying our investments or market interest rates suddenly increase, margin calls on the loan repurchase facilities and 
 securities repurchase agreements could result, causing an adverse change in our liquidity position. To date, we have 
 satisfied all of our margin calls and have never sold assets in response to any margin call under these borrowings. 
 Our borrowings under repurchase agreements are renewable at the discretion of our lenders and, as such, our ability to 
 roll-over such borrowings are not guaranteed. The terms of the repurchase transaction borrowings under our repurchase 
 agreements generally conform to the terms in the standard master repurchase agreement as published by the Securities 
 Industry and Financial Markets Association, as to repayment, margin requirements and the segregation of all assets we 
 have initially sold under the repurchase transaction. In addition, each lender typically requires that we include 
 supplemental terms and conditions to the standard master repurchase agreement. Typical supplemental terms and 
 conditions, which differ by lender, may include changes to the margin maintenance requirements, required haircuts and 
 purchase price maintenance requirements, requirements that all controversies related to the repurchase agreement be 
 litigated in a particular jurisdiction, and cross default and setoff provisions. 
 We maintain certain assets, which, from time to time, may include cash, unpledged LMM loans, LMM ABS and short- 
 term investments (which may be subject to various haircuts if pledged as collateral to meet margin requirements) and 
 collateral in excess of margin requirements held by our counterparties, or collectively, the Cushion , to meet routine 
 margin calls and protect against unforeseen reductions in our borrowing capabilities. Our ability to meet future margin 
 calls will be impacted by the Cushion, which varies based on the fair value of our investments, our cash position and 
 margin requirements. Our cash position fluctuates based on the timing of our operating, investing and financing activities 
 and is managed based on our anticipated cash needs.

ReadyCap Holdings 4.50 senior secured notes due 2026. On October 20, 2021, ReadyCap Holdings, an indirect 
 subsidiary of the Company, completed the offer and sale of 350.0 million of its 4.50 Senior Secured Notes due 2026 
 (the Senior Secured Notes ). The Senior Secured Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company, each 
 direct parent entity of ReadyCap Holdings, and other direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Company from time to time 
 that is a direct parent entity of Sutherland Asset III, LLC or otherwise pledges collateral to secure the Senior Secured 
 Notes (collectively, the SSN Guarantors ). 
 ReadyCap Holdings and the SSN Guarantors respective obligations under the Senior Secured Notes are secured by a 
 perfected first-priority lien on certain capital stock and assets (collectively, the SSN Collateral owned by certain 
 subsidiaries of the Company. 
 The Senior Secured Notes are redeemable by ReadyCap Holdings following a non-call period, through the payment of 
 the outstanding principal balance of the Senior Secured Notes plus a make-whole or other premium that decreases the 
 closer the Senior Secured Notes are to maturity. ReadyCap Holdings is required to offer to repurchase the Senior 
 Secured Notes at 101 of the principal balance of the Senior Secured Notes in the event of a change in control and a 
 downgrade of the rating on the Senior Secured Notes in connection therewith, as set forth more fully in the note purchase 
 agreement. 
 The Senior Secured Notes were issued pursuant to a note purchase agreement, which contains certain customary negative 
 covenants and requirements relating to the collateral and our company, ReadyCap Holdings, and the SSN Guarantors, 
 including maintenance of minimum liquidity, minimum tangible net worth, maximum debt to net worth ratio and 
 limitations on transactions with affiliates. 
 Ready Term Holdings, LLC Ready Term Holdings term loan due 2029. On April 12, 2024, Ready Term Holdings, 
 an indirect subsidiary of the Company, entered into a credit agreement which provides for a delayed draw term loan to 
 the Company in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed 115.25 million (the Term Loan ). The Term Loan is fully 
 and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company and other direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Company from time to 
 time that pledge collateral to secure the Term Loan (collectively, the Term Loan Guarantors ). 
 Ready Term Holdings and the Term Loan Guarantors respective obligations under the Term Loan are secured by a 
 perfected first-priority lien on certain capital stock and assets (collectively, the Term Loan Collateral owned by 
 certain subsidiaries of the Company. 
 The Term Loan matures on April 12, 2029, and may be drawn at any time on or prior to January 12, 2025, subject to the 
 satisfaction of customary conditions. The Company borrowed 75.0 million in connection with the initial closing of the 
 Term Loan. On August 19, 2024, the Company borrowed an additional 20.0 million. The Term Loan bears interest on 
 the outstanding principal amount thereof at a rate equal to (a) SOFR plus 5.50 per annum or (b) base rate plus 4.50 
 per annum; provided that if at any time the Term Loan is rated below investment grade, the interest rate shall increase to 
 (x) SOFR plus 6.50 per annum or (y) base rate plus 5.50 per annum until the rating is no longer below investment 
 grade. In connection with the entry into the credit agreement, the Company also agreed to pay certain upfront fees on the 
 initial borrowing date. The Company will also pay, with respect to any unused portion of the Term Loan, a commitment 
 fee of 1.00 per annum. 

87 

The Term Loan was issued pursuant to a credit agreement, which contains certain customary representations and 
 warranties and affirmative and negative covenants and requirements relating to the collateral and our Company, Ready 
 Term Holdings, and the Term Loan Guarantors, including maintenance of a minimum asset coverage ratio. 
 
 Corporate debt. 
 We issue senior unsecured notes in public and private transactions. The notes are governed by a base indenture and 
 supplemental indentures. Often, the notes are redeemable by us following a non-call period, through the payment of the 
 outstanding principal balance plus a make-whole or other premium that typically decreases the closer the notes are to 
 maturity. We are often required to offer to repurchase the notes, in some cases at 101 of the principal balance of the 
 notes, in the event of a change in control or fundamental change pertaining to our company, as defined in the applicable 
 supplemental indentures. The notes rank equal in right of payment to any of our existing and future unsecured and 
 unsubordinated indebtedness; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our existing and future secured 
 indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all existing and 
 future indebtedness, other liabilities (including trade payables) and (to the extent not held by us) preferred stock, if any, 
 of our subsidiaries. The supplemental indentures governing the notes often contain customary negative covenants and 
 financial covenants relating to maintenance of minimum liquidity, minimum tangible net worth, maximum debt to net 
 worth ratio and limitations on transactions with affiliates. 
 In addition, in connection with the Broadmark Merger, RCC Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of the operating 
 partnership, assumed Broadmark s obligations on certain senior unsecured notes. The note purchase agreement 
 governing these notes contains financial covenants that require compliance with leverage and coverage ratios and 
 maintenance of minimum tangible net worth, as well as other customary affirmative and negative covenants. 
 
 The Debt ATM Agreement 
 On May 20, 2021, the Company entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the Sales Agreement with B. 
 Riley Securities, Inc. (the Agent ), pursuant to which it may offer and sell, from time to time, up to 100.0 million of 
 the 6.20 2026 Notes and the 5.75 2026 Notes. Sales of the 6.20 2026 Notes and the 5.75 2026 Notes pursuant to 
 the Sales Agreement, if any, may be made in transactions that are deemed to be at the market offerings as defined in 
 Rule 415 under the Securities Act (the Debt ATM Program ). The Agent is not required to sell any specific number of 
 the notes, but the Agent will make all sales using commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and 
 sales practices on mutually agreed terms between the Agent and the Company. No such sales through the Debt ATM 
 Program were made during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or September 30, 2023 , respectively. 
 
 Securitization transactions 
 Our Manager s extensive experience in loan acquisition, origination, servicing and securitization strategies has enabled 
 us to complete several securitizations of LMM and SBA loan assets since January 2011. These securitizations allow us 
 to match fund the LMM and SBA loans on a long-term, non-recourse basis. The assets pledged as collateral for these 
 securitizations were contributed from our portfolio of assets. By contributing these LMM and SBA assets to the various 
 securitizations, these transactions created capacity for us to fund other investments.

 We used the proceeds from the sale of the tranches issued to purchase and originate LMM and SBA loans. We are the 
 primary beneficiary of all firm sponsored securitizations; therefore they are consolidated in our financial statements. 
 
 Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Other than the items referenced above, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations for the three 
 months ended September 30, 2024 . Refer to Item 7, "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
 Results of Operations Contractual Obligations," in the Company's Form 10-K for further details. As of the date of this 
 Form 10-Q, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements, other than as disclosed.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires the use of estimates and 
 assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial 
 statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We believe that all of the 
 decisions and assessments upon which our consolidated financial statements are based were reasonable at the time made, 
 based upon information available to us at that time. The following discussion describes the critical accounting estimates 
 that apply to our operations and require complex management judgment. This summary should be read in conjunction 
 with our accounting policies and use of estimates included in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 3 
 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in the 
 Company s Form 10-K. 

Allowance for credit losses 
 The allowance for credit losses consists of the allowance for losses on loans and lending commitments accounted for at 
 amortized cost. Such loans and lending commitments are reviewed quarterly considering credit quality indicators, 
 including probable and historical losses, collateral values, LTV ratio and economic conditions. The allowance for credit 
 losses increases through provisions charged to earnings and reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries. 
 We utilize loan loss forecasting models for estimating expected life-time credit losses, at the individual loan level, for its 
 loan portfolio. The Current Expected Credit Loss CECL forecasting methods used by the Company include (i) a 
 probability of default and loss given default method using underlying third-party CMBS/CRE loan database with 
 historical loan losses and (ii) probability weighted expected cash flow method, depending on the type of loan and the 
 availability of relevant historical market loan loss data. We might use other acceptable alternative approaches in the 
 future depending on, among other factors, the type of loan, underlying collateral, and availability of relevant historical 
 market loan loss data. 
 We estimate the CECL expected credit losses for our loan portfolio at the individual loan level. Significant inputs to our 
 forecasting methods include (i) key loan-specific inputs such as LTV, vintage year, loan-term, underlying property type, 
 occupancy, geographic location, and others, and (ii) a macro-economic forecast. These estimates may change in future 
 periods based on available future macro-economic data and might result in a material change in our future estimates of 
 expected credit losses for its loan portfolio. 
 In certain instances, we consider relevant loan-specific qualitative factors to certain loans to estimate its CECL expected 
 credit losses. We consider loan investments that are both (i) expected to be substantially repaid through the operation or 
 sale of the underlying collateral, and (ii) for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, to be collateral- 
 dependent loans. For such loans that we determine that foreclosure of the collateral is probable, we measure the 
 expected losses based on the difference between the fair value of the collateral (less costs to sell the asset if repayment is 
 expected through the sale of the collateral) and the amortized cost basis of the loan as of the measurement date. For 
 collateral-dependent loans that we determine foreclosure is not probable, we apply a practical expedient to estimate 
 expected losses using the difference between the collateral s fair value (less costs to sell the asset if repayment is 
 expected through the sale of the collateral) and the amortized cost basis of the loan. 
 While we have a formal methodology to determine the adequate and appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses, 
 estimates of inherent loan losses involve judgment and assumptions as to various factors, including current economic 
 conditions. Our determination of adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is based on quarterly evaluations of the 
 above factors. Accordingly, the provision for loan losses will vary from period to period based on management's ongoing 
 assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. 
 Significant judgment is required when evaluating loans for impairment; therefore, actual results over time could be 
 materially different. Refer to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 6 Loans and Allowance for Credit 
 Losses included in this Form 10-Q for results of our loan impairment evaluation . 

90 

Valuation of financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value 
 We measure our MBS, derivative assets and liabilities, and any assets or liabilities where we have elected the fair value 
 option at fair value, including certain loans we have originated that are expected to be sold to third parties or securitized 
 in the near term. 
 We have established valuation processes and procedures designed so that fair value measurements are appropriate and 
 reliable, that they are based on observable inputs where possible, that the valuation approaches are consistently applied, 
 and the assumptions and inputs are reasonable. We also have established processes to provide that the valuation 
 methodologies, techniques and approaches for investments that are categorized within Level 3 of the ASC 820 Fair 
 Value Measurement fair value hierarchy (the fair value hierarchy are fair, consistent and verifiable. Our processes 
 provide a framework that ensures the oversight of our fair value methodologies, techniques, validation procedures, and 
 results. 
 When actively quoted observable prices are not available, we either use implied pricing from similar assets and liabilities 
 or valuation models based on net present values of estimated future cash flows, adjusted as appropriate for liquidity, 
 credit, market and/or other risk factors. Refer to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7 Fair Value 
 Measurements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in the Form 10-K for a more 
 complete discussion of our critical accounting estimates as they pertain to fair value measurements. 
 
 Servicing rights impairment 
 Servicing rights, at amortized cost, are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently carried at amortized cost. 
 For purposes of testing our servicing rights, carried at amortized cost, for impairment, we first determine whether facts 
 and circumstances exist that would suggest the carrying value of the servicing asset is not recoverable. If so, we then 
 compare the net present value of servicing cash flow with its carrying value. The estimated net present value of servicing 
 cash flows of the intangibles is determined using discounted cash flow modeling techniques which require management 
 to make estimates regarding future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration historical and forecasted loan 
 prepayment rates, delinquency rates and anticipated maturity defaults. If the carrying value of the servicing rights 
 exceeds the net present value of servicing cash flows, the servicing rights are considered impaired and an impairment 
 loss is recognized in earnings for the amount by which carrying value exceeds the net present value of servicing cash 
 flows. We monitor the actual performance of our servicing rights by regularly comparing actual cash flow, credit, and 
 prepayment experience to modeled estimates. 
 Significant judgment is required when evaluating servicing rights for impairment therefore, actual results over time 
 could be materially different. Refer to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8 Servicing Rights included 
 in this Form 10-Q for a more complete discussion of our critical accounting estimates as they pertain to servicing rights 
 impairment. 
 Refer to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4 Recent Accounting Pronouncements included in Item 8, 
 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in the Company s Form 10-K for a discussion of recent accounting 
 developments and the expected impact to the Company. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 In the normal course of business, we enter into transactions in various financial instruments that expose us to various 
 types of risk, both on and off-balance sheet, which are associated with such financial instruments and markets for which 
 we invest. These financial instruments expose us to varying degrees of market risk, credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity 
 risk, off-balance sheet risk and prepayment risk. Many of these risks have been augmented due to the continuing 
 economic disruptions caused by inflationary pressures, rising energy costs, heightened geopolitical tensions, and the 
 impact of pandemics and epidemics which remain uncertain and difficult to predict. We continue to monitor the impact 
 and effect of these risks in our operations. 
 
 Market risk. Market risk is the potential adverse changes in the values of the financial instrument due to unfavorable 
 changes in the level or volatility of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, or market values of the underlying 

91 

financial instruments. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to market risk by entering into offsetting transactions, which 
 may include purchase or sale of interest-bearing securities and equity securities. 
 
 Credit risk. We are subject to credit risk in connection with our investments in LMM loans and LMM ABS and other 
 target assets we may acquire in the future. The credit risk related to these investments pertains to the ability and 
 willingness of the borrowers to pay, which is assessed before credit is granted or renewed and periodically reviewed 
 throughout the loan or security term. We believe that loan credit quality is primarily determined by the borrowers credit 
 profiles and loan characteristics. We seek to mitigate this risk by seeking to acquire assets at appropriate prices given 
 anticipated and unanticipated losses and by deploying a value-driven approach to underwriting and diligence, consistent 
 with our historical investment strategy, with a focus on projected cash flows and potential risks to cash flow. We further 
 mitigate our risk of potential losses while managing and servicing our loans by performing various workout and loss 
 mitigation strategies with delinquent borrowers. Nevertheless, unanticipated credit losses could occur which could 
 adversely impact operating results. 
 
 Interest rate risk. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, 
 domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control. 
 Our operating results will depend, in part, on differences between the income from our investments and our financing 
 costs. Our debt financing is based on a floating rate of interest calculated on a fixed spread over the relevant index, 
 subject to a floor, as determined by the particular financing arrangement. The general impact of changing interest rates is 
 discussed above under Factors Impacting Operating Results Changes in Market Interest Rates. In the event of a 
 significant rising interest rate environment and/or economic downturn, defaults could increase and result in credit losses 
 to us, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and 
 prospects. Furthermore, such defaults could have an adverse effect on the spread between our interest-earning assets and 
 interest-bearing liabilities. 
 Additionally, non-performing LMM loans are not as interest rate sensitive as performing loans, as earnings on non- 
 performing loans are often generated from restructuring the assets through loss mitigation strategies and 
 opportunistically disposing of them. Because non-performing LMM loans are short-term assets, the discount rates used 
 for valuation are based on short-term market interest rates, which may not move in tandem with long-term market 
 interest rates. 
 The table below projects the impact on our interest income and expense for the twelve-month period following 
 September 30, 2024 , assuming an immediate increase or decrease of 25, 50, 75, and 100 basis points in interest rates.

Such hypothetical impact of interest rates on our variable rate debt does not consider the effect of any change in overall 
 economic activity that could occur in a rising interest rate environment. Further, in the event of such a change in interest 
 rates, we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to such a change. However, due to the uncertainty of the 
 specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, this analysis assumes no changes in our financial 
 structure. 

92 

Liquidity risk. Liquidity risk arises in our investments and the general financing of our investing activities. It includes 
 the risk of not being able to fund acquisition and origination activities at settlement dates and/or liquidate positions in a 
 timely manner at a reasonable price, in addition to potential increases in collateral requirements during times of 
 heightened market volatility. It also includes risk stemming from PIK interest loans and loan modifications we may grant 
 to borrowers which are intended to minimize our economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. 
 Such modifications may include interest rate reductions, principal forgiveness, term extensions, and other-than- 
 insignificant payment delay, which may impact our ability to meet potential cash requirements and make us more reliant 
 on financing strategies. Additionally, i f we were forced to dispose of an illiquid investment at an inopportune time , we 
 might be forced to do so at a substantial discount to the market value, resulting in a realized loss. We attempt to mitigate 
 our liquidity risk by regularly monitoring the liquidity of our investments in LMM loans, ABS and other financial 
 instruments. Factors such as our expected exit strategy for, the bid to offer spread of, and the number of broker dealers 
 making an active market in a particular strategy and the availability of long-term funding, are considered in analyzing 
 liquidity risk. To reduce any perceived disparity between the liquidity and the terms of the debt instruments in which we 
 invest, we attempt to minimize our reliance on short-term financing arrangements. While we may finance certain 
 investments in security positions using traditional margin arrangements and reverse repurchase agreements, other 
 financial instruments such as collateralized debt obligations, and other longer-term financing vehicles may be utilized to 
 provide us with sources of long-term financing. 
 
 Prepayment risk. Prepayment risk is the risk that principal will be repaid at a different rate than anticipated, causing the 
 return on certain investments to be less than expected. As we receive prepayments of principal on our assets, any 
 premiums paid on such assets are amortized against interest income. In general, an increase in prepayment rates 
 accelerates the amortization of purchase premiums, thereby reducing the interest income earned on the assets. 
 Conversely, discounts on such assets are accreted into interest income. In general, an increase in prepayment rates 
 accelerates the accretion of purchase discounts, thereby increasing the interest income earned on the assets. 

LMM loan and ABS extension risk. Our Manager computes the projected weighted-average life of our assets based on 
 assumptions regarding the rate at which the borrowers will prepay the mortgages or extend. If prepayment rates decrease 
 in a rising interest rate environment or extension options are exercised, the life of the fixed-rate assets could extend 
 beyond the term of the secured debt agreements. This could have a negative impact on our results of operations. In some 
 situations, we may be forced to sell assets to maintain adequate liquidity, which could cause us to incur losses. 
 
 Real estate risk. The market values of commercial assets are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a 
 number of factors, including, but not limited to, national, regional and local economic conditions (which may be 
 adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors); local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of 
 housing, retail, industrial, office or other commercial space); changes or continued weakness in specific industry 
 segments; construction quality, construction cost, age and design; demographic factors; and retroactive changes to 
 building or similar codes. In addition, decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral and the potential 
 proceeds available to a borrower to repay the underlying loans, which could also cause us to suffer losses. 
 
 Fair value risk. The estimated fair value of our investments fluctuates primarily due to changes in interest rates. 
 Generally, in a rising interest rate environment, the estimated fair value of the fixed-rate investments would be expected 
 to decrease; conversely, in a decreasing interest rate environment, the estimated fair value of the fixed-rate investments 
 would be expected to increase. As market volatility increases or liquidity decreases, the fair value of our assets recorded 
 and/or disclosed may be adversely impacted. Our economic exposure is generally limited to our net investment position 
 as we seek to fund fixed rate investments with fixed rate financing or variable rate financing hedged with interest rate 
 swaps. 
 
 Counterparty risk. We finance the acquisition of a significant portion of our commercial mortgage loans, MBS and other 
 assets with our repurchase agreements, credit facilities, and other financing agreements. In connection with these 
 financing arrangements, we pledge our mortgage loans and securities as collateral to secure the borrowings. The amount 
 of collateral pledged will typically exceed the amount of the borrowings (i.e. the haircut) such that the borrowings will 
 be over-collateralized. As a result, we are exposed to the counterparty if, during the term of the financing, a lender 
 should default on its obligation and we are not able to recover our pledged assets. The amount of this exposure is the 
 difference between the amount loaned to us plus interest due to the counterparty and the fair value of the collateral 
 pledged by us to the lender including accrued interest receivable on such collateral. 

93 

We are exposed to changing interest rates and market conditions, which affects cash flows associated with borrowings. 
 We enter into derivative instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to mitigate these risks. Interest rate swaps are used to 
 mitigate the exposure to changes in interest rates and involve the receipt of variable-rate interest amounts from a 
 counterparty in exchange for us making payments based on a fixed interest rate over the life of the swap contract. 
 Certain of our subsidiaries have entered into over-the-counter OTC interest rate swap agreements to hedge risks 
 associated with movements in interest rates. Because certain interest rate swaps were not cleared through a central 
 counterparty, we remain exposed to the counterparty's ability to perform its obligations under each such swap and cannot 
 look to the creditworthiness of a central counterparty for performance. As a result, if an OTC swap counterparty cannot 
 perform under the terms of an interest rate swap, our subsidiary would not receive payments due under that agreement, 
 we may lose any unrealized gain associated with the interest rate swap and the hedged liability would cease to be hedged 
 by the interest rate swap. While we would seek to terminate the relevant OTC swap transaction and may have a claim 
 against the defaulting counterparty for any losses, including unrealized gains, there is no assurance that we would be able 
 to recover such amounts or to replace the relevant swap on economically viable terms or at all. In such case, we could be 
 forced to cover our unhedged liabilities at the then current market price. We may also be at risk for any collateral we 
 have pledged to secure our obligations under the OTC interest rate swap if the counterparty becomes insolvent or files 
 for bankruptcy. Therefore, upon a default by an interest rate swap agreement counterparty, the interest rate swap would 
 no longer mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates as intended.

In the table above, 
 The counterparty ratings presented are the long-term issuer credit rating as rated by S P and Moody s, 
 respectively. 
 The amount at risk reflects the difference between the amount loaned through repurchase agreements, including 
 interest payable, and the cash and fair value of the assets pledged as collateral, including accrued interest 
 receivable. 
 
 Capital market risk. We are exposed to risks related to the equity capital markets, and our related ability to raise capital 
 through the issuance of our common stock or other equity instruments. We are also exposed to risks related to the debt 
 capital markets, and our related ability to finance our business through borrowings under repurchase obligations or other 
 financing arrangements. As a REIT, we are required to distribute a significant portion of our taxable income annually, 
 which constrains our ability to accumulate operating cash flow and therefore requires us to utilize debt or equity capital 
 to finance our business. We seek to mitigate these risks by monitoring the debt and equity capital markets to inform our 
 decisions on the amount, timing, and terms of capital we raise . 
 
 Off-balance sheet risk. Off-balance sheet risk refers to situations where the maximum potential loss resulting from 
 changes in the level or volatility of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates or market values of the underlying 
 financial instruments may result in changes in the value of a particular financial instrument in excess of the reported 
 amounts of such assets and liabilities currently reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 Inflation risk. Most of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature. As a result, interest rates and other 
 factors influence our performance significantly more than inflation does. Changes in interest rates may, but do not 
 necessarily, correlate with inflation rates and/or changes in inflation rates. Refer to Quantitative and Qualitative 
 Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk in this Form 10-Q for a discussion on interest rate sensitivity.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be 
 disclosed in its Exchange Act, reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified 
 in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to its management, including 
 its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required 
 disclosure based on the definition of "disclosure controls and procedures" as promulgated under the Exchange Act and 
 the rules and regulations thereunder. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management 
 recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable 
 assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in 
 evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. The Company, including its Chief Executive 
 Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and 
 procedures as of September 30, 2024 . Based on the foregoing, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
 Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes to the Company s internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule 
 13a-15(f) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to 
 materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, the Company may be involved in various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of business. 
 On June 6, 2024, a purported former stockholder of Broadmark filed a class action lawsuit, captioned Eibling v. Pyatt, et 
 al., Case No. C-24-CV-24-000818, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland (the Action ). The Action names 
 as defendants Broadmark s former board of directors and alleges they breached their fiduciary duties in connection with 
 the Broadmark Merger by failing to properly consider acquisition proposals that were purportedly superior to the 
 Broadmark Merger, by relying on purportedly false and misleading valuation analyses, and by authorizing the issuance 
 of a purportedly false and misleading proxy statement. The Action also asserts claims against Broadmark s financial 
 advisor for aiding and abetting these alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. The Action seeks damages in the form of 
 compensatory damages, quasi-appraisal damages, rescissory damages, and disgorgement of any merger-related benefits. 
 The Action also seeks reimbursement for litigation expenses and attorneys and experts fees. On September 13, 2024, 
 the Action was assigned to the Business and Technology Case Management Program of the Circuit Court for Baltimore 
 City, Maryland. Although the Company is not a defendant in the Action, it is subject to contractual indemnification 
 obligations (conditioned on the satisfaction of various contractual requirements) in connection therewith, including with 
 respect to the defendants service as Broadmark directors and provision of services to Broadmark, as applicable. The 
 defendants intend to vigorously defend against the Action. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 There have been no material changes from risk factors previously disclosed in the Company s Form 10-K under Part I, 
 Item 1A. You should be aware that these risk factors and other information may not describe every risk facing us. 
 Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may 
 materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 On March 6, 2018, our Board approved a share repurchase program authorizing, but not obligating, the repurchase of our 
 common stock, and on September 29, 2022, our Board approved an increase to the size of the share repurchase program 

95 

bringing the total authorized repurchases thereunder to 50.0 million. To facilitate further repurchases, on June 1, 2023, 
 our Board approved a new share repurchase program, replacing the previous program, authorizing, but not obligating, 
 the repurchase of up to 100.0 million of our common stock. Repurchases under the stock repurchase programs may be 
 made at management s discretion from time to time on the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or 
 otherwise, in each case subject to compliance with all Securities and Exchange Commission rules and other legal 
 requirements and may be made in part under one or more Rule 10b5-1 plans, which permit stock repurchases at times 
 when we might otherwise be precluded from doing so. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions will be 
 determined by our management based on its evaluation of market conditions, share price, legal requirements and other 
 factors.
