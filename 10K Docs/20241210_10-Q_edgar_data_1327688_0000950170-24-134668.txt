Total stock-based compensation expense 

As of October 31, 2024, there was million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs, stock options and stock purchase rights under the ESPP, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of approximately years. 

 million and million during the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024, respectively, and an income tax benefit of million and million during the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively. The income tax provision recorded in the first three quarters of fiscal 2025 were primarily attributable to state income taxes. The income tax benefit recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was primarily attributable to the release of million valuation allowance on certain preexisting deferred tax assets that were realized as a result of deferred tax liabilities assumed in the Company's acquisition of 2600hz, Inc. ("2600Hz") in October 2023. As of October 31, 2024, the Company continued to maintain a full valuation allowance against its remaining deferred tax assets. As of October 31, 2024, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million, none of which would currently affect the Company's effective tax rate if recognized due to the Company's deferred tax assets being fully offset by a valuation allowance. The Company does not anticipate that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits relating to tax positions existing at October 31, 2024 will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months. There were interest expense or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits recorded through October 31, 2024. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, the Company believes that its reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome. The Company adjusts these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash.

Legal Proceedings In addition to the litigation matters described below, from time to time, the Company may be involved in a variety of other claims, lawsuits, investigations, and proceedings relating to contractual disputes, intellectual property rights, employment matters, regulatory compliance matters, and other litigation matters relating to various claims that arise in the normal course of business. Defending such proceedings is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees, the Company may receive unfavorable preliminary or interim rulings in the course of litigation, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained. The Company determines whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company assesses its potential liability by analyzing specific litigation and regulatory matters using reasonably available information. The Company develops its views on estimated losses in consultation with inside and outside counsel, which involves a subjective analysis of potential results and outcomes, assuming various combinations of appropriate litigation and settlement strategies. Legal fees are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. As of October 31, 2024, the Company did t have any accrued liabilities recorded for loss contingencies in its consolidated financial statements . Canadian Litigation On February 3, 2021, plaintiff Fiona Chiu filed a class action complaint against the Company and Ooma Canada Inc. in the Federal Court of Canada, alleging violations of Canada s Trademarks Act and Competition Act. The complaint seeks monetary and other damages and/or injunctive relief enjoining the Company from describing and marketing its Basic Home Phone using the word free or otherwise representing that it is free. On November 9, 2021, the Federal Court of Canada removed Ms. Chiu and substituted John Zanin as the new plaintiff in the proceeding. In connection with the substitution of Mr. Zanin as the new plaintiff, the Federal Court of Canada deemed the proceeding as having commenced on November 8, 2021 instead of February 3, 2021. In January 2022, the Federal Court of Canada heard arguments from counsel representing each of the Company and Mr. Zanin regarding jurisdiction and class action certification issues, and the parties are awaiting the Court's ruling. The Company intends to continue to defend itself vigorously against this complaint. Based on the Company s current knowledge, the Company has determined that the amount of any reasonably possible loss resulting from the Canadian Litigation is not estimable. Indemnification The Company enters into standard indemnification arrangements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these arrangements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified parties for certain losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party. In some cases, the term of these indemnification agreements is perpetual. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements is not determinable because it involves claims that may be made against the Company in the future but have not yet been made. The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and officers that may require the Company to indemnify its directors and officers against liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers, other than liabilities arising from willful misconduct of the individual. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, the Company has director and officer insurance coverage that reduces the Company s exposure and enables the Company to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. To date the Company has not incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements. No liability associated with such indemnifications has been recorded to date.

Intangible assets acquired primarily consisted of developed technology of million, which represented the fair values of the acquired 2600Hz developed platform technology and have an estimated useful life of seven years as of the date of acquisition. The goodwill recognized was primarily attributable to the assembled workforce and is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The Company believes it is not practicable to separately identify earnings of 2600Hz on a stand-alone basis due to the integrated nature of the Company's operations. On a pro forma basis, had the 2600Hz acquisition been included in the Company's consolidated results of operations beginning February 1, 2022, the Company s total revenue would have approximate d million for the three months ended October 31, 2023, and approximated million for the nine months ended October 31, 2023. T hese pro forma revenue amounts do not necessarily represent what would have occurred if the business combination had taken place on February 1, 2022, nor do these amounts represent the results that may occur in the future. Pro forma net income (losses) have not been presented because the impact was not material to the consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the acquisition, the Company agreed to issue approximately restricted stock units that are subject to on-going service conditions and vest over an period. The fair value of these awards of million is being recorded as stock compensation expense over the service period. During the second fiscal quarter of 2023, the Company acquired OnSIP for million. During the nine months ended October 31, 2023 , the Company received million from the seller for certain working capital adjustments, which is recorded in investing activities in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.

We primarily offer our solutions in the United States and Canada, with limited offerings in certain other countries. 
 We refer to Ooma Office, Ooma Enterprise, Ooma AirDial, 2600Hz, and OnSIP collectively as Ooma Business. Ooma Residential includes Ooma Telo basic and premier services, as well as Ooma Telo LTE services. 
 Third Quarter Fiscal 2025 Financial Performance 
 Total revenue was 65.1 million, up 9 year-over-year, primarily driven by the growth of Ooma Business. 

Subscription and services revenue from Ooma Business grew 7 year-over-year, driven by user growth. 

Total gross margin was 60 , comparable to 62 in the prior year quarter. 

GAAP net loss was 2.4 million, compared to net income of 2.3 million in the prior year quarter reflecting continued investments in our operations and the income tax benefit realized in the prior year quarter due to the acquired intangible assets related to 2600Hz, which did not recur in the current quarter. 

Adjusted EBITDA was 5.7 million, compared to 5.0 million in the prior year quarter. 

As of October 31, 2024, we had total cash and cash equivalents of 17.1 million, compared to 17.5 million as of January 31, 2024.

Core Users increased year-over-year, which was primarily driven by growth in business users. As of October 31, 2024, Ooma Business users comprised approximately 41 of our total core users, up from 38 as of October 31, 2023. We believe that the number of our core users is an indicator of our market penetration, the growth of our business and our anticipated future subscription and services revenue. We define our core users as the number of active residential user accounts and business user extensions (excluding Talkatone and 2600Hz users). We believe that the relationship that we establish with our core users positions us to sell additional premium communications services and other new connected services to them. 
 Annualized Exit Recurring Revenue ("AERR") grew year-over-year due to an increase in the average revenue per core user, which was largely driven by an increasing mix of business users. We believe that AERR is an indicator of recurring subscription and services revenue for near-term future periods. We estimate our AERR by dividing our recurring quarterly subscription revenue from our Core Users by the average number of core users each quarter and annualize by multiplying by four. We then multiply that result by the number of core users at the end of the period to calculate AERR. Beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the AERR includes the annual recurring revenue from 2600Hz. 
 Net Dollar Subscription Retention Rate NDRR increased due to reduction in user churn and increase in Average Monthly Recurring Subscription Revenue. We believe that our net dollar subscription retention rate provides insight into our ability to retain and grow our subscription and services revenue and is an indicator of the long-term value of our customer relationships and the stability of our revenue base. 
 We define our NDRR as (i) one plus (ii) the quotient of Net Dollar Change divided by Average Monthly Recurring Subscription Revenue. We define Net Dollar Change as the quotient of (i) the difference of our Monthly Recurring Subscription Revenue at the end of a period minus our Monthly Recurring Subscription Revenue at the beginning of a period minus our Monthly Recurring Subscription Revenue at the end of the period from new customers we added during the period, all divided by (ii) the number of months in the period. We define our Average Monthly Recurring Subscription Revenue as the average of the Monthly Recurring Subscription Revenue at the beginning and end of the measurement period. 
 
 Ooma | FY2025 Form 10-Q | 19 

Adjusted EBITDA 
 In addition, we use Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest Tax and Depreciation and Amortization) to manage our business, evaluate our performance and make planning decisions. We consider this metric to be a useful measure of our operating performance, because it contains adjustments for unusual events or factors that do not directly affect what management considers being the core operating performance, and are used by our management for that purpose. We also believe this measure enables us to better evaluate our performance by facilitating a meaningful comparison of our core operating results in a given period to those in prior and future periods. Investors often use similar measures to evaluate the operating performance with competitors. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest and other income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization of capital expenditures, amortization of intangible assets and acquisition related costs, stock-based compensation and related taxes, litigation costs, restructuring costs, gain on note conversion, and facilities consolidation gain. 
 Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not consider any expenses for assets being depreciated and amortized that are necessary to our business; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the impact of interest and other income/expense, income taxes, stock-based compensation and related taxes, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related costs, litigation costs, restructuring costs and non-recurring gains; and 

Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. 

Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered alongside other financial performance measures, including net loss and our other GAAP results. 
 The following table provides a reconciliation of GAAP net loss to Adjusted EBITDA, for each the periods indicated (in thousands):

Components of Results of Operations	 
 Revenue 
 Subscription and services revenue is derived primarily from recurring subscription fees related to service plans such as Ooma Business, Ooma Residential and other communications services, and to a lesser extent from payments associated with our Talkatone mobile application and prepaid international calls. We expect our subscription and services revenue to grow as we expand our core user base, driven primarily by growth in Ooma Business. 
 Product and other revenue consists primarily of sales of our on-premise devices and end-point devices used in connection with our services, including shipping and handling fees for our direct customers. 
 Cost of revenue and gross margin 
 Cost of subscription and services revenue includes payments made for third-party network operations and telecommunications services, license fees, certain telecom taxes and fees, including Federal Universal Service Fund USF contributions, credit card processing fees, costs to build out and maintain data centers, depreciation and maintenance of servers and equipment, personnel costs associated with customer care and network operations support, amortization of certain acquired intangible assets, and allocated overhead costs. 
 Cost of product and other revenue includes the costs associated with the manufacturing of our on-premise devices and end-point devices, including Ooma AirDial, as well as personnel costs for employees and contractors, costs related to porting our customers phone numbers to our service, shipping and handling costs, tariffs imposed on imported product and allocated overhead costs. 
 Subscription and services gross margin may fluctuate from period-to-period based on the interplay of a number of factors, including revenue mix and fluctuations in the costs described above. We expect our subscription and services gross margin to increase over the long-term, primarily as we achieve scale efficiencies and as Ooma Business revenue becomes a larger majority of total subscription revenue. 
 Product and other gross margin may fluctuate from period-to-period based on a number of factors, including total units shipped as compared to the direct costs of production and relatively fixed personnel costs incurred. We sell our on-premise devices at aggressive price points to facilitate the adoption of our platforms and services. Additionally, some product costs have become subject to significantly higher pricing that we experienced due to supply chain constraints in the global macroeconomic environment and, increasing tariffs, as well as certain components becoming subject to end-of-life and we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Another factor is the high AirDial installation costs due to ramp up efforts. Accordingly, we expect our product and other gross margin will continue to be negatively impacted by these higher component costs and AirDial installation costs. We expect our product and other gross margin to continue to be negative for the foreseeable future. 
 Our subscription and services gross margin is significantly higher than product and other gross margin. As a result, any significant change in revenue mix will cause our total gross margin to change. For example, in periods where we sell significantly more on-premise devices or other products, we would expect our total gross margin to be impacted. 
 Operating expenses 
 Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for employees and contractors, advertising and marketing costs, sales commissions paid to internal sales personnel and third parties, amortization of capitalized sales commissions, amortization of acquired customer relationship intangible assets, travel expenses and allocated overhead costs. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to grow our business. 
 Research and development expenses are focused on developing new and expanded features for our solutions and improvements to our platforms and backend architecture. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for employees and contractors, including third-party development, and allocated overhead costs. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to grow our business. 
 General and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs for our finance, legal, human resources and other administrative employees and contractors, as well as professional service fees, certain acquisition-related costs, and allocated overhead costs. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to grow our business.

Ooma | FY2025 Form 10-Q | 22 

Three months ended October 31, 2024 Compared to Three months ended October 31, 2023 
 We derived approximately 62 and 58 of our total revenue from Ooma Business and approximately 36 and 39 from Ooma Residential for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Subscription and services revenue increased 4.2 million or 8 year-over-year, primarily attributable to an increase in our core users, an increase in AirDial lines, and an increase in the average revenue per core user. Revenue increase year-over-year is also partially attributable to revenue contributed from 2600Hz, which we acquired at the end of third quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 Product and other revenue increased 1.0 million or 26 year-over-year, primarily attributable to an increase of AirDial units shipped, sale of accessories to Ooma Enterprise customers, and other revenue contributed from 2600Hz. 
 Nine months ended October 31, 2024 Compared to Nine months ended October 31, 2023 
 We derived approximately 61 and 57 of our total revenue from Ooma Business and approximately 36 and 41 from Ooma Residential for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Subscription and services revenue increased 14.4 million or 9 year-over-year, primarily attributable to an increase in our core users, an increase in AirDial lines, and an increase in the average revenue per core user, driven by organic growth, which was in part due to higher sales to our Office and Enterprise customers, and revenue contributed from 2600Hz. 
 Product and other revenue increased 2.3 million or 20 year-over-year, primarily attributable to the increase of AirDial units shipped and sale of accessories to Ooma Enterprise customers.

Ooma | FY2025 Form 10-Q | 23 

Three months ended October 31, 2024 Compared to Three months ended October 31, 2023 
 Subscription and services gross margin of 70 decreased year-over-year from 71 . Cost of subscription and services revenue increased 2.0 million or 13 year-over-year, primarily due to a 0.6 million increase in infrastructure costs, a 0.5 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, a 0.4 million increase in personnel-related costs, and a 0.5 million increase in regulatory fees. Overall, the increase in the cost of subscription and services in part reflects growth of Ooma Business and an increase in infrastructure costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets related to 2600Hz. 
 Product and other revenue gross margin increased to negative 57 from negative 74 in the prior year period. The negative product margin was primarily due to the depletion of certain higher cost components that we procured in prior fiscal years to stay ahead of pandemic driven supply chain issues. 
 Nine months ended October 31, 2024 Compared to Nine months ended October 31, 2023 
 Subscription and services gross margin of 70 decreased year-over-year from 72 . Cost of subscription and services revenue increased 6.9 million year-over-year, primarily due to a 2.7 million increase in infrastructure costs, a 1.9 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, a 1.4 million increase in regulatory fees, and a 1.3 million increase in personnel-related costs, partially offset by a 0.4 million decrease in supplies and equipment costs. 
 Product and other revenue gross margin increase to negative 65 from negative 70 in the prior year period, primarily due to the depletion of certain higher cost components that we procured in prior fiscal years to stay ahead of pandemic driven supply chain issues.

 Research and development expenses increased 1.7 million or 14 year-over-year, primarily due to a 1.2 million increase in personnel and contractor related costs, driven by higher headcount, and a 0.7 million increase in restructuring costs, partially offset by a 0.2 million decrease in supplies and equipment costs. 
 General and administrative expenses increased 0.6 million or 8 year-over-year, primarily due to a 1.0 million increase in personnel-related costs to scale with the overall growth of our business, partially offset by a 0.4 million decrease in acquisition-related costs. 
 Nine months ended October 31, 2024 Compared to Nine months ended October 31, 2023 
 Sales and marketing expenses increased 3.2 million or 6 year-over-year, primarily due to a 4.4 million increase in personnel-related costs and a 0.2 million increase in amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by a 1.4 million decrease in advertising and marketing costs. 
 Research and development expenses increased 5.4 million or 15 year-over-year, primarily due to a 4.2 million increase in personnel-related costs, driven by higher headcount, a 1.2 million increase in restructuring costs, and a 0.3 million increase in allocated overhead costs, partially offset by a 0.3 million decrease in hosting costs. 
 General and administrative expenses increased 3.0 million or 15 year-over-year, primarily due to a 1.9 million increase in personnel-related costs, driven by higher headcount, an absence of a 1.0 million facility consolidation gain which did not recur in the current fiscal year, a 0.3 million increase in restructuring costs, partially offset by a 0.4 million decrease in acquisition-related costs. 
 A significant portion of the year-over-year increase in personnel-related costs and amortization of intangible assets for operating expenses was due to the 2600Hz acquisition near the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of October 31, 2024, we had 17.1 million of total cash and cash equivalents, which we believe will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the introduction of new and enhanced offerings, the timing and extent of our sales and marketing activities and research and development expenditures and other factors. We may in the future make investments in or acquisitions of businesses or technologies, which may require the use of cash.

For the nine months ended October 31, 2024, our net loss of 6.6 million included non-cash items of 22.4 million primarily related to stock-based compensation, operating lease expense, depreciation and amortization expense and gain on note conversion. Operating asset and liability changes for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 included: 
 a decrease of 1.6 million in accounts receivable due to the timing of customer cash collections; 

a decrease of 6.6 million in inventories and deferred inventory costs; 

an increase of 2.5 million in prepaid expenses and other current and non-current assets; 

a net decrease of 2.7 million in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities due to the timing of payments; and 

a decrease of 0.1 million in deferred revenue. 

Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 increased 12.0 million year-over-year, which primarily reflected working capital impacts resulting from the timing of payments. Although we have generated cash from operations in recent periods, our operating cash flow may not remain positive in the future as we continue to invest in efforts to scale our business. 
 Ooma | FY2025 Form 10-Q | 25 

Investing Activities 
 For the nine months ended October 31, 2024, cash used in investing activities was 4.8 million, which consisted of capital expenditures of 4.8 million. Cash used in investing activities decreased 26.3 million year-over-year primarily due to the absence of cash outflow for the 2600Hz acquisition in the current periods, partially offset by receipt of proceeds from investment maturities in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, which did not recur in the first three quarters of fiscal 2025. 
 Financing Activities 
 For the nine months ended October 31, 2024, cash used in financing activities was 14.4 million, which consisted of 13.0 million debt repayments, payments of 2.8 million related to shares repurchased for tax withholdings on vesting of RSUs, and payments of 2.1 million under our stock repurchase plan, offset by proceeds of 3.5 million from the issuance of common stock from our ESPP and stock option exercises. Cash used in financing activities increased 33.4 million year-over-year, which primarily reflected a borrowing of 18.0 million under our Credit Agreement for the 2600Hz acquisition in fiscal 2024, which did not recur in the first three quarters of fiscal 2025, and repayments of borrowings outstanding under our Credit Agreement in fiscal 2025. 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 In October 2023, we entered into a credit and security agreement with certain banks that provides for a secured revolving credit facility under which we may borrow up to an aggregate of 30.0 million and, subject to certain conditions, may be increased to up to 50.0 million. As of October 31, 2024, we had 3.0 million of outstanding borrowings and were in compliance with all loan covenants.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Our Management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of October 31, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of October 31, 2024, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended October 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We have not experienced any significant impact to our internal controls over financial reporting despite the fact that most of our employees who are involved in our financial reporting processes and controls are continuing to work remotely. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls. Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 For a discussion of legal proceedings, see Note 11: Commitments and Contingencies of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q, which information is incorporated herein by reference. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors 
 Our current and prospective investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements," before making investment decisions regarding our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only ones we face but include the most significant factors currently known by us. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, also may become important factors that affect us. If any of the risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. 
 Risk Factor Summary 
 Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and the following is a summary of key risk factors when considering an investment. This summary should be read together with the more detailed description of each risk factor contained in the subheadings further below and should not be relied upon as an exhaustive summary of the material risks facing our business: 
 Risks Related to Our Business and Industry 
 If we are unable to attract new users in a cost-effective manner, our business will be materially and adversely affected. 

Our customers may terminate their subscriptions for our services in most cases without penalty, and increased customer turnover, as well as costs we incur to retain our customers and induce them to add users and/or functionality could materially and adversely affect our financial performance. 

A significant portion of our revenues today come from small and medium-sized businesses, which may have fewer financial resources to weather an economic downturn, rising inflation, and defaults by financial institutions. 

If we are unable to develop, acquire and/or sell new, or enhance existing, products, services or applications on a timely and cost-effective basis, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 

We may expand through acquisitions of, or investments in, other companies, each of which may divert our management s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders, increase expenses, disrupt our operations and harm our results of operations. 

We depend on several sole suppliers to provide the components for, and a small number of vendors to manufacture, certain on-premise devices and end-point devices we sell, and any delay or interruption in manufacturing, configuring and delivering by these third parties would result in delayed or reduced shipments to our customers and may increase our costs and harm our business and results of operations. 

A ransomware attack or other security breach could delay or interrupt service to our customers, compromise the integrity of our systems or data that we collect, result in the loss of our intellectual property or confidential information, harm our reputation, or subject us to significant liability. 

We rely significantly on retailers and reseller partnerships to sell our products our failure to effectively develop, manage and maintain these sales channels could materially and adversely affect our revenue and business. 

We face competition in our markets by our competitors (including mergers or other strategic transactions involving our competitors) and may lack sufficient financial or other resources to compete successfully. 

We may be exposed to significant risks in connection with our international operations. 

To deliver our services, we rely on third parties for our network connectivity and co location facilities for certain features in our services and for certain elements of providing our services. 

Ooma | FY2025 Form 10-Q | 28 

Interruptions in our software or services could harm our reputation, result in significant costs to us and impair our ability to sell our services. 

We rely on third parties, including third parties located in Russia, for some of our software development, quality assurance and operations, and anticipate we will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. 

We rely on third parties to provide the majority of our customer service and support representatives. If these third parties do not provide our customers with reliable, high quality service, our reputation and our business will be harmed, and we may be exposed to significant liability. 

Our business could suffer if we cannot obtain or retain direct inward dialing numbers, or DIDs, are prohibited from obtaining local or toll-free numbers, or are limited to distributing local or toll-free numbers to only certain customers. 

If we are unable to effectively process local number and toll-free number portability provisioning in a timely manner, our growth may be negatively affected. 

We may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future and our rates of growth may decline. 

Our quarterly and annual results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to do so. As a result, we may fail to meet or to exceed the expectations of analysts or investors, which could cause our stock price to fluctuate. 

If additional tariffs or other restrictions are placed on our goods imported from other countries, or if the United States were to withdraw from or modify existing trade agreements or regulations, our revenue, gross margin, and results of operations may be materially harmed. 

If we do not manage inventory levels and purchase commitments effectively, we may experience excess inventory levels, inventory obsolescence, or inventory shortages that could adversely affect our results of operations. 

Our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition. 

Our existing credit agreement imposes operating and financial restrictions on us. 

Risks Related to Security, IT Systems and Intellectual Property 
 We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant costs to protect against security breaches. We may incur significant additional costs in the future to address any actual or perceived security breaches. 

Failures in internet infrastructure or interference with broadband access, or providers of broadband services blocking or degrading our services, could cause current or potential customers to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading our current customers to switch to our competitors or potential customers to avoid using our services. 

If we experience excessive fraudulent activity or cannot meet evolving credit card association merchant standards, we could incur substantial costs and lose the right to accept credit cards for payment, which could cause our customer base to decline significantly. 

Any failure to obtain protection of our intellectual property rights could materially and adversely affect our business. 

Risks Related to Regulatory and Tax Matters 
 Future legislative or regulatory actions, such as the adoption of additional 911 requirements or new taxes, could increase our costs and adversely affect our business and expose us to liability. 

If we cannot comply with regulations, including communications and telecommunications laws and rules of the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") imposing call signaling requirements on VoIP providers like us, we may be subject to fines, cease and desist orders, restrictions on our business, or other penalties. 

The FCC has continued to increase regulation of interconnected VoIP services and may at any time determine certain VoIP services are telecommunications services subject to traditional common carrier regulation. 

Reform of federal and state USF programs could increase the cost of our service to our customers, diminishing or eliminating our pricing advantage. 

We process, store, and use personal information and other data, which subjects us and our customers to a variety of evolving industry standards, contractual obligations and other legal rules related to privacy, which may increase our costs, decrease adoption and use of our products and services, and expose us to liability. 

Ooma | FY2025 Form 10-Q | 29 

Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry 
 If we are unable to attract new users in a cost-effective manner, our business will be materially and adversely affected. 
 In order to grow our business, we must continue to attract new users in a cost-effective manner. We use and periodically adjust the mix of advertising and marketing programs to promote our services. Significant increases in the pricing of one or more of our advertising channels could increase our advertising costs or may cause us to choose less expensive and perhaps less effective channels to promote our services. As we add to or change the mix of our advertising and marketing strategies, we may need to expand into channels with significantly higher costs than our current programs, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. We will incur advertising and marketing expenses in advance of when we anticipate recognizing any revenue generated by such expenses, and we may fail to experience an increase in revenue or brand awareness as a result of such expenditures. We have made in the past, and may make in the future, significant expenditures and investments in new advertising campaigns, and we cannot assure you that any such investments will lead to the cost-effective acquisition of additional customers. New users are drawn to our products and services by rankings circulated by organizations such as Amazon, Apple and Google app stores and highly regarded publications such as PCMag and Consumer Reports. If we are unable to maintain effective advertising programs and garner favorable rankings, our ability to attract new customers could be materially and adversely affected, which could lead us to increase our advertising and marketing expenditures substantially, and our results of operations may suffer. 
 We market our products and services principally to businesses and households. Some of these business customers and consumers are less technically knowledgeable and may be resistant to new technologies such as our cloud-based communications solutions and our connected services. Because our potential customers need to connect additional hardware at their location and take other steps not required for the use of traditional communications services such as telephone, fax and e-mail, these customers may be reluctant to use our service. These customers may also lack sufficient resources, financial or otherwise, to invest in learning about our services, and therefore may be unwilling to adopt them. If these customers choose not to adopt our services, our ability to grow our business could be negatively affected. 
 Our customers may terminate their subscriptions for our service in most cases without penalty, and increased customer turnover, as well as costs we incur to retain our customers, encourage them to add users and purchase additional functionalities and premium services, could materially and adversely affect our financial performance. 
 Our service plans are generally sold as monthly subscriptions and our customers may terminate their monthly subscription for convenience without any penalty. Certain of our service plans are also sold as annual and multi-year subscriptions, typically ranging up to three years. However, our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for such services and may elect to terminate their subscription for any number of reasons. In addition, evolving state and federal laws, regulations, and rules, including the Federal Trade Commission s Click-to-Cancel Rule announced on October 16, 2024, aimed at making cancellation easier for customers, may result in greater numbers of customer terminations. As a result, we have no assurance that the revenue stream associated with a particular customer account will continue beyond the initial subscription term. Additionally, our Ooma Business customers may choose to reduce the number of lines or remove some of the solutions to which they subscribe. Given Ooma Business customers generally pay more for their subscriptions than residential or mobile customers, any increased churn in business customers could materially and adversely affect our core user growth, financial performance and results of operations, and thereby increase the costs we incur in our efforts to retain our customers and encourage them to upgrade their services and increase their number of users. 
 Our core user churn rate could increase significantly in the future if customers are not satisfied with our service, the value proposition of our services, our ability to otherwise meet their needs and expectations, and/or other factors beyond our control, including the impact of inflation and other macroeconomic developments. As a result, we may have to acquire new customers or new users within our existing customer base on an ongoing basis simply to maintain our existing level of revenue. If a significant number of customers, or one or more larger customers, terminate, reduce or fail to renew their subscriptions, we may need to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than anticipated to maintain or increase our revenue, which could harm our business and results of operations. Our efforts to mitigate risk of customer churn due to any factor may divert management s time and focus away from efforts to address customer churn due to other factors. This broad-based susceptibility to churn could materially and adversely affect our financial performance. 
 Our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional subscriptions and functionalities to our current customer base, which may require increasingly sophisticated, costlier sales efforts and a longer sales cycle. Any increase in the costs necessary to upgrade, expand and retain existing customers could materially and adversely affect our financial performance. Such increased costs could cause us to increase our subscription rates, which could increase our customer turnover rate. If our efforts to convince customers to add users and, in the future, to purchase additional functionalities are not successful, our business may suffer. 
 Ooma | FY2025 Form 10-Q | 30 

A significant portion of our revenues today come from small and medium-sized businesses, which may have fewer financial resources to weather an economic downturn, rising inflation, and defaults by financial institutions. 
 A significant portion of our revenues today comes from small and medium-sized businesses. These customers may be more susceptible to negative impact from economic downturns, rising inflation, and defaults by financial institutions than larger, more established businesses as these businesses typically have fewer financial resources than larger entities. 
 As the majority of our customers pay for our subscriptions through credit and debit cards, weakness in certain segments of the credit markets and in the United States and global economies has resulted in and may in the future result in increased numbers of rejected credit and debit card payments and business failures, which could materially affect our business by increased customer default or cancellations. If small and medium-sized businesses experience financial hardship or declare bankruptcy as a result of a weak economy, defaults by financial institutions, or for any other reason, the overall demand for our subscriptions could be materially and adversely affected. 
 If we are unable to develop, acquire and/or sell new, or enhance existing, products, services or applications on a timely and cost-effective basis, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 
 The cloud-based communications and connected services industries are characterized by rapid changes in customer requirements, frequent introductions of new and enhanced services, and continuing and rapid technological advancement. To compete successfully in these emerging markets, we must anticipate and adapt to unpredictable technological changes and evolving industry standards and continue to design, develop, manufacture and sell new and enhanced services and products that provide increasingly higher levels of performance and reliability at lower cost. For fiscal 2024, we derived approximately 58 of our revenue from Ooma Business and approximately 40 from Ooma Residential and expect they will continue to account for most of our revenue for the foreseeable future. 
 However, our future success will also depend on our ability to introduce and sell new services, such as our fiscal 2023 launch of Ooma Office Pro Plus or our 2600Hz solutions, as well as products, features and functionality that enhance or are beyond the voice, fax, text and connected services we currently offer, as well as to improve usability and support and increase customer satisfaction. The success of new product introductions, such as our fiscal 2023 launch of AirDial, depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to: pricing, market and customer acceptance, the ability to successfully identify and anticipate product trends, effective forecasting and management of product demand, purchase commitments and inventory levels, availability of products in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated demand, ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of components for our new products from third-party suppliers, management of manufacturing and supply costs, management of risks and delays associated with product design and production ramp-up , delays in customer readiness for AirDial installations, the quality of AirDial installations performed by third-parties, ability to maintain the levels of service uptime and performance required by our customers, and the risk that new products or enhanced versions of existing products, may have quality issues or other defects or bugs in the early stages of introduction including testing of new components and features. Moreover, the market for plain old telephone service ("POTS") line replacement is relatively new and characterized by long sales cycles, and Ooma AirDial may not result in long-term success or significant revenue for us. Our failure to develop solutions that satisfy customer preferences in a timely and cost-effective manner may harm our ability to renew our subscriptions with existing customers and to create or increase demand for our services and products and may materially and adversely impact our results of operations. 
 The introduction or announcement of new services and technologies by our competitors, including artificial intelligence ("AI") tools, could make our existing solutions obsolete, cause customers to defer purchases of our products and services, or otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further, we may experience higher product returns from retailers or reseller partners and may face challenges managing the inventory of new or existing products, which could lead to excess inventory charges and/or discounting of such products. In addition, new products may have varying selling prices and higher costs or different kinds of costs compared to legacy products, which could negatively impact our gross margins and operating results. 
 Ooma | FY2025 Form 10-Q | 31 

We may experience difficulties with software development, operations, design or marketing that could delay or prevent the introduction or implementation of new or enhanced products, services and applications. We have in the past experienced and may in the future experience delays in the planned release dates of new features and upgrades and have discovered defects in new services and applications after their introduction. New products, or new features or upgrades to existing products and services, may not be released according to schedule, or, when released, they may contain defects, bugs or other quality or reliability problems that can interfere with their intended operations or the intended operation of the systems in which our products or services are installed, and there can be no assurance that our pre-shipment or pre-release testing programs will be adequate to detect all such quality or reliability problems. Either of these situations could result in adverse publicity, loss of revenue, higher than expected costs, delay in market acceptance or legal liabilities for claims by customers against us, all of which could harm our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Moreover, the development of new or enhanced products, services or applications may require substantial investment, and we must continue to invest a significant amount of resources in our research and development efforts to remain competitive. We do not know whether these investments will be successful. If we are unable to develop, license or acquire new or enhanced products, services and applications on a timely and cost effective basis, or if such new or enhanced products, services and applications do not achieve adequate market acceptance, we may not be able to realize a return on our investments and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 
 We may expand through acquisitions of, or investments in, other companies, each of which may divert our management s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders, increase expenses, disrupt our operations and harm our results of operations. 
 Our business strategy has in the past and may, from time to time in the future, include acquiring or investing in complementary services, technologies or businesses. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. If we do complete acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals, and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by users, customers or investors. If we fail to successfully integrate such acquisitions, or the technologies associated with such acquisitions, the revenue and operating results of the combined company could be adversely affected. Acquisitions may disrupt our ongoing operations, divert management from their primary responsibilities, subject us to additional liabilities, increase our expenses and adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. We may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology and accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including accounting charges. We have recorded significant goodwill and intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions, and in the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected revenue, we may be required to take material impairment charges that could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 We may have to pay cash, incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition, each of which could affect our financial condition or the value of our capital stock. The sale of equity to finance any such acquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders. If we incur debt it would result in increased fixed obligations and could also subject us to covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. In addition, our future operating results may be impacted by performance earnouts or contingent payments. Furthermore, acquisitions may require large one-time charges and can result in increased debt, such as the borrowing under our Credit Agreement which we undertook for the 2600Hz acquisition, or contingent liabilities, adverse tax consequences, additional stock-based compensation expense and the recording and subsequent amortization or impairments of amounts related to certain purchased intangible assets or goodwill, any of which could negatively impact our future results of operations. 
 When we enter into strategic transactions in which we acquire other companies, we cannot guarantee we will be able to successfully integrate the teams, assets, technologies or business of these target companies into our business, that we will be able to fully recover the costs of such transactions, that we will retain existing key customer and partner relationships, that we will be successful in leveraging such strategic transactions into increased business for our products, or that we will otherwise be able to achieve the intended results of the acquisitions. 
 We depend on several sole suppliers to provide the components for, and a small number of vendors to manufacture, certain on-premise devices and end-point devices we sell, and any delay or interruption in manufacturing, configuring and delivering by these third parties would result in delayed or reduced shipments to our customers and may increase our costs and harm our business and results of operations. 
 We primarily contract with manufacturers in Vietnam and other Asian countries to produce our on-premise devices and end-point devices and our results of operations has been and could be further affected by slowdowns in manufacturing due to external factors such as, global conflicts and other factors. 
 We currently do not have long-term contracts with our contract manufacturers and they are not obligated to provide products to, or perform services for, us for any specific period, in any specific quantities or at any specific price, except as 
 Ooma | FY2025 Form 10-Q | 32 

may be provided in a particular purchase order. If these third parties are unable or unwilling to deliver products of acceptable quality or in a timely manner, our ability to bring services to market, the reliability of our services and our reputation could suffer. We expect that it could take several months to effectively transition to new third-party manufacturers or fulfillment agents. We may also decide to switch to or bring on additional contract manufacturers to better meet our needs. Switching to or bringing on a new contract manufacturer and commencing production is expensive and time-consuming and may cause delays in order fulfillment at our existing contract manufacturers or cause other disruptions. 
 Additionally, several components used in our on-premise devices, end-point devices and new products such as Ooma AirDial are single sourced and any interruption in the suppliers of such components or other impacts related to such sole suppliers, such as an increase on tariffs on goods imported from outside the United States, could cause our business and operating results to suffer as we identify and establish alternative sources of components. For example, we have in the past experienced longer lead times in the supply of some of these components as a result of global supply chain disruptions. We are also subject to the risk of shortages (including changes in the prioritization of our orders), price increases and the risk that our suppliers may discontinue or modify components used in our products. The occurrence of other events outside our control, such as public health crises, natural disasters or climate change, could impact our suppliers facilities and component providers, many of which are located in Vietnam and other countries in Asia. Furthermore, the geopolitical and economic uncertainty and/or instability that may result from changes in the relationship among the United States, Taiwan and China and related tensions, may, directly or indirectly, materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, certain of our contract manufacturers and suppliers are dependent on products sourced from Taiwan which has been distinguished in its prevalence in certain global markets. Hence, greater restrictions and/or disruptions of our contract manufacturers suppliers ability to operate facilities and/or do business in and with Taiwan may increase the cost of certain materials and/or limit the supply of products sourced from Taiwan and may result in deterioration of our profit margins, a potential need to increase our pricing and, in so doing, may decrease demand for our products and thereby adversely impact our revenue or profitability. 
 A ransomware attack or other security breach could delay or interrupt service to our customers, compromise the integrity of our systems or data that we collect, result in the loss of our intellectual property or confidential information, harm our reputation, or subject us to significant liability. 
 Our operations depend on our ability to protect our network from interruption or damage resulting from unauthorized access or entry, computer viruses or malware or other events beyond our control, and our ability to detect any such events. In the past, we have been subject to distributed denial-of-service ("DDOS cyberattacks"), and have been subject to other forms of attacks by hackers intent on bringing down our services or accessing confidential information. We may be subject to other DDOS and other forms of attacks in the future, undetected or otherwise. Recent developments in the threat landscape include use of AI and machine learning, as well as an increased number of cyber extortion and ransomware attacks, with higher financial ransom demand amounts and increasing sophistication and variety of ransomware techniques and methodology. For example, the industry has experienced an increase in cyber-attack activity has been observed in connection with Russia s invasion of Ukraine. We cannot assure you that our backup systems, regular data backups, physical, technological and organizational security protocols and measures and other procedures that are currently in place, or that may be in place in the future, will be adequate to detect or prevent unauthorized access to our systems, significant damage, system interruption, degradation or failure, or data loss or to respond to a cyberattack once launched. Additionally, hackers may attempt to directly gain access to a customer's on-premise appliance, or their mobile phone, which may delay or interrupt services, or may subject our customers to further security risks, including in relation to any connected household devices a customer might have now or in the future, such as our connected smart security sensors and our partner's connected devices or to our network more generally. Also, our services are web-based, and the amount of data we store for our users on our servers has been increasing as our business has grown. 
 Despite our ongoing efforts to enhance security measures, our infrastructure and those of third parties we rely upon may be vulnerable to hackers, phishing, computer viruses, worms, ransomware other malicious software programs or similarly disruptive problems caused by our customers, employees, consultants or other internet users who attempt to invade public and private data networks. In some cases, we do not have in place disaster recovery facilities for certain ancillary services, such as email delivery of messages. Currently, a majority of our customers authorize us to bill their credit or debit card accounts directly for all transaction fees that we charge. We rely on encryption and authentication technology to ensure secure transmission of confidential information, including customer credit and debit card numbers. Despite our efforts to encrypt and secure transmission of confidential customer information, hackers with sufficiently sophisticated technology or methods may still be able to infiltrate our systems to gain unauthorized access to payment card information. Further, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology we use to protect transaction data. In addition, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to the information systems change frequently, and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. 
 Ooma | FY2025 Form 10-Q | 33 

Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, consultants or customers into disclosing sensitive information, such as user names, passwords, customer proprietary network information ("CPNI"), intellectual property or other information in order to gain access to our customers' data or to our data. CPNI includes information such as the phone numbers called by a customer, the frequency, duration, and timing of such calls, and any services purchased by the customer, such as call waiting, call forwarding and caller ID, in addition to other information that may appear on a customer's bill. In addition, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, as noted above, due to political uncertainty and military actions associated with Russia s invasion of Ukraine, we and our vendors, business partners, and contractors may also be vulnerable to heightened risks of cyber-attacks, including from or affiliated with nation-state actors, which could materially disrupt our systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute our services and products. Any compromise or perceived compromise of our security could damage our reputation, and could subject us to significant liability, as well as regulatory action, including financial penalties, which would materially adversely affect our brand, results of operations, financial condition, business and prospects. 
 See Risks Related to Security, IT Systems and Intellectual Property for further risks related to security breaches. 
 We rely significantly on retailers and reseller partnerships to sell our products our failure to effectively develop, manage and maintain these sales channels could materially and adversely affect our revenue and business. 
 A significant portion of our Ooma Residential and Ooma Business product sales are made through a combination of direct sales and leading retailers such as Amazon, Costco.com, Best Buy and Walmart, as well as reseller partnerships. Our future success depends on our ability to effectively maintain, develop and expand our retail channel and reseller partnership sales as we seek to grow and expand our customer base. Generally, our agreements with our retailers and reseller partners are not long-term and do not impose minimum sales requirements, and we have in the past and may in the future experience a loss of or reduction in sales through any of these third parties, which could materially reduce our revenue and profit margins. Our competitors may in some cases be effective in causing our current and potential retailers, and reseller partners to favor their services or prevent or reduce sales of our services. If we fail to maintain or develop new relationships with retailers and reseller partners in new markets or expand the number of retailers and reseller partners in existing markets, fail to manage, train, or provide appropriate incentives to our existing retailers and reseller partners, or if they are not successful in their sales efforts, sales of our products and services may decrease and our results of operations would suffer. 
 Our Talkatone application relies significantly on the Apple and Google app stores for distribution. Its future success depends on our continued ability to distribute Talkatone through these app stores and increase its visibility therein. If Apple or Google determine that Talkatone is non-compliant with their app store vendor policies, they may revoke our rights to sell Talkatone through their app store at any time, which could adversely affect our revenue. 
 We face competition in our markets and may lack sufficient financial or other resources to compete successfully. Mergers or other strategic transactions involving our competitors could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and harm our results of operations. 
 The cloud-based communications and connected services industries are highly competitive and we expect that competition will continue to be intense in the future. Increased competition may result in pricing pressures, reduced profit margins and may impede our ability to continue to increase the sales of our services and products or cause us to lose market share, any of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations. We face continued competition from established communications providers, such as Comcast Corporation, Verizon Communications Inc., AT T Inc., Charter Communications Inc. and Rogers Communications Inc.; as well as from traditional on-premise, hardware business communications providers, mobile communications app companies providing over-the-top solutions, large internet companies that offer services with features that compete with some of what we offer, and certain other communications companies. These companies currently or may in the future host their solutions through the cloud. 
 Some of our competitors have been acquired, and may in the future consolidate with or be acquired by, other companies and competitors. Some of our competitors may enter into new alliances with each other or may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with systems integrators, third-party consulting firms or other parties. Any such consolidation, acquisition, alliance or cooperative relationship could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and lead to downward pricing pressure and our loss of market share, and could result in a competitor with greater financial, technical, marketing, service and other resources, all of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Furthermore, increased competition may result in aggressive business and pricing tactics by our competitors, including: offering products similar to our platforms and solutions on a bundled basis at no charge; announcing competing products combined with extensive marketing efforts; providing financial incentives to consumers; and asserting intellectual property 
 Ooma | FY2025 Form 10-Q | 34 

rights irrespective of the validity of the claims. In addition, our retail partners may offer the products and services of competing companies, which would adversely affect our business. Competition from other companies may also adversely affect our negotiations with service providers and suppliers, including, in some cases, requiring us to lower our prices. We may not be able to compete successfully with the offerings and sales tactics of other companies, which could result in the loss of customers and, as a result, our revenue and profitability could be adversely affected. 
 The market for our CPaaS and CCaaS 2600Hz solutions is rapidly evolving, significantly fragmented and highly competitive, with relatively low barriers to entry in some segments. Our competitors in this segment of the market are primarily (i) CPaaS companies that offer communications products and applications, and (ii) other software companies that compete with portions of these and CCaaS solutions. Some of our competitors and potential competitors in this segment are larger and have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more established customer relationships, larger budgets, lower operating costs, and significantly greater resources than we do. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, customer requirements or changing economic conditions. Our competitors may also offer products or services that address one or a limited number of functions at lower prices, with greater depth than our products or in different geographies. Our current and potential competitors may develop and market new products and services with comparable functionality to our products, and this could lead to us having to decrease prices in order to remain competitive. Additionally, in connection with our AirDial product offering, we face competition in the POTS replacement market from a range of other companies, such as Verizon Communications Inc., Granite Telecommunications LLC, MetTel Inc., AT T Inc. and Napco Securities Technologies, Inc., as well as other service providers that bundle their offerings with POTS-related products from POTS replacement equipment manufacturers, such as DataRemote Inc. 
 Our business, operating results and financial condition also depend, in part, on our ability to establish and maintain relationships through resellers, distributors, and strategic partners. A portion of our revenue is derived from sales made by these partners and any one of them may later decide to stop selling our products or to sell their own products or those of third parties that may be competitive with our products. A loss or reduction in sales of our products through these third-party intermediaries could adversely affect our revenue and other results of operations. 
 Ooma | FY2025 Form 10-Q | 35 

We may be exposed to significant risks in connection with our international operations. 
 To date, we have not generated significant revenue from outside of the United States and Canada, but we have expanded operations outside North America to provide services in certain countries internationally. The future success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to expand our operations and customer base worldwide. Operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory, economic and political risks different from those in the United States. Because of our limited experience with international operations and developing and managing sales and distribution channels in international markets, our expansion efforts may not succeed. We face risks in doing business internationally that could materially and adversely affect our business, including: 
 our ability to comply with differing and evolving technical and environmental standards, telecommunications regulations, and certification requirements outside the United States; 

our ability to comply with different and evolving laws, rules, regulations and standards relating to data privacy, data protection, data localization and data security enacted in countries in which we operate or do business; 

potential contractual and other liability to our business partners if we fail to meet their aggressive expansion schedules in new locations; 

difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations; 

potentially greater difficulty collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles; 

the need to adapt and localize our services for specific countries; 

the need to offer customer care in various languages; 

reliance on third parties over which we have limited control for marketing and reselling our services; 

availability of reliable broadband connectivity and wide area networks in targeted areas for expansion; 

lower levels of adoption of credit or debit card usage for internet related purchases by foreign customers and compliance with various foreign regulations related to credit or debit card processing and data privacy; 

difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations, and customs in foreign jurisdictions; 

export controls and trade and economic sanctions administered by the Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security and the Treasury Department s Office of Foreign Assets Control; 

tariffs and other non-tariff barriers, such as quotas and local content rules; 

uncertainty as to the impact of higher tariff rates imposed by the United States on goods from other countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods, including the tariffs implemented and additional tariffs that have been proposed by the U.S. government on various imports from China, Canada, Mexico and the EU, and by the governments of these jurisdictions on certain U.S. goods, and any other possible tariffs that may be imposed on services such as ours, the scope and duration of which, if implemented, remain uncertain; 

compliance with various anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA; 

more limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; 

adverse tax consequences; 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates, economic stability, and inflationary conditions which could increase the price of our services outside of the United States, increase the expenses of our international operations, including expenses related to foreign contractors, and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk; 

exchange control regulations, which might restrict or prohibit our conversion of other currencies into U.S. Dollars; 

restrictions on the transfer of funds; 

international conflict and sanctions, such as those resulting from Russia s ongoing invasion of Ukraine; 

deterioration of political relations between the United States and other countries; and 

political or social unrest or economic instability in a specific country or region, which could have an adverse impact on our third-party software development and quality assurance operations there. 

Failure to manage any of these risks could harm our future international operations and our overall business. 
 Ooma | FY2025 Form 10-Q | 36 

To deliver our services, we rely on third parties for our network connectivity and co location facilities for certain features in our services and for certain elements of providing our services. 
 We expect that we will continue to rely on third-party service providers for hosting, internet access and other services that are vital to our service offering for the foreseeable future. For example, Equinix, Inc. and others provide data center facilities, and Inteliquent and others provide origination services. Inteliquent is also our primary provider of 911 services. We also rely on third-party service providers or are unable to provide for our SMS and speech-to-text services which are sole-sourced. If any of these network service providers stop providing or are unable to provide us with access to their infrastructure, fail to provide these services to us on a cost-effective basis, cease operations, or otherwise terminate these services, the delay caused by qualifying and switching to another third-party network service provider, if one is available, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 We may be required to transfer our servers to new data center facilities if we are unable to renew our leases on acceptable terms, if at all, or the owners of the facilities decide to close their facilities, and we may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with doing so. Any financial difficulties, such as bankruptcy or foreclosure, faced by our third-party data center operators or any of the service providers with which we or they contract, may have negative effects on our business, the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict. Additionally, if our data centers are unable to keep up with our increasing needs for capacity, our ability to grow our business could be materially and adversely impacted. 
 If problems occur with any of these third-party network or service providers for any reason, including cyberattacks, it may cause errors or reduced quality in our services, and we could encounter difficulty identifying the source of the problem. The occurrence of errors or reduced quality in our service, whether caused by our systems or a third-party network or service provider, may result in the loss of our existing customers, delay or loss of market acceptance of our services, termination of our relationships and agreements with our resellers or liability for failure to meet service level agreements, and may seriously harm our business and results of operations. 
 We rely on purchased or leased hardware and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our services. In some cases, we integrate third-party licensed software components into our platforms. For example, we are integrating third-party billing software into our platforms. Failure to integrate such billing platforms could result in increased expenses, errors, and delays. Third-party hardware and software, or future technology we may want to license, may not continue to provide competitive features and functionality or be available to us at reasonable prices or on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our service until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained and integrated. Any errors or defects in third-party hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our service which could harm our business. 
 We also contract with one or more third parties to provide enhanced 911, or E-911, services, including assistance in routing emergency calls and terminating E-911 calls. Our providers operate a national call center that is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to receive certain emergency calls and maintain public service answering point, or PSAP, databases for the purpose of deploying and operating E-911 services. On mobile devices, we generally rely on the underlying cellular or wireless carrier to provide E-911 services. Any failure to perform, including interruptions in service, by our vendors, could cause failures in our customers access to E-911 services and expose us to significant liability and damage our reputation. 
 Interruptions in our software or services could harm our reputation, result in significant costs to us and impair our ability to sell our services. 
 Because our technology platforms are complex, incorporate a variety of new computer hardware, and the platforms continue to evolve, our services may have errors, defects, bugs or other quality or reliability problems that can interfere with their intended operations or the intended operation of the systems in which our software and services are installed, or require updates that are identified after customers begin using such software or services, any of which could result in unanticipated service interruptions. Although we test our services to detect and correct errors, defects, bugs or other quality or reliability problems before shipment or their initial release and before we make updates or other changes to such software or services, we have occasionally experienced significant service interruptions as a result of undetected errors, defects, bugs or other quality or reliability problems and may experience future interruptions of service if we fail to detect and correct the same. There can be no assurance that our pre-shipment or pre-release testing programs will be adequate to detect all such quality or reliability problems. In addition, updates to our hardware and/or software due to changes in third-party service providers may be required from time to time. Furthermore, the costs incurred in correcting root causes for service outages and updating our hardware and/or software may be substantial and these and other related consequences could negatively impact our results of operations. 
 Ooma | FY2025 Form 10-Q | 37 

We currently serve the majority of our customers from data centers in Northern California, Texas and Virginia, where we lease space from Equinix, Inc. We also lease data center space in certain cities in Europe and serve some of our customers from cloud service providers. These facilities and the procedures we have implemented to restore services quickly in the event of a service outage, by themselves, will not prevent future outages. Any damage to, or failure of, these facilities, the communications network providers with whom we or they contract or with the systems by which our communications providers allocate capacity among their customers, including us, could result in interruptions in our service. Additionally, in connection with the expansion or consolidation of our existing data center facilities, we may move or transfer our data and our customers data to other data centers. Despite precautions we take during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair or cause disruptions in the delivery of our service. 
 Despite precautions taken at our hosting facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster, cyberattack, or an act of terrorism or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. Even with the disaster recovery arrangements that we have in place, our service could be interrupted. Any errors, defects, bugs or other quality or reliability problems in, or unavailability of, the components of our platforms that cause interruptions in the intended operation of our software or services, or the intended operation of the systems in which our software or services are installed, could, among other things: cause a reduction in revenue or a delay in market acceptance of our services; require us to issue refunds to our customers or expose us to claims for damages or other legal liability; cause us to lose existing customers and make it more difficult to attract new customers; divert our development resources or require us to make extensive changes to our software, which would increase our expenses and slow innovation; increase our technical support costs; and harm our reputation and brand. 
 We rely on third parties, including third parties located in Russia, for some of our software development, quality assurance and operations, and anticipate we will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. 
 We outsource certain of our software development and design, quality assurance and operations activities to third-party contractors that have employees and consultants in a number of international locations, including Russia. Our dependence on third-party contractors creates numerous risks; in particular, international sanctions imposed as a result of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war could limit our ability to transact with our third-party contractors in Russia, which could disrupt or delay current or future planned research and development activities, increase our costs, or force us to shift development efforts to resources in other geographies that may not possess the same level of cost efficiencies. 
 More generally, there is the risk that we may not maintain control or effective management with respect to these business operations. Our agreements with these third-party contractors are either not terminable by them (other than at the end of the term or upon an uncured breach by us) or require at least 30 days prior written notice of termination. If we experience problems with our third-party contractors, the costs charged by our third-party contractors increase, or our agreements with our third-party contractors are terminated, we may not be able to develop new solutions, enhance or operate existing solutions or provide customer support in an alternate manner that is equally or more efficient and cost-effective. If we are unsuccessful in maintaining existing and, if needed, establishing new relationships with third parties, our ability to efficiently operate existing services or develop new services and provide adequate customer support could be impaired, and as a result, our competitive position or our results of operations could suffer. 
 We rely on third parties to provide the majority of our customer service and support representatives. If these third parties do not provide our customers with reliable, high quality service, our reputation and our business will be harmed, and we may be exposed to significant liability. 
 We offer customer support through both our online account management website and our toll-free customer support number. Our customer support is currently provided via a third-party provider located in the Philippines, as well as our U.S. employees. The ability to support our customers may be disrupted by natural disasters, inclement weather, civil unrest, strikes, terrorism, breaches of data security, and other adverse events. A significant service outage may cause a high volume of customer support inquiries, and our third party customer service center may not be able to respond to such inquiries in a timely manner, which would adversely impact our ability to deliver on our customer commitments. We currently offer support almost exclusively in English. As we have expanded our operations internationally, we have made and will need to continue to make significant expenditures and investments in our customer service and support to adequately address the complex needs of international customers, such as support in multiple foreign languages. Industry consolidation among customer service providers may impact our ability to obtain these services or increase our costs for these services. 
 Ooma | FY2025 Form 10-Q | 38 

If we fail to continue developing our brand or our reputation is harmed, our business may suffer. 
 We believe that continuing to strengthen our current brand will be critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our services and will require continued focus on active marketing efforts. The demand for and cost of online and traditional advertising have been increasing and may continue to increase. Accordingly, we may need to increase our investment in, and devote greater resources to, advertising, marketing, and other efforts to create and maintain brand loyalty among users. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses incurred in building our brands. If we fail to promote and maintain our brand, or if we incur substantial expense in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brands, our business could be materially and adversely affected. 
 Our services, as well as those of our competitors, are regularly reviewed and commented upon by online and social media sources, as well as computer and other business publications. Negative reviews, or reviews in which our competitors products and services are rated more highly than our solutions, could negatively affect our brand and reputation. From time to time, our customers have expressed dissatisfaction with our services, including dissatisfaction with our customer support, our billing policies and the way our services operate. If we do not handle customer complaints effectively, our brand and reputation may suffer, we may lose our customers confidence, and they may choose to terminate, reduce or not to renew their subscriptions. In addition, many of our customers participate in social media and online blogs about internet-based services, including our services, and our success depends in part on our ability to minimize negative and generate positive customer feedback through such online channels where existing and potential customers seek and share information. If actions we take or changes we make to our services do not receive a favorable reception from these customers, their blogging could negatively affect our brand and reputation. Complaints or negative publicity about our services or customer service could materially and adversely impact our ability to attract and retain customers and our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We may not be able to effectively manage our growth and the increased complexity of our business, which could negatively impact our brand, financial performance and increase the risk of investing in our stock. 
 We continue to experience significant growth in our business, including through our expansion domestically and internationally, as well as through our acquisitions of 2600Hz in October 2023 and OnSIP in July 2022. This growth has placed and may continue to place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure. As our operations grow in size, scope and complexity, we will need to increase our sales and marketing efforts and personnel worldwide, and improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to attract, service, and retain an increasing number of users. For example, we expect the volume of simultaneous calls to increase significantly as our user base grows, and our network hardware and software may not be able to accommodate this additional simultaneous call volume. The expansion of our systems and infrastructure will require us to commit substantial financial, operational and technical resources in advance of an increase in the volume of business, with no assurance that the volume of business will increase. Any such additional capital investments will increase our cost base. Continued growth could also strain our ability to maintain reliable service levels for our users, develop and improve our operational, financial and management controls, enhance our reporting systems and procedures and recruit, train, and retain highly skilled personnel. If we fail to achieve the necessary level of efficiency in our organization as we grow, and if the current and future members of our management team do not effectively scale with this growth, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. 
 Our business could suffer if we cannot obtain or retain direct inward dialing numbers ("DIDs"), are prohibited from obtaining local or toll-free numbers, or are limited to distributing local or toll-free numbers to only certain customers. 
 Our future success depends on our ability to procure large quantities of local and toll-free DIDs in the United States and foreign countries in desirable locations at a reasonable cost and without restrictions. Our ability to procure and distribute DIDs depends on factors outside of our control, such as applicable regulations, the practices of the communications carriers that provide DIDs, the cost of these DIDs, and the level of demand for new DIDs. Due to their limited availability, there are certain popular area code prefixes we generally cannot obtain. Our inability to acquire DIDs for our operations would make our services less attractive to potential customers in the affected local geographic areas, which could adversely affect our revenue growth. In addition, future growth in our customer base and the customer bases of our competitors will increase our dependence on needing sufficiently large quantities of DIDs. 
 Ooma | FY2025 Form 10-Q | 39 

If we are unable to effectively process local number and toll-free number portability provisioning in a timely manner, our growth may be negatively affected. 
 We support local number and toll-free number portability, which allows our customers to transfer to us and thereby retain their existing phone numbers when subscribing to our services. During the number transfer process, our new customers must maintain both our service and their existing phone service. We depend on third-party carriers to transfer phone numbers, a process we do not control, and these third-party carriers may refuse or substantially delay the transfer of these numbers to us. Local number portability is considered an important feature by many potential customers, and if we fail to reduce any related delays, we may experience increased difficulty in acquiring new customers. Moreover, the FCC requires us to comply with specified number porting timeframes when customers leave our service for the services of another provider. In Canada, the CRTC has imposed a similar number portability requirement on service providers like us. If we, or our third-party carriers, are unable to process number portability requests within the requisite timeframes, we could be subject to fines and penalties. Additionally, in the United States, both customers and carriers may seek relief from the relevant state public utility commission, the FCC, or in state or federal court for violation of local number portability requirements. 
 We may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future and our rates of growth may decline. 
 We have incurred net losses since our inception, including net losses of approximately 0.8 million in fiscal 2024. We have expended significant resources to develop, market, promote, grow our customer base and sell our products and solutions and we expect to continue investing for future growth. Although we generated cash from operations of 12.3 million for fiscal 2024, we cannot assure you that our operating cash flow will remain positive in the future as we continue to invest in efforts to scale our business. Achieving profitability will require us to increase revenue, manage our cost structure and avoid significant liabilities. Revenue growth and growth of our active user base may slow, revenue may decline or we may incur significant losses in the future for a number of possible reasons, including general macroeconomic conditions, increasing competition (including competitive pricing pressures), our achievement of greater market penetration, a decrease in the growth of the markets in which we compete, or failure for any reason to continue capitalizing on growth opportunities. Additionally, we may encounter unforeseen operating expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, service delivery and quality problems and other unknown factors that may result in losses in future periods. If these losses exceed our expectations or our revenue growth expectations are not met in future periods, investors perceptions of our business may be adversely affected, our financial performance will be harmed and our stock price could be volatile or decline. 
 Our quarterly and annual results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to do so. As a result, we may fail to meet or to exceed the expectations of analysts or investors, which could cause our stock price to fluctuate. 
 Our quarterly and annual results of operations and cash flows, have varied historically from period to period, and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including: 
 fluctuations in demand for, pricing of, or usage of, our products, including due to the effects of global macroeconomic conditions, competition, and differing levels of demand for our products based on changing customer priorities, resources, financial conditions and economic outlook; 

our ability to retain existing customers, resellers, expand our existing customers' user base, and attract new customers, sell premium solutions to our existing customers and introduce new solutions; 

the actions of our competitors, including pricing changes or the introduction of new solutions and products; 

our ability to effectively manage our growth and successfully penetrate the communications and connected services markets for businesses, residential and mobile; 

the number of monthly, annual and multi-year subscriptions at any given time and the timing of recognition of subscription revenue; 

the timing, cost and effectiveness of our advertising and marketing efforts; 

the timing, operating cost and capital expenditures for the operation, maintenance, and expansion of our business; 

delays or disruptions in our supply chain; 

the timing of our decisions with regard to product resource allocation; 

increased component costs; 

seasonality of consumers purchasing patterns and seasonality of advertising patterns; 

service outages or security breaches and any related impact on our reputation; 

Ooma | FY2025 Form 10-Q | 40 

our ability to accurately forecast revenue and appropriately plan our expenses; 

costs associated with defending and resolving intellectual property infringement and other claims; 

changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting rules; 

the timing and cost of developing or acquiring technologies, services or businesses and our ability to successfully manage any such acquisitions; 

how well we execute on our strategy and operating plans and the impact of changes in our business model that could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition; 

the impact of worldwide economic, industry, and market conditions, such as liquidity constraints and higher levels of inflation; and 

quarantines, travel limitations, or business disruptions in regions affecting our operations, including our field sales and installation services teams, or the operations of third parties upon which we rely, stemming from the actual, imminent or perceived outbreaks of epidemics or pandemics. 

Any one of the factors above, or the cumulative effect of some or all of the factors referred to above, may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results of operations and cash flows. This variability and unpredictability could result in our failure to meet our internal operating plan or the expectations of securities analysts or investors for any period, which could cause our stock price to decline. In addition, a significant percentage of our operating expenses is fixed in nature and is based on forecasted revenue trends. Accordingly, in the event of revenue shortfalls, we may not be able to mitigate the negative impact on net income (loss) and margins in the short term. If we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the market price of our shares could fall substantially and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class-action suits. 
 If additional tariffs or other restrictions are placed on our goods imported from other countries, or if the United States were to withdraw from or modify existing trade agreements or regulations, our revenue, gross margin, and results of operations may be materially harmed. 
 Trade restrictions, including tariffs, quotas, embargoes, safeguards and customs restrictions, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of products available to us, or could increase the lead times of certain components and equipment that we may purchase from foreign vendors, have in the past and may in the future require us to modify our supply chain organization or other current business practices, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, President-Elect Trump has indicated that his administration would potentially impose greater restrictions on free trade through significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the United States, particularly from China, where we continue to source certain of our products and components. If such increased or additional tariffs or other restrictions, quotas, embargoes, or safeguards are placed on goods imported into the United States, or any related counter-measures are taken by other countries, we may have to raise our prices or increase inventory levels, or find new sources of system assembly or other products that we import, and our revenue, gross margins, and results of operations may be materially harmed. 
 We are dependent on international trade agreements and regulations, such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMC. If the United States were to withdraw from or materially modify certain international trade agreements or regulations, our business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customer relationships in Canada and other countries could be harmed. 
 Ooma | FY2025 Form 10-Q | 41 

If we do not manage inventory levels and purchase commitments effectively, we may experience excess inventory levels, inventory obsolescence, or inventory shortages that could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Our vendor-supplied on-premise devices and end-point devices, as well as materials and components for new products such as AirDial and enhanced versions of existing products, frequently have lead times of several months or longer for delivery and are built based on our estimates of future demand. If we overestimate our requirements, we may incur liabilities for excess or obsolete inventory, which could negatively affect our gross margins. Conversely, if we underestimate our requirements, our suppliers may have inadequate supplies of the devices or materials and components required to assemble our products, which could result in an interruption of the assembly of our products, delays in shipments or installations and deferral or loss of revenue. Our ability to accurately forecast demand is affected by many factors, including an increase or decrease in customer demand for our products and services, changes in consumer preferences and length of sales cycle, market acceptance of new product and service introductions by us and our competitors, levels of inventory held by channel partners, sales promotional activities by us or our competitors, and unanticipated changes in general market demand and macro-economic conditions. In addition, because we rely on third-party contract manufacturers and other vendors for the supply of our devices and components, our inventory levels are subject to the conditions regarding the timing of purchase orders and delivery dates not within our control. 
 In past periods, we have increased our inventory levels to mitigate supply disruptions caused by component shortages, longer lead times and increased transportation uncertainty. Additionally, we experienced higher unit costs for some products that have been impacted by supply chain constraints and inflationary pressure in the past global macroeconomic environment as well as certain components being subject to end-of-life. We may have to increase inventory levels in the future in anticipation of potential new or increased tariffs on goods imported into the United States. Increased inventory levels have in the past and may in the future result in write-down charges from excess or obsolete inventory, charges from excess purchase commitments, the sale of inventory at discounted prices, and other actions, which may cause our gross margin to decline and harm our reputation and brand. 
 Conversely, insufficient levels of inventory could interrupt the assembly of our products, delay shipments or installations and cause deferral or loss of revenue, any of which may negatively affect relations with customers. For instance, our customers rely upon our ability to meet committed delivery dates, and any disruption in the supply of our services could result in loss of customers or harm to our ability to attract new customers. Additionally, retailers may elect to return any unsold inventory without any penalty, which could result in excess inventory charges. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 We may lose key members of our management team and other key employees, and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth. 
 Our future performance depends on the continued services and contributions of our senior management and other key employees to execute on our business plan, and to identify and pursue opportunities and services innovations. The loss of services of senior management or other key employees could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives. The replacement of any of these senior management personnel would likely involve significant time and costs, and such loss could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives. Many members of our senior management have been our employees for many years and therefore have significant experience and understanding of our business that would be difficult to replace. Our inability to attract and retain the necessary personnel could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of business. We do not maintain key person insurance for any of our personnel. 
 We may not be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, to meet our future capital needs. 
 We intend to continue making expenditures and investments to support the growth of our business. In the future, we may require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and to respond to business opportunities, challenges, or unforeseen circumstances, including the need to develop new solutions or enhance our existing solutions, enhance our operating infrastructure, and acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may decide to engage in equity or debt financings, draw down under our existing credit facility or enter into new credit facilities to secure additional funds. However, additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms acceptable to us, or at all, due to among other factors, general macro-economic conditions, including rising interest rates, volatile credit markets, inflation, and bank defaults or other disruptions in the financial services industry. Any debt financing we secure in the future could contain affirmative and negative covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, including covenants which may limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness and liens, make certain investments, merge or consolidate with other entities and make certain dispositions, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. 
 Ooma | FY2025 Form 10-Q | 42 

If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution. Any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing terms satisfactory to us, our ability to continue pursuing our business objectives and to respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances could be significantly limited, and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be materially and adversely affected, and the trading price of our common stock would likely decline. 
 Our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition. 
 As of October 31, 2024, we had an aggregate of 3.0 million of outstanding indebtedness that will mature in 2026, all of which was incurred under our three-year credit and security agreement Credit Agreement with Citizens Bank, N.A., and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. In addition, as of October 31, 2024, we had 27.0 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement, and from time to time, we may request incremental term loans and/or additional revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to 20.0 million under the Credit Agreement. Our ability to pay interest and repay principal for our level of indebtedness is dependent on our ability to manage our business operations, generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt and the other factors discussed in this section. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. 
 Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following: 
 We may use a portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on the revolving credit facility or any term loans, which will reduce funds available to us for other purposes such as working capital, capital expenditures, other general corporate purposes and potential acquisitions; 

Our ability to refinance such indebtedness or to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired; 

We may be exposed to fluctuations in interest rates because borrowings under our Credit Agreement bears interest at variable rates; 

Our leverage may be greater than that of some of our competitors, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage and reduce our flexibility in responding to current and changing industry and financial market conditions; 

We may be more vulnerable to the current economic downturn and adverse developments in our business; and 

We may be unable to comply with financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt agreements, which could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, may result in acceleration of certain of our debt and would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects and could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. 

Our ability to access additional funding under our revolving credit facility will depend upon, among other things, the absence of a default under such facility, including any default arising from a failure to comply with the related covenants. If we are unable to comply with such covenants, our liquidity may be adversely affected. 
 In addition, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in the Credit Agreement and the terms of our other indebtedness. Our ability to remain in compliance with our covenants under our debt instruments and to make future principal and interest payments in respect of our debt depends on, among other things, our operating performance, competitive developments and financial market conditions, all of which are significantly affected by financial, business, economic and other factors. We are not able to control many of these factors. Accordingly, our cash flow may not be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt, including the notes, and meet our other obligations. 
 Our existing credit agreement imposes operating and financial restrictions on us. 
 The Credit Agreement imposes various operating and financial restrictions on us, including covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain subsidiaries to: 
 Incur additional debt; 

Create liens on certain assets to secure debt; 

Consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; 

Make certain investments or acquisitions or dispositions of assets; 

Enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; 

Ooma | FY2025 Form 10-Q | 43 

Enter into certain swap agreements; 

Pay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments; 

Enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and 

Make certain material amendments to any subordinated debt agreement or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws. 

In addition, we have agreed that we will not permit our recurring revenue or our liquidity to decrease below certain specified levels. All of these covenants may adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, meet or otherwise address our capital needs, pursue business opportunities, react to market conditions or otherwise restrict activities or business plans. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default in respect of the related indebtedness. If a default occurs, our lender could elect to declare the indebtedness, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable and, to the extent such indebtedness is secured in the future, proceed against any collateral securing that indebtedness. 
 Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. Our ability to generate cash will be subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense related to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. Our future cash flow, cash on hand or available borrowings may not be sufficient to meet our obligations and commitments. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service or repay our indebtedness and to meet our other commitments, we will be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness, selling material assets or operations or seeking to raise additional debt or equity capital. These actions may not be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms or at all, or these actions may not enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains, and any of future debt agreements may contain, restrictive covenants that may prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all our debts. 
 Our success depends, in part, on increased acceptance of our connected services, applications and products. 
 Our future growth depends on our ability to significantly increase revenue generated from our Ooma Business and Ooma Residential communications solutions and other connected services. The markets for cloud-based communications and other connected services are evolving rapidly and are characterized by an increasing number of market entrants. If these markets fail to develop, develop more slowly than we anticipate or develop in a manner different than we expect, our services could fail to achieve market acceptance, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our business. 
 Our future growth in the small and medium-sized business and enterprise markets depends on the continued use of voice communications by businesses, as compared to e-mail and other data-based methods. A decline in the overall rate of voice communications by businesses would harm our business. Furthermore, our continued growth depends on future demand for and adoption of internet voice communications systems and services and on future demand for connected communications services. Although the number of broadband subscribers worldwide has grown significantly in recent years, only a small percentage of businesses have adopted internet voice communications services to date. For demand and adoption of internet voice communications services by businesses to increase, internet voice communications networks must improve the quality of their service for real-time communications by managing the effects of and reducing packet loss, packet delay, and packet jitter, as well as unreliable bandwidth, so that high-quality service can be consistently provided. Additionally, the cost and feature benefits of internet voice communications must be sufficient to cause customers to switch from traditional phone service providers. We must devote substantial resources to educate potential customers about the benefits of internet voice communications solutions, in general, and of our services in particular. If any or all of these factors fail to occur, our business may be materially and adversely affected. 
 Our Ooma Residential product and services are sold primarily to individuals and families. With the growth of mobile technologies, many consumers have chosen to eliminate their home telephone service as alternative services have proliferated. Our ability to continue growing our user base depends on our ability to convince customers and potential customers that our service is sufficiently useful and cost-effective, that it makes sense to maintain or establish home telephone services with us over other alternatives. Our growth could slow as it has in recent periods and our financial condition could be adversely affected if the trend of eliminating home telephone service continues or accelerates. 
 Our mobile platform, available to any consumer with a Wi-Fi or cellular data connected mobile device, operates in a market that is fragmented and where it is difficult to gain consumer awareness. Many of our competitors in this market have been able to establish a significant user base and reputation in the market, which may make it more difficult for our products 
 Ooma | FY2025 Form 10-Q | 44 

to be adopted. Furthermore, as new mobile devices are released, we may encounter difficulties supporting these devices and services, and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of our mobile applications. Additionally, our competitors may allocate additional resources to marketing and promotion of their products, making it even more difficult to be noticed. It is also unclear how the adoption of over-the-top based communications will continue to grow. If the number of consumers using over-the-top based communications stagnates or declines, such movement may result in an intensified competition for consumers in this space. 
 Risks Related to Security, IT Systems and Intellectual Property 
 We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant costs to protect against security breaches. We may incur significant additional costs in the future to address any actual or perceived security breaches. 
 Any system failure or security breach that causes interruptions or data loss in our operations or in the computer systems of our customers or leads to the misappropriation of our or our customers' CPNI could result in significant liability to us. Such failure or breach could cause our service to be perceived as not being secure, subject us to regulatory requirements such as FCC notification, result in significant monetary costs, such as fines, legal fees and expenditures to improve and enhance our security measures, cause considerable harm to us and our reputation (including requiring notification to customers, regulators or the media) and deter current and potential customers from using our services. 
 We could incur significant costs, both monetary and with respect to management's time and attention, to investigate and remediate a data security breach. Because our onboarding and billing functions are conducted primarily through a single data center, any security breach in that data center may cause an interruption in our business operations. If any of these events occurs, or is believed to occur, our reputation and brand could be damaged, our business may suffer, we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to alleviate problems caused by such actual or perceived breaches, we could be exposed to a risk of loss, litigation or regulatory action and possible liability, and our ability to operate our business, including our ability to provide maintenance and support services to our channel partners and end-customers, may be impaired. If current or prospective channel partners and end-customers believe that our systems and solutions do not provide adequate security for their businesses' needs, our business and our financial results could be harmed. Actual, potential or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees and engage third-party experts and consultants. 
 Although we maintain privacy, data breach and network security liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, although we have developed an information security program, we cannot guarantee these measures would be sufficient to protect us from a network security incident. Any actual or perceived compromise or breach of our security measures, or those of our third-party service providers, or any unauthorized access to, misuse or misappropriation of personally identifiable information, channel partners' or end-customers information, or other information, could violate applicable laws and regulations, contractual obligations or other legal obligations and cause significant legal and financial exposure, adverse publicity and a loss of confidence in our security measures, any of which could have an material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. 
 Failures in internet infrastructure or interference with broadband access could cause current or potential customers to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading our current customers to switch to our competitors or potential customers to avoid using our services. 
 Many of our services depend on our customers broadband access to the internet, usually provided through a cable or digital subscriber line, or DSL, connection. In addition, users who access our services and applications through mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, must have a high-speed connection, such as Wi-Fi, 3G, 4G, 5G or LTE, to use our services and applications. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant and increasing market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent phone companies, cable companies and wireless companies. Increasing numbers of users and increasing bandwidth requirements may degrade the performance of internet and mobile infrastructure, resulting in outages or deteriorations in connectivity and negatively impacting the quality with which we can deliver our solutions. As our customer base grows and their usage of communications capacity increases, we will be required to make additional investments in network capacity to maintain adequate data transmission speeds, the availability of which may be limited, or the cost of which may be on terms unacceptable to us. If adequate capacity is not available to us as our customers usage increases, our network may be unable to achieve or maintain sufficiently high data transmission capacity, reliability or performance. Furthermore, as the rate of adopting new technologies increases, the networks on which our services and applications rely may not be able to sufficiently adapt to the increased demand for these services, including ours. In the past, we have experienced disruptions to our service and were able to restore service without incurring material expenses. Outages to date have not materially affected our results of operations. 
 Ooma | FY2025 Form 10-Q | 45 

However, the costs incurred in correcting root causes for service outages may be substantial and these and other related consequences could negatively impact our results of operations. 
 Some of the providers of broadband internet access and high-speed mobile access, such as AT T and Verizon, market and sell products and services to our current and potential customers that directly compete with our own offerings, which can potentially give such providers a competitive advantage. Broadband providers also may take measures that affect their customers ability to use our service, such as degrading the quality of the data packets we transmit over their lines, giving those packets low priority, giving other packets higher priority than ours, blocking our packets entirely or attempting to charge their customers more for also using our services. A number of states have enacted or are considering legislation or executive actions that would regulate the conduct of broadband providers. We cannot predict whether state initiatives will be modified, overturned, or vacated by legal action of the court, federal or state legislation, or the FCC. 
 The FCC s orders could affect the market for broadband internet access service in a way that impacts our business, for example by increasing the cost of broadband internet service and thereby depressing demand for our services, by increasing the costs of services we purchase or by creating tiers of internet access service and by either charging us for or prohibiting us from being available through these tiers, and we cannot predict the impact of these events upon our business and results of operations. 
 Frequent or persistent interruptions could cause current or potential users to believe that our systems or services are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our services, and could permanently harm our reputation and brands. Because some of our services rely on integration between features that use both wired and wireless infrastructures, any of the aforementioned problems with either wired or wireless infrastructure may result in the inability of customers to take advantage of our integrated services and therefore may decrease the attractiveness of our collective services to current and potential customers. 
 Ooma | FY2025 Form 10-Q | 46 

If we experience excessive fraudulent activity or cannot meet evolving credit card association merchant standards, we could incur substantial costs and lose the right to accept credit cards for payment, which could cause our customer base to decline significantly. 
 A majority of our customers authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly for service fees that we charge. If people pay for our services with stolen credit cards, we have in the past and may in the future incur substantial third-party vendor costs for which we may not be reimbursed. Further, our customers provide us with credit card billing information online or over the phone, and we do not review the physical credit cards used in these transactions, which increases our risk of exposure to fraudulent activity. We also incur charges, which we refer to as chargebacks, from the credit card companies claims that the customer did not authorize the credit card transaction to purchase our service, something we have experienced in the past. If the number of unauthorized credit card transactions becomes excessive, we could be assessed substantial fines for excess chargebacks and we could lose the right to accept credit cards for payment. We have also been affected by the credit card breaches at various retail stores, which have caused millions of consumers to cancel credit cards as a result of the breach. We have found that some consumers do not renew their services after a card cancellation, which can have a material negative impact on our revenue. In addition, credit card issuers may change merchant standards, including data protection and documentation standards, required to utilize their services from time to time. 
 While Ooma Inc. is currently in compliance with the applicable requirements of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI, certain of Ooma's subsidiaries are currently not in compliance with all of the applicable technical PCI requirements. If we fail to become fully compliant or maintain compliance with current merchant standards, such as PCI, or fail to meet new standards, the credit card associations may fine us or, while unusual, may impose certain restrictions on our ability to accept credit cards or terminate our agreements with them, rendering us unable to accept credit cards as payment for our services. Our services have been in the past, and may also be in the future, subject to fraudulent or abusive usage in violation of applicable law or our acceptable use policies, including but not limited to revenue share fraud, domestic traffic pumping, subscription fraud, premium text message scams, and other fraudulent schemes, any of which could result in our incurring substantial costs for the completion of calls. Although our customers are required to set passwords and Personal Identification Numbers, or PINs, to protect their accounts and may configure in which destinations international calling is enabled from their extensions, third parties have accessed and used our customers accounts and extensions through fraudulent means in the past, and they may do so in the future, which also could result in substantial call completion and other costs for us. In addition, third parties may have attempted in the past, and may attempt in the future, to fraudulently induce employees or consultants into disclosing customer credentials and other account information. Communications fraud can result in unauthorized access to customer accounts and data, unauthorized use of customers services, and charges to customers for fraudulent usage and expenses we must pay to carriers. We may be required to pay for these charges and expenses with no reimbursement from the customer, and our reputation may be harmed if our services are subject to fraudulent usage. 
 Although we have implemented multiple fraud prevention and detection controls, we cannot assure you that these controls will be adequate to protect against fraud. Substantial losses due to fraud or our inability to accept credit card payments, which could cause our paid customer base to significantly decrease, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to grow our business. 
 Accusations of infringement of intellectual property rights could materially and adversely affect our business. 
 There has been substantial litigation in the sectors in which we operate regarding intellectual property rights. In the past, we have been sued by third parties claiming infringement of their intellectual property rights and we were able to settle such litigation. However, we remain subject to infringement lawsuits from time to time, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to settle any such claims or, if we are able to settle any such claims, that the settlement will be on favorable terms. Our broad range of technology in our business may increase the likelihood that third parties will claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights. 
 We have in the past received, and may in the future receive, notices of claims of infringement, misappropriation or misuse of other parties proprietary rights. Notwithstanding their merits, accusations and lawsuits like these often require significant time and expense to defend, may negatively affect customer relationships, may divert management s attention away from other aspects of our operations and, upon resolution, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 Certain technology necessary for us to provide our services may, in fact, be patented by other parties either now or in the future. If such technology were validly patented by another person, we would have to negotiate a license for the use of that technology. We may not be able to negotiate such a license at a price that is acceptable to us or at all. The existence of such a patent, or our inability to negotiate a license for any such technology on acceptable terms, could force us to cease using the technology and cease offering products and services incorporating the technology, which could materially and 
 Ooma | FY2025 Form 10-Q | 47 

adversely affect our business and results of operations. If we were found to be infringing on the intellectual property rights of any third party, we could be subject to liability for such infringement, which could be material. Among other negative consequences, we could also be prohibited from using or selling certain products or services, prohibited from using certain processes, or required to redesign certain products or services, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 Any failure to obtain registration or protection of our intellectual property rights could materially and adversely affect our business. 
 We rely, in part, on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret law to protect our intellectual property in the United States and abroad. We cannot assure you that the particular forms of intellectual property protection we seek, including business decisions about when to file patents and when to maintain trade secrets, will be adequate to protect our business. We seek to protect our technology, software, documentation and other information under trade secret and copyright law, which afford only limited protection. For example, improper disclosure of trade secret information by our current or former employees, consultants, third-party contractors, customers or vendors to the public or others who could make use of the trade secret information would likely preclude that information from being protected as a trade secret. Furthermore, any use of AI tools to create content or code that may be incorporated into our products or services may also impact our ability to obtain or successfully defend certain intellectual property rights. 
 We cannot predict whether our pending patent applications will result in issued patents or whether any issued patents will effectively protect our intellectual property. Even if a pending patent application results in an issued patent, the patent may be circumvented or its validity may be challenged in various proceedings in U.S. District Court, before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or before their foreign equivalents, such as reexamination, which may require legal representation and involve substantial costs and diversion of management time and resources. In addition, we cannot assure you that every significant feature of our solutions is protected by our patents, or that we will mark our products with any or all patents they embody. As a result, we may be prevented from seeking damages in whole or in part for infringement of our patents. 
 The unlicensed use of our brand, including domain names, by third parties could harm our reputation, cause confusion among our customers and impair our ability to market our products and services. Though we have registered numerous trademarks and service marks, have applied for registration of additional trademarks and service marks and have acquired a number of domain names in and outside the United States, if our applications receive objections or are successfully opposed by third parties, it will be difficult for us to prevent third parties from using our brand without our permission. Moreover, successful opposition to our applications might encourage third parties to make additional oppositions or commence trademark infringement proceedings against us, which could be costly and time consuming to defend against. There have been in the past, and may be in the future, instances where third parties have used our trade names, or have adopted confusingly similar trade names to ours. If we are not successful in protecting our trademarks, our trademark rights may be diluted and subject to challenge or invalidation, which could materially and adversely affect our brand. 
 We may not be able to protect or enforce our proprietary rights in the United States or internationally. We typically enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, third-party contractors (including contractors located in Russia and the Philippines), customers and vendors in an effort to control access to use and distribution of our technology, software, documentation and other information. These agreements may not effectively prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of such unauthorized use or disclosure, and it may be possible for a third party to legally reverse engineer, copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization. In addition, such agreements may not adequately protect our proprietary rights in foreign countries, where effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited. Our competitors may independently develop technologies similar or superior to our technology, duplicate our technology in a manner that does not infringe our intellectual property rights or design around any of our patents. Furthermore, detecting and policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and resource-intensive. Moreover, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Such litigation, whether successful or not, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management time and resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Ooma | FY2025 Form 10-Q | 48 

Potential problems with our information systems could interfere with our business and operations. 
 We rely on our information systems and those of third parties for processing customer orders, distribution of our services, billing our customers, processing credit card transactions, customer relationship management, supporting financial planning and analysis, accounting functions and financial statement preparation and otherwise running our business. Information systems may experience interruptions, including interruptions of related services from third-party providers, which may be beyond our control. Such business interruptions could cause us to fail to meet customer requirements. All information systems, both internal and external, are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including without limitation, computer viruses, ransomware attacks or other security breaches, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures, and employee or other theft, as well as third-party provider failures. Any disruption in our information systems and those of the third parties upon which we rely could have a significant impact on our business. 
 We may implement enhanced information systems in the future to meet the demands resulting from our growth and to provide additional capabilities and functionality. The implementation of new systems could come with its own set of cybersecurity risks. The implementation of new systems and enhancements to existing systems is frequently disruptive to the underlying business of an enterprise, and can be time-consuming and expensive, increase management responsibilities and divert management attention. Any disruptions relating to our systems enhancements or any problems with the implementation, particularly any disruptions impacting our operations or our ability to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis during the implementation period, could materially and adversely affect our business. Even if we do not encounter these material and adverse effects, the implementation of these enhancements may be much costlier than we anticipated. If we are unable to successfully implement the information systems enhancements as planned, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. 
 Our use of open source technology could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our services. 
 We use open source software in our platforms on which our services operate. There is a risk that the owners of the copyrights in such software may claim that such licenses impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market or provide our services. If such owners prevail in such claim, we could be required to make the source code for our proprietary software (which contains our valuable trade secrets) generally available to third parties, including competitors, at no cost, to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our services, to re-engineer our technology, or to discontinue offering our services in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or at all, any of which could cause us to discontinue our services, harm our reputation, result in customer losses or claims, increase our costs or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. If a copyright holder of such open source software were to allege we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from the sale of our solutions that contained the open source software and required to comply with the foregoing conditions, which could disrupt the distribution and sale of some of our solutions. 
 Regulatory and Tax Matters 
 Our services are subject to regulation and future legislative or regulatory actions could adversely affect our business and expose us to liability. 
 Federal Regulation. Our business is regulated by the FCC. As a communication services provider, we are subject to FCC regulations relating to privacy, disability access, law enforcement access, porting of numbers, revenue reporting, Federal USF contributions and other regulatory assessments, E 911, robocall mitigation, and other matters. If we do not comply with FCC rules and regulations, we could be subject to FCC enforcement actions, substantial fines, loss of licenses, repayment of funds, potential private right of actions and possibly restrictions on our ability to operate or offer certain of our services. Any enforcement action by the FCC, which may include a public process, would hurt our reputation in the industry, possibly impair our ability to sell our services to customers and could have a materially adverse impact on our revenue. 
 State Regulation. We are also subject to state consumer protection laws, as well as U.S. state, municipal and local sales, use, excise, utility user and ad valorem taxes, fees or surcharges. The imposition of such regulatory obligations or the imposition of additional taxes on our services could increase our cost of doing business and limit our growth. 
 International Regulation. Our international operations subject us to telecommunications, consumer protection, data privacy and other laws and regulations in the foreign countries where we offer our services. Our international operations are potentially subject to country-specific governmental regulation and related actions that may increase our costs and prevent us from offering or providing our products and services in certain countries. Certain of our services may be used by customers located in countries where VoIP and other forms of IP communications may be illegal or require special licensing. In countries where local laws and regulations prohibit (or come to prohibit) the use of our products, users may continue to 
 Ooma | FY2025 Form 10-Q | 49 

use our products and services, which could subject us to costly penalties or governmental action adverse to our business and damaging to our brand and reputation, our international expansion efforts, or our business and operating results. 
 The adoption of additional 911 requirements by the FCC could increase our costs that could make our service more expensive, decrease our profit margins, or both. 
 We may not be able to comply with additional 911 requirements adopted by the FCC for interconnected VoIP providers, providers of enterprise telephone services, non-interconnected VoIP providers and texting providers. For example, beginning January 6, 2022, providers of non-fixed interconnected VoIP services were required to supply automated dispatchable location, if technically feasible, or either registered location information obtained by the customer or alternative location information. At present, we have no means to automatically identify the physical location of our customers. Our obligation to comply with the FCC s VoIP E-911 order and related costs puts us at a competitive disadvantage to VoIP service providers who are either not subject to the requirements or have chosen not to comply with the FCC s mandates. We cannot guarantee emergency calling service consistent with the VoIP E-911 order will be available to all of our customers, especially those accessing our services on a mobile device or from outside of the United States. The FCC s current E-911 requirements and changes to those requirements, including their impact on our customers due to service price increases or other factors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. In addition, customers may attempt to hold us responsible for any loss, damage, personal injury, or death suffered as a result of delayed, misrouted, or uncompleted emergency service calls or text messages, subject to any limitations on a provider's liability provided by applicable laws, regulations, and our customer agreements. 
 If we cannot comply with the FCC's rules imposing call signaling requirements on VoIP providers, we may be subject to fines, cease and desist orders, or other penalties. 
 The FCC s rules regarding the system of compensation for various types of traffic require, among other things, interconnected VoIP providers who originate interstate or intrastate traffic destined for the PSTN, to transmit the telephone number associated with the calling party to the next provider in the call path. Intermediate providers must pass unaltered calling party number or charge number signaling information they receive from other providers to subsequent providers in the call path. In addition, effective June 30, 2021, voice service providers in the United States were required to either fully implement STIR/SHAKEN technology on their entire networks or implement a robocall mitigation program on those portions of their networks that are not STIR/SHAKEN-enabled. Canada is also currently in the process of implementing STIR/SHAKEN requirements. Although we have implemented STIR/SHAKEN in the United States and are in the process of implementing STIR/SHAKEN in Canada, to the extent that we inadvertently pass traffic that does not have appropriate calling party number or charge number information, we could be subject to fines, cease and desist orders, or other penalties. Similarly, to the extent that we cannot authenticate our customers, their traffic may be more likely to be blocked or adversely labeled. Additionally, as a VoIP provider, we rely on the FCC to design rules that do not disadvantage our service relative to those of incumbent local exchange carriers and competitive local exchange carriers. Should the FCC decide to do so, it could result in an inferior user experience for Ooma s service, which may negatively impact our business. 
 We may not be able to comply with FCC rules governing completion of calls to rural areas and related reporting requirements. 
 The FCC s rules governing the completion of calls to rural areas and related reporting requirements require us, among other things, to monitor the performance of our intermediate providers telecom companies we use to help complete telephone calls to rural areas and take steps to prevent rural call completion problems that may be caused by our intermediate providers, such as persistent low answer or completion rates, unexplained anomalies in performance, or repeated complaints to the FCC. Under certain circumstances, if our routing choices, meaning the intermediate providers we chose to help us complete calls to rural areas, result in lower quality service, we may be held liable for the actions taken by our intermediate providers. If we cannot comply with these rules, we could be subject to investigation and enforcement action and could be exposed to substantial liability. The FCC also has increased enforcement activity related to completion of calls to rural customers, and we could be subject to substantial fines and to conduct requirements that could increase our costs if we are the subject of an enforcement proceeding and cannot demonstrate calls from our customers to rural customers are completed at a satisfactory rate. 
 Failure to comply with communications and telemarketing laws could result in significant fines or place significant restrictions on our business. 
 We rely on a variety of marketing techniques in connection with our sales efforts, including telemarketing and email marketing campaigns. We also record certain telephone calls between our customers or potential customers and our sales and service representatives for training and quality assurance purposes. These activities are subject to a variety of state and federal laws such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (also known as the Federal Do-Not-Call law, or the TCPA), the Telemarketing Sales Rule, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 
 Ooma | FY2025 Form 10-Q | 50 

2003 (also known as the CAN-SPAM Act) and various U.S. state laws regarding telemarketing and telephone call recording. The FCC continues to adopt and consider additional rules related to robocalling, robotexting, and autodialing. For example, in December 2023, the FCC adopted a one-to-one consent rule requiring companies to obtain consent from consumers to receive automated or robotic calls or texts only from one specific good or service provider at a time. These laws are subject to varying interpretations by courts and governmental authorities and often require subjective interpretation, making it difficult to predict their application and therefore making our compliance efforts more challenging. We cannot be certain our efforts to comply with these laws, rules and regulations will be successful, or, if they are successful, that the cost of such compliance will not be material to our business. Changes to these or similar laws, or to their application or interpretation, or new laws, rules and regulations governing our communication and marketing activities could adversely affect our business. In the event that any of these laws, rules or regulations significantly restrict our business, we may not be able to develop adequate alternative communication and marketing strategies. Further, non-compliance with these laws, rules and regulations carries significant financial penalties and the risk of class action litigation, which would adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our reputation and our business. 
 The FCC has continued to increase regulation of interconnected VoIP services and may at any time determine certain VoIP services are telecommunications services subject to traditional common carrier regulation. 
 The FCC is considering, in various proceedings, issues arising from the transition from traditional copper networks to IP networks. The FCC is also considering whether interconnected VoIP services should be treated as telecommunications services, which could subject interconnected VoIP services to additional common carrier regulation. The FCC s efforts may result in additional regulation of IP network and service providers, which may negatively affect our business. 
 Ooma | FY2025 Form 10-Q | 51 

Reform of federal and state Universal Service Fund ("USF") programs could increase the cost of our service to our customers, diminishing or eliminating our pricing advantage. 
 The FCC and a number of states are considering modifications to USF programs, including the manner in which companies, like us, contribute to the federal USF program, and whether certain non-interconnected VoIP providers and broadband providers, among others, should contribute to the USF. If the FCC or certain states modify contribution obligations that continue to increase our contribution burden, we will either need to absorb the increased costs or raise the amount we currently collect from some of our customers to cover these obligations, which would either reduce our profit margins or diminish our price advantage. A number of states require us to contribute funds to state USF programs, while others are actively considering extending their programs to include the services we provide. We currently charge our customers certain fees and other surcharges, which may result in our services becoming less competitive as compared to those provided by others. If our pricing advantage is diminished or eliminated, or if we are required to absorb these increased costs and not pass-through to our customers, our results of operations would be negatively impacted. 
 Our products must comply with industry standards, FCC regulations, state, local, country specific and international regulations, and changes may require us to modify existing products and/or services. 
 In addition to reliability and quality standards, the market acceptance of telephony over broadband IP networks is dependent upon the adoption of industry standards so that products from multiple manufacturers are able to communicate with each other. Our unique hybrid SaaS connectivity platforms rely on communication standards such as SIP, SRTP and network standards such as TCP/IP and UDP to interoperate with other vendors equipment. There is currently a lack of agreement among industry leaders about which standard should be used for a particular application and about the definition of the standards themselves. We also must comply with certain rules and regulations of the FCC regarding electromagnetic radiation and safety standards established by Underwriters Laboratories UL ), as well as similar regulations and standards applicable in other countries. In addition, the market acceptance of POTS replacement products such as Ooma AirDial will depend on compliance with industry standards such as National Fire Protection Association NFPA 72, UL 864 and American Society of Mechanical Engineers ASME A17.1B. As standards evolve, we may be required to modify our existing products or develop and support new versions of our products. We must comply with certain federal, state and local requirements regarding how we interact with our customers, including marketing practices, consumer protection, privacy, and billing issues, the provision of 9-1-1 emergency service and the quality of service we provide to our customers. The failure of our products and services to comply, or delays in compliance, with various existing and evolving standards could delay or interrupt volume production of our VoIP telephony products, subject us to fines or other imposed penalties, or harm the perception and adoption rates of our service, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. 
 We process, store, and use personal information and other data, which subjects us and our customers to a variety of evolving industry standards, contractual obligations and other legal rules related to privacy, which may increase our costs, decrease adoption and use of our products and services, and expose us to liability. 
 There are numerous U.S. federal, state and local, and foreign laws and regulations, as well as contractual obligations and industry standards, that provide for certain obligations and restrictions with respect to data privacy and security, and the collection, storage, retention, protection, use, processing, transmission, sharing, disclosure, and protection Processing of personal information and other customer data. The scope of these obligations and restrictions is changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions or conflict with other rules, and their status remains uncertain. 
 In the United States and in other jurisdictions, a variety of regulations are currently being proposed that would increase restrictions on online service providers in the field of data privacy and security, and we believe that the adoption of such increasingly restrictive regulation is likely. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (the CCPA regulates the processing of personal data, which could result in civil penalties for violations. In addition, the California Privacy Rights Act CPRA took effect on January 1, 2023 and an increasing number of states are adopting similar privacy laws. We will continue to monitor developments related to new privacy laws like the CPRA which will require us to incur additional costs and expenses in an effort to monitor and comply with such laws. 
 In Canada, penalties for non-compliance with certain Canadian anti-spam legislation are considerable, including administrative monetary penalties of up to 10 million and a private right of action. 
 Ooma | FY2025 Form 10-Q | 52 

The EU has implemented strict laws that apply in connection with the Processing of personal information, and other customer data. Data protection regulators within the EU and other jurisdictions have the power to fine non-compliant organizations significant amounts and seek injunctive relief, including the cessation of certain data processing activities. For example, the EU s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, provides for significant penalties for violations, including fines of up to 4 of the violating company s worldwide revenue. While the United Kingdom s Data Protection Act substantially implements the GDPR, the United Kingdom s exit from the European Union has created regulatory uncertainty, including the cross-border transfer of data. Such uncertainty may adversely impact the operations of our U.K. subsidiary by adding operational complexities and expenses. In addition, there is uncertainty about data transfer to the United States. For example, although the new U.S. Data Privacy Framework was formally approved by the European Commission in July 2023, the framework may still be invalidated by the Court of Justice of the European Union, which invalidated the framework's predecessor, the Privacy Shield Program, in 2020. 
 We have taken administrative, contractual and other measures designed to achieve compliance with applicable privacy laws and standards, but we cannot guarantee these measures are sufficient. Obligations and restrictions imposed by current and future applicable laws, regulations, contracts and industry standards, in particular as we continue to expand our international operations, may increase the cost of our operations, affect our ability to provide all the current features of our business, residential and mobile products and services and our customers ability to use our products and services, and could require us to modify the features and functionality of our products and services. Such obligations and restrictions may limit our ability to Process data, and to allow our customers to Process data with others through our products and services. Failure to comply with such obligations could subject us to lawsuits, fines, criminal penalties, statutory damages, consent decrees, injunctions, adverse publicity and other losses that could harm our business. 
 Our customers may use our services to transmit and store protected health information, or PHI, that is protected under HIPAA. Noncompliance with laws and regulations relating to privacy such as HIPAA may lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities. Our actual compliance, our customers perception of our compliance, costs of compliance with such regulations and customer concerns regarding their own compliance obligations (whether factual or in error) may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand. Furthermore, privacy concerns, including the inability or impracticality of providing advance notice to customers of privacy issues related to the use of our services, may cause our customers customers to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our service in certain industries. 
 In addition to government activity, privacy advocacy groups and industry groups have adopted and are considering the adoption of various self-regulatory standards and codes of conduct that may place additional burdens on us and our customers, which may further reduce demand for our services and harm our business. Our employees and personnel may also use generative AI technologies to perform their work, and the disclosure and use of personal information in such technologies is subject to various data privacy and security laws and obligations. Governments have passed and are likely to pass additional laws regulating generative AI. Our use of this technology could result in additional compliance costs and regulatory investigations and actions. If we are unable to use generative AI, it could make our business less efficient and result in competitive disadvantages. 
 
 Any failure by us to protect our users privacy and data, including as a result of our systems being compromised by hacking or other malicious activity, could result in a loss of user confidence in our services and ultimately in a loss of users, which could materially and adversely affect our business. Our customers may also accidentally disclose their passwords, store them on a mobile device that is lost or stolen, or otherwise fall prey to attacks outside our system, creating the perception that our systems are not secure against third-party access. If our third-party contractors or vendors violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations may also put our customers information at risk and could in turn have a material and adverse effect on our business. 
 Use or delivery of our services may become subject to new or increased regulatory requirements, taxes or fees. 
 The increasing growth and popularity of internet voice communications heighten the risk that governments will regulate or impose new or increased fees or taxes on internet voice communications services. To the extent the use of our services continues to grow, regulators may be more likely to seek to regulate or impose new or additional taxes, surcharges or fees on our services. Similarly, advances in technology, such as improvements in locating the geographic origin of internet voice communications, could cause our services to become subject to additional regulations, fees or taxes, or could require us to invest in or develop new technologies, which may be costly. In addition, as we continue to expand our user base and offer more services, we may become subject to new regulations, taxes, surcharges or fees. Increased regulatory requirements, taxes, surcharges or fees on internet voice communications services, which could be assessed by governments retroactively or prospectively, would substantially increase our costs, and, as a result, our business would suffer. In addition, the tax status of our services could subject us to conflicting taxation requirements and complexity with regard to the collection and remittance of applicable taxes. Any such additional taxes could harm our results of operations. 
 Ooma | FY2025 Form 10-Q | 53 

We are subject to anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws with respect to our operations and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal and/or civil liability and harm our business. 
 We are subject to the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and other anti-bribery and anti money laundering laws in countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or private sector. We use third-party representatives for product testing, customs, export, and import matters outside of the United States. As we increase our international sales and business, we may engage with business partners and third-party intermediaries to sell our products and services. We or our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. 
 While we devote resources to our U.S. and international compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments, such as controls over expenditures for foreign contractors, and collusive activity, our employees, partners, vendors, or agents may violate our policies. Noncompliance with anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension and/or debarment from contracting with certain persons, the loss of export privileges, reputational harm, adverse media coverage, and other collateral consequences. If any subpoenas or investigations are launched, or governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management s attention and resources, significant defense costs and other professional fees. Enforcement actions and sanctions could further harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 We are subject to governmental sanctions and export and import controls, economic embargoes and trade sanctions that could impair our ability to expand our business to, and compete in, international markets and could subject us to liability if we are not in compliance with applicable laws. 
 Our products and services are subject to export and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations, and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department s Office of Foreign Assets Controls. U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions programs generally prohibit the export of certain products and services to countries, governments and persons subject to U.S. economic embargoes and trade sanctions unless a license, approval, or other authorization is obtained from the U.S. Government. Obtaining the necessary authorizations and licenses for a particular sale may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export or import privileges, government investigations, reputational harm, fines which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers, and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers. 
 In addition, any changes in our products or services, or changes in applicable export, import, embargo and trade sanctions regulations, may create delays in the introduction and sale of our products and services in international markets or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products and services to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether. Any change in export, import, embargo, or trade sanctions regulations, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could also result in decreased use of our products and services, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products and services to existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our products and services or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products and services would likely adversely affect our business. 
 Ooma | FY2025 Form 10-Q | 54 

We may be subject to liabilities on past services for taxes, surcharges and fees. 
 We collect and remit state or municipal sales, use, excise, utility user and ad valorem taxes, fees, or surcharges on the charges to our customers for our services or goods in only those jurisdictions where we believe we have a legal obligation to do so or for business reasons to reduce risk. In addition, we have historically substantially complied with the collection of certain California sales/use taxes and financial contributions to the California 9-1-1 system (the Emergency Telephone Users Surcharge) and federal USF. With limited exception, we believe we are generally not subject to taxes, fees, or surcharges imposed by other state and municipal jurisdictions or that such taxes, fees, or surcharges do not apply to our services. There is uncertainty as to what constitutes sufficient in state presence for a state or local municipality to levy taxes, fees and surcharges for sales made over the internet. Taxing authorities have in the past, and likely will in the future, challenge our position on the lack of enforceability of such taxes, fees and surcharges where we have no relevant presence, and audit our business and operations with respect to sales, use, telecommunications and other taxes, which could result in increased tax liabilities for us or our customers, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our relationships with our customers. Finally, the application of other indirect taxes (such as sales and use tax, value added tax, or VAT, goods and services tax, business tax, and gross receipt tax) to e-commerce businesses, such as ours, is a complex and evolving area. The application of existing, new, or future laws, whether in the United States or internationally, could have adverse effects on our business, prospects, and results of operations. There have been, and will continue to be, substantial ongoing costs associated with complying with the various indirect tax requirements in the numerous markets in which we conduct or will conduct business. 
 Changes in effective tax rates, or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including: 
 changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; 

expiration of, or lapses in, the research and development tax credit laws; 

expiration or non-utilization of net operating loss carryforwards; 

tax effects of share-based compensation; 

certain non-deductible expenses as a result of acquisitions; 

expansion into new jurisdictions; 

potential challenges to and costs related to implementation and ongoing operation of our intercompany arrangements; and 

changes in tax laws and regulations and accounting principles, or interpretations or applications thereof. 

Our international operations are subject to U.S. tax laws, including limitations on the ability to defer U.S. taxation on earnings outside of the United States until those earnings are repatriated to the United States could affect the tax treatment of our foreign earnings. Any changes in our effective tax rate could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 We may be unable to use some or all of our net operating loss carryforwards, which could materially and adversely affect our reported financial condition and results of operations. 
 As of January 31, 2024, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 47.7 million available to offset future income, of which approximately 5.8 million will expire in various amounts beginning in fiscal 2038, if not utilized, and the remainder may be carried forward indefinitely. We also had state net operating loss carryforwards of 70.7 million which will expire in various amounts beginning in fiscal 2025. Additionally, we have federal and research and development tax credit carryforwards that will begin to expire in fiscal 2030 and California research and development tax credit carryforwards with no expiration date. Realization of these net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards depends on future income, and there is a risk that our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. No deferred tax assets have been recognized on our balance sheet related to these NOLs, as they are fully reserved by a valuation allowance. If we have previously had, or have in the future, one or more Section 382 ownership changes , or if we do not generate sufficient taxable income, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of our NOLs, even if we achieve profitability. If we are limited in our ability to use our NOLs in future years in which we have taxable income, we will pay more taxes than if we were able to fully utilize our NOLs. This could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Ooma | FY2025 Form 10-Q | 55 

Risks Related to Being a Public Company 
 If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock. 
 Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to make a formal assessment and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly, and place significant demands on our financial and operational resources, as well as IT systems. Our control environment may not be sufficient to remediate or prevent future material weaknesses or significant deficiencies from occurring. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and all instances of fraud will be detected. 
 Our independent registered public accounting firm is required to and has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2024. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and reliability of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our common stock to decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities, including the SEC and the NYSE. 
 Our actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance. 
 From time to time, we plan to release earnings guidance in our quarterly earnings conference calls, quarterly earnings releases, or otherwise, regarding our future performance that represents our management s estimates as of the date of release. This guidance, which will include forward looking statements, will be based on projections prepared by our management. Projections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. We intend to state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to imply that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. The principal reason that we release guidance is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. Accordingly, we do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such third parties. 
 Guidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release. Actual results may vary from our guidance and the variations may be material. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged not to rely upon our guidance in making an investment decision regarding our common stock. 
 Any failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this Risk Factors section in this report could result in the actual operating results being different from our guidance, and the differences may be adverse and material. 
 Ooma | FY2025 Form 10-Q | 56 

Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock 
 Our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile, or may fluctuate or decline, resulting in a substantial loss of your investment. 
 Our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, such as quarterly operating results; changes in our financial projections provided to the public or our failure to meet those projections; our operating and financial performance and prospects and the performance of other similar companies; the public's reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC; significant transactions, or new features, products or services by us or our competitors; changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts; failure of securities analysts to cover or track our common stock; media coverage of our business and financial performance; trends in our industry; any significant change in our management; sales of common stock by us, our investors or members of our management team; and changes in general market, economic and political conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including as a result of public health crises and global conflicts, such Russia s ongoing invasion of Ukraine. 
 The market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to, among other things, the factors described in this Risk Factors section or otherwise, and other factors beyond our control, such as fluctuations in the valuations of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us. In addition, the stock market in general, and the market prices for companies in our industry, have experienced volatility that often has been unrelated to operating performance. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, many companies that have experienced volatility in their stock price have become subject to securities class action litigation. We have been subject to this type of litigation in the past and may continue to be a target in the future. Securities litigation against us has resulted and could result in substantial costs and has and would divert our management s attention from other business concerns, any of which could harm our business. 
 If we fail to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, or other market expectations, our stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention. 
 Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception these sales might occur, could cause our stock price to decline. 
 Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception these sales might occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. In addition, we have registered shares of common stock which we may issue under our employee stock plans and they may be sold freely in the public market upon issuance. We may issue our shares of common stock or securities convertible into our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, and investments or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. 
 If securities analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about our business or if they publish negative evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline. 
 We expect that the trading price for our common stock will be affected by any research or reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who elect to cover us downgrade their evaluations of our stock or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company, our stock may lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause its price to decline. 
 We have never paid cash dividends and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock. 
 We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. If we do not pay cash dividends, you would receive a return on your investment in our common stock only if the market price of our common stock increases before you sell your shares. 
 Ooma | FY2025 Form 10-Q | 57 

Our charter documents and Delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our stock. 
 Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions include: 
 providing for a classified board of directors with staggered, three-year terms; 

authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board of directors could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares to discourage a takeover attempt; 

prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors; 

providing that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum; 

prohibiting stockholder action by written consent; 

limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders; and 

requiring advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals. 

These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time without the consent of our board of directors. These and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and result in the market price of our common stock being lower than it would be without these provisions. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. While the Delaware Supreme Court determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring such a claim arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, against us, our directors, officers, or other employees in a venue other than in the federal district courts of the United States. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, and this may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions. 
 Ooma | FY2025 Form 10-Q | 58 

We were and are currently subject to a class action litigation, and may be subject to other litigation in the future. 
 The Company, its directors, and certain officers were named as defendants in a consolidated securities class action in connection with its initial public offering, and in October 2019, the Court dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice. In addition, in February 2021 the Company and Ooma Canada Inc. were named as defendants in a class action complaint in the Federal Court of Canada, alleging violations of Canada s Trademarks Act and Competition Act. In the future, especially following periods of volatility in the market price of our shares, additional purported class action or derivative complaints may be filed against us. The outcome of any pending and potential future litigation is difficult to predict and quantify and the defense of such claims or actions can be costly. In addition to diverting financial and management resources and general business disruption, we may suffer from adverse publicity that could harm our brand or reputation, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately held liable. A judgment or settlement that is not covered by or is significantly in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims, or our obligations to indemnify the underwriters and the individual defendants, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 General Risk Factors 
 If we are unable to hire, retain and motivate qualified personnel, our business will suffer. 
 Our future growth and success depends, in part, on our continued ability to hire and retain highly skilled personnel. We believe there is, and will continue to be, intense competition for highly skilled technical, sales and other personnel with experience in our industry in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters is located, and in other parts of the United States and Canada. We have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, challenges in hiring and retaining skilled personnel with appropriate qualifications. We must provide competitive compensation packages and a high-quality work environment to hire, retain and motivate employees. If we and/or our partners are unable to hire, retain and motivate the existing workforce or attract qualified personnel to fill key positions, we may be unable to manage our business effectively, including the development, marketing and sale of existing and new services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. To the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations such personnel have been improperly solicited or divulged proprietary or other confidential information. 
 The impact of COVID-19 outbreaks or any future global health crisis or pandemics could disrupt and cause harm to our business, operating results, or financial condition. 
 COVID-19 outbreaks or the occurrence of any other global health crisis or pandemic could result in suspending travel and restrict the ability of do business in person, which could impact our sales and marketing efforts and our ability to attract new customers and successfully implement our services in a timely manner. In addition, COVID-19 or any future global health crisis or pandemic could disrupt the operations of our customers, partners, contract manufacturers, suppliers and other third-party providers. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively and if the macroeconomic conditions of the general economy or the industry in which we operate do not improve, or worsen from present levels, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. 
 Catastrophic events or political instability could disrupt and cause harm to our business, operating results, or financial condition. 
 Our corporate headquarters, offices, warehouses and one of our data center facilities are located in Northern California, a region that frequently experiences earthquakes. We also maintain an office in Boca Raton, Florida, an area that is prone to severe weather events, such as hurricanes. In addition, our third-party contract manufacturer facilities in Vietnam and other Asian countries and our sole third-party customer service and support facility in the Philippines are located on the Pacific Rim near known earthquake fault zones that are vulnerable to damage from earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions and/or typhoons. We and our contractors are also vulnerable to other types of disasters, such as power loss, fire, floods, pandemics, cyber-attack, war (including ongoing geopolitical tensions related to Russia s actions in Ukraine, resulting sanctions imposed by the United States and other countries, and retaliatory actions taken by Russia in response to such sanctions), political or civil unrest and terrorist attacks and similar events that are beyond our control. In particular, we depend on third-party contractors located in Russia for engineering and software development services. We cannot assure you that our ability to continue transacting with third-party contractors in Russia would not be impacted by the effects of Russia s ongoing invasion of Ukraine and resulting international sanctions. If any disasters were to occur, our ability to operate our business could be seriously impaired, and we may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, loss of intellectual property, delays in our services development, lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security and loss of critical data, all of which could harm our future results of operations. Such events may also reduce demand for our products and services because of reduced global or national economic activity and can cause disruptions and extreme volatility in global financial markets, increase rates of default and bankruptcy, and impact levels of business and consumer spending. In addition, we do not carry earthquake insurance and we may not have adequate insurance to cover our losses 
 Ooma | FY2025 Form 10-Q | 59 

resulting from other disasters or other similar significant business interruptions. Any significant losses not recoverable under our insurance policies could seriously impair our business and financial condition. 
 Climate change may have an impact on our business. 
 Any of our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. For example, our offices and facilities in California have experienced, and are projected to continue to experience, climate-related events at an increasing frequency, including drought, heat waves, wildfires and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention. Changing market dynamics, global policy developments and the increasing frequency and impact of extreme weather events on critical infrastructure in the U.S. and elsewhere have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-party suppliers and our customers, and may cause us to experience higher churn, losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. 
 Additionally, climate change concerns and the potential resulting environmental impact may result in new or more stringent environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations that may affect us, our suppliers, and our customers. Such laws or regulations could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers, or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.

(1) In June 2024, our board of directors authorized a common stock repurchase program of up to 4.0 million. See Note 8. Stockholders Equity for further information. The Company withholds shares of common stock on behalf of certain employees in connection with the vesting of restricted stock unit awards issued to such employees to satisfy the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. Although these withheld shares are not issued or considered common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program and therefore are not included in the preceding table, they are treated as common stock repurchases in our financial statements as they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. 
 (2) Average price per share excludes excise taxes and broker s commissions. 
 (3) Amounts presented excludes excise taxes and broker s commissions on share repurchases.
