HG HOLDINGS, INC. 
 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (unaudited) 

The substantial majority of the Company's title insurance business is dependent upon the overall level of residential and commercial real estate activity and mortgage markets, which are cyclical and seasonal. Residential purchase activity is typically slower in the winter months with increased volumes in the spring and summer months and is sensitive to interest rates. Refinance activity is not seasonal, but is generally correlated with changes in interest rates and general economic cycles. Commercial real estate volumes are less sensitive to changes in interest rates than residential real estate volumes, but fluctuate based on local supply and demand conditions and financing availability. Commercial real estate historically has elevated activity towards the end of the year. However, changes in general economic conditions in the United States and abroad can cause fluctuations in these traditional patterns of real estate activity, and changes in the general economic conditions in a geography can cause fluctuations in these traditional patterns of real estate activity in that geography. The Company s revenues from title insurance premiums in future periods are likely to fluctuate due to these and other factors which are beyond management s control. 
 
 In conducting its title insurance operations, the Company often holds customers assets in escrow, pending completion of real estate transactions. This cash is presented as restricted cash on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company records an offsetting escrow liability given that we are liable for the disposition of these escrowed funds. 
 
 Real Estate 
 
 The Company engages in rental real estate through its equity investment in HC Realty. HC Realty is an internally-managed real estate investment trust REIT focused on acquiring, financing, owning and managing build-to-suit or renovate-to-suit, single-tenant properties leased primarily to the U.S. government and administered by the U.S. General Services Administration or directly by the federal government agencies or sub-agencies occupying such properties (referred to as Government Properties ). HC Realty invests primarily in Government Properties ranging from to rentable square feet that are in their initial lease term after original construction or renovation-to-suit. HC Realty further emphasizes Government Properties that perform law enforcement, public service or other functions that support the mission of the agencies or sub-agencies occupying such properties. Leases associated with the Government Properties in which HC Realty invests are full faith and credit obligations of the United States of America. HC Realty intends to grow its portfolio primarily through direct acquisitions of Government Properties; although, HC Realty may elect to invest in Government Properties through indirect investments, such as joint ventures. 
 
 The Company currently owns shares of HC Realty s Common Stock (the HC Common Stock and shares of HC Realty s Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (the HC Series B Stock ). As of September 30, 2024 , the Company owns approximately of the voting interest of HC Realty. In June 2024, HC Realty effected a one 1 for one thousand two hundred ) reverse stock split of its common stock, which resulted in a reduction in the number of our shares of HC Common Stock from to . 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , HC Realty owned Government Properties, comprised of Government Properties that it owns and Government Property that it owns subject to a ground lease, each of which is leased to the United States government and occupied by tenant agencies and sub-agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Immigration Customs Enforcement, the Social Security Administration and the Department of Transportation. HC Realty s portfolio properties contain approximately leased rentable square feet located in states. As of September 30, 2024 , its portfolio properties are leased to the United States government and occupied by different federal government agencies. Based on leased rentable square feet, the portfolio has a weighted average remaining lease term of years if none of the tenants early termination rights are exercised and years if all of the tenants early termination rights are exercised. 
 
 Reinsurance 
 
 The Company, through the formation of White Rock USA Cell 47, previously engaged in providing another insurance company excess-of-loss reinsurance coverage related to catastrophic weather risk in Texas. The Company did not have any reinsurance contracts in-force during the nine -month periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023; however, the Company may actively look to provide reinsurance coverage to other carriers as future opportunities arise.

Fair value measurement 
 
 Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The hierarchy for inputs used in determining fair value maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available. Assets and liabilities recorded on our Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value are categorized in the fair value hierarchy based on the observability of inputs to the valuation techniques as follows: 
 
 Level 1: Assets and liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that we can access. 
 
 Level 2: Assets and liabilities whose values are based on the following: 
 
 a. Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; 
 b. Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or 
 c. Valuation models whose inputs are observable, directly, or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
 
 Level 3: Assets and liabilities whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. Unobservable inputs reflect our estimates of the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the assets and liabilities. 
 
 Where available, we estimate the fair value of our investments using the closing prices on the last business day of the reporting period, obtained from active markets such as the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and NYSE American. For securities for which quoted prices in active markets are unavailable, we use a third -party pricing service that utilizes quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments, benchmark interest rates, broker quotes and other relevant inputs to estimate the fair value of those securities for which quoted prices are unavailable. 
 
 Our fixed-income securities are classified as held-to-maturity and are reported at amortized cost as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . The Company performs ongoing impairment evaluations, and we did not record any current expected credit losses during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , as U.S. government and agency securities are assumed to have no risk of non-payment. 
 
 The disclosed fair value of our fixed-income securities is initially calculated by a third -party pricing service. Valuation service providers typically obtain data about market transactions and other key valuation model inputs from multiple sources and, through the use of proprietary models, produce valuation information in the form of a single fair value for individual fixed-income and other securities for which a fair value has been requested. The inputs used by the valuation service providers include, but are not limited to, market prices from recently completed transactions and transactions of comparable securities, interest rate yield curves, credit spreads, liquidity spreads, currency rates and other information, as applicable. Credit and liquidity spreads are typically implied from completed transactions and transactions of comparable securities. Valuation service providers also use proprietary discounted cash flow models that are widely accepted in the financial services industry and similar to those used by other market participants to value the same financial information. The valuation models take into account, among other things, market observable information as of the measurement date, as described above, as well as the specific attributes of the security being valued, including its term, interest rate, credit rating, industry sector and, where applicable, collateral quality and other issue or issuer specific information. Executing valuation models effectively requires seasoned professional judgment and experience. 

The following tables present fair value, by valuation hierarchy, and carrying value of the financial instruments not measured at fair value for which fair value is disclosed as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands): 

1 The carrying value measurements in the tables above do not equal Investments on our Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets as they exclude the Company's investment in limited partnership carried at NAV (as defined below) as a practical expedient. 

The Company has elected the practical expedient for fair value for its investment in limited partnership which is estimated based on our share of the net asset value NAV of the limited partnership, as provided by the independent fund administrator. The Company s share of the NAV represents the Company s proportionate interest in the members equity of the limited partnership. 
 
 The Company s investments in related parties are accounted for either under the equity method of accounting or, where they do not meet the criteria of accounting under the equity method, under the cost adjusted for market observable events less impairment method. For information about the Company s investments in related parties, refer to Note 3, Investments in Related Parties.

Each company paid its share of the reinsurance cost based on separate company earned premiums. The agreement expired December 31, 2023. 
 
 NCTIC s reinsured risks are treated, to the extent of reinsurance, as though they are risks for which the Company is not liable. However, NCTIC remains contingently liable in the event its reinsurers do not meet their obligations under these reinsurance contracts. NCTIC uses a broker to place its reinsurance through Lloyd s syndicates, a group of underwriters who work together to provide insurance coverage for a variety of risks. Chaucer Syndicates Ltd. Chaucer Syndicates and Beazley Syndicate Beazley are each participants in the Lloyd s syndicate. As such, NCTIC has a concentration of reinsurance risk with these third -party reinsurers that could have a material impact on NCTIC s financial position in the event that either of these reinsurers fail to perform their obligations under the reinsurance treaty. As of September 30, 2024 , Chaucer Syndicates was rated A (excellent) by A.M. Best, A+ (strong) by S P and AA- (very strong) by Fitch. Beazley was rated A+ (superior) by A.M. Best, AA- (very strong) by S P and AA- (very strong) by Fitch. The Company monitors the financial condition of individual reinsurers, risk concentration arising from similar activities as well as economic characteristics of reinsurers to attempt to reduce the risk of default by such reinsurers. Given the quality of the reinsurers, management believes this possibility to be remote. At September 30, 2024 , there were reinsurance recoverables on paid claims or unpaid reserves. 
 
 The effects of reinsurance on the title premiums written and earned at NCTIC for the three - and nine -month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows (in thousands):

million, decreasing its valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to million as of September 30, 2024 . The primary assets covered by this valuation allowance are net operating losses, which approximate million at September 30, 2024 . The Company did not make any cash payments for income tax in the three - and nine -month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 due to its net operating loss carryforwards. 
 
 The Company maintains a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that currently exceeds our deferred tax liabilities. The primary assets covered by this valuation allowance are net operating loss carry-forwards. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740, Income Taxes , which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance. The Company s results over the most recent four -year period were heavily affected by business restructuring activities. The Company s cumulative loss represented sufficient negative evidence to require a valuation allowance. The Company intends to maintain a valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal, resulting in no deferred tax asset balance being recognized. Should the Company determine that it will not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will be charged to income in the period such determination is made. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , the Company has deferred tax assets not covered by a valuation allowance. The Company s effective tax rates are impacted by the 2022 return to provision adjustment for Florida for tax year 2022.

 Overview 
 
 For a description of our business, including descriptions of segments and recent business developments, see the discussion in Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Nature of Operations Description of the Business in the accompanying Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which is incorporated by reference into this Part I, Item 2. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our sources of income include earnings from our title insurance subsidiaries, management service fees earned and dividends on HC Realty s Common Stock (the HC Common Stock and HC Realty s 10.00 Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (the HC Series B Stock ).

 The Company will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities which will allow us to potentially derive benefit from the Company s net operating loss carryforwards and also create appropriate risk adjusted returns for stockholders. 
 
 Title Insurance Segment Trends and Conditions 
 
 Our title insurance segment revenue is closely related to the level of real estate activity, such as sales, mortgage financing and mortgage refinancing. Declines in the level of real estate activity or the average price of real estate sales will adversely affect our title insurance revenues. The industry as a whole saw a decline in total real estate transactions in the last two years, largely due to higher mortgage interest rates. Mortgage rates remained very high after emergency actions taken by the Federal Reserve to substantially increase its benchmark interest rate in an attempt to control inflation. During its September 2024 meeting, the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75 to 5.00 as of September 30, 2024. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Federal Reserve further lowered the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to a current range of 4.50 to 4.75 . While the latest and potential future Federal Reserve rate decreases may positively impact the title insurance market, mortgage rates continue to remain relatively high and will likely continue to contribute to decreased real estate activity. Per the Mortgage Bankers Association's MBA Mortgage Finance Forecast as of October 2024, interest rates on a Freddie Mac 30-year, fixed rate mortgage averaged 7.0 in the second quarter of 2024 but are projected to decrease to 6.3 by the fourth quarter of 2024 and 5.9 in 2025 through 2026.

Further, per the MBA Forecast Commentary update as of August 2024, the total number of loan originations is forecasted to increase by approximately 5.0 in 2024 as compared to 2023, from approximately 4.2 million units (the lowest level since 1997) to approximately 4.4 million units. Mortgage origination volume is expected to increase by approximately 20 in 2024 as compared to 2023, to approximately 1.8 trillion in mortgage originations, and by approximately 18 in 2025 as compared to 2024 projected volumes, driven by projected increases in purchase volume and refinances. 
 
 A shortage in the supply of homes for sale, increasing home prices, high mortgage interest rates, inflation and disrupted labor markets have created volatility in the residential real estate market since 2021. Despite the Federal Reserve lowering the federal funds rate by 50 basis points in September 2024, and additional 25 basis points in November 2024, current interest rates remain at elevated levels compared to pre-2021 interest rates. Additionally, recent geopolitical uncertainties have created elevated volatility in the global economy. 
 
 Because commercial real estate transactions tend to be generally driven by supply and demand for commercial space and occupancy rates in a particular area rather than by interest rate fluctuations, we believe that our commercial real estate title insurance business is less dependent on the industry cycles discussed above than our residential real estate title business. Commercial real estate transaction volume is also often linked to the availability of financing. Factors including U.S. tax reform and a shift in U.S. monetary policy have had, and are expected to continue to have, varying effects on availability of financing in the U.S. Lower corporate and individual tax rates, and corporate tax-deductibility of capital expenditures have provided increased capacity and incentive for investments in commercial real estate. 
 
 Historically, real estate transactions have produced seasonal revenue fluctuations in the real estate industry. The first calendar quarter is typically the weakest quarter in terms of revenue due to the generally low volume of home sales during January and February. The second and third calendar quarters are typically the strongest quarters in terms of revenue, primarily due to a higher volume of residential transactions in the spring and summer months. The fourth quarter is typically strong due to the desire of commercial entities to complete transactions by year-end. Seasonality in recent years deviated from historical patterns due to COVID-19 and the subsequent rapid increase in interest rates. We have noted short-term fluctuations through recent years in resale and refinance transactions as a result of changes in interest rates.

Comparison of three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 The Company s net title premiums written were relatively flat at 1.6 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.5 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, and 4.7 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 During the second quarter of 2023, the Company earned the last portion of reinsurance premium related to a catastrophic weather risk contract which expired December 31, 2022. There were no written reinsurance contracts in-force during the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Table of Contents 

Escrow and other title fees revenue also remained relatively flat at 0.7 million for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and 1.9 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.1 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, as a result of normal period over period fluctuations. 
 
 Management fees were relatively flat at 0.8 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.7 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. The Company's management fees were 2.3 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.5 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of the timing of the management advisory services contract that was entered into on April 1, 2023. 
 
 Total revenue for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 increased 0.1 million as compared to the same period of 2023 as a result of higher net title premium written, partially offset by lower escrow and other title fees. Total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 0.3 million as compared to the same period of 2023 as a result of higher management fees earned, partially offset by lower reinsurance written premium and lower escrow and other title fees. 
 
 The Company s cost of revenues consists primarily of a provision for title claim losses and underwriting expenses, which are largely comprised of commissions to title agencies. Cost of revenues for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 0.1 million. Cost of revenues for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 0.3 million, compared to 0.5 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. This decrease is a result of lower volume of unaffiliated title business and lower provision for title claims for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period last year. 
 
 The Company s operating expenses primarily consist of general and administrative expenses such as personnel expenses, office and technology expenses, and professional fees. Operating expenses for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 were 3.3 million, compared to 3.1 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. This increase is mainly a result of expenses related to the Company's efforts around expansion of its title insurance business into other states. Operating expenses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 were 9.5 million, compared to 9.8 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. This reduction in operating expenses is a result of lower legal costs and the Company's workforce optimization efforts during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period last year. 
 
 Other income and expense primarily consists of net interest income, dividend income, change in the net asset value of investment in limited partnership as well as changes in value of our related party investment in HC Common Stock. Other income and expense was 0.4 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.5 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily a result of no dividend declared on the HC Series B Stock during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.3 million of dividends declared on the HC Series B Stock for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. This reduction in the net investment income component of other income and expense was partially offset by higher earnings related to the Company's investment in limited partnership in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023. Other income and expense for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 0.9 million, compared to 1.2 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is predominantly a result of no dividend declared on the HC Series B Stock during the second and third quarters of 2024. 
 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Sources of liquidity include cash on hand, earnings from our title insurance subsidiaries, and dividends from our HC Series B Stock. At September 30, 2024, we had 10.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and an additional 12.6 million in restricted cash, substantially all of which is cash held in escrow for title insurance transactions. A portion of our unrestricted and restricted cash is currently held in savings accounts earning interest at approximately 4.7 annually. Historically, we also received discretionary dividends on our HC Common Stock and HC Series B Stock at annual dividend rates of approximately 0.4 and 10 , respectively. No dividends were declared on HC Common Stock and HC Series B Stock for the second or third quarters of 2024. We believe that the sources stated above will be sufficient to satisfy our operating requirements for the foreseeable future, and we do not anticipate a need to raise funds from sources other than those described above within the next 12 months.

Cash flows from operating activities differ from net income due to adjustments for non-cash items, such as gains and losses on investments, the timing of disbursements for taxes, claims and other accrued liabilities, and collections or changes in receivables and other assets. Net cash provided by operating activities of 5.0 million differs from operating results for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to an increase of 5.0 million in escrow liabilities on the title insurance subsidiaries. Net cash provided by operating activities of 5.6 million differs from operating results for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase of 5.9 million in escrow liabilities on the title insurance subsidiaries. 
 
 Cash flows from investing activities include effects of purchases and sales of plant, property, and equipment, and purchases and sales of invested assets. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company purchased 0.7 million and disposed of 0.2 million of investments in limited partnerships, as well as redeemed 1.1 million of fixed income securities.

 Cash flows from financing activities include effects of capital contributions, dividends to stockholders, repurchases of outstanding shares of common stock, and changes in noncontrolling interest. Cash flows used in financing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 of 0.4 million consisted primarily of 0.2 million of repurchases of common stock and 0.1 million of distributions to non-controlling shareholders. Cash flows used in financing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 of 41,000 was predominantly a result of 50,000 of repurchases of common stock.

 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to us, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and we necessarily were required to apply our judgment in evaluating whether the benefits of the controls and procedures that we adopt outweigh their costs. 
 
 As required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, an evaluation as of September 30, 2024 was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of September 30, 2024, were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 
 Changes in internal controls over financial reporting. 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
