Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations. 

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL 

 CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION 

Management's discussion and analysis is intended
to be read in conjunction with the Company's unaudited financial statements and the integral notes thereto for the quarter ended September
30, 2024. The following statements may be forward looking in nature and actual results may differ materially. 

A. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

REVENUES: Total revenues from sales decreased to 293,936
for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 342,721 in the third quarter of 2023, reflecting a decrease of 14.2 . Management believes
the decrease in sales revenues is due to the decrease in customer demand. Year to date total revenues from sales decreased to 983,566
in 2024 as compared to 1,233,016 in 2023, reflecting a decrease of 20.2 . Management believes the decrease in sales revenues is due to
a decrease in customer demand and the increased cost associated with funding capital improvements. 

The Company's revenues have historically fluctuated
from quarter to quarter due to timing factors such as product shipments to customers, customer order placement, customer buying trends,
and changes in the general economic environment. The procurement process regarding plant and project automation, or project development,
which usually surrounds the decision to purchase ESTeem products, can be lengthy. This procurement process may involve bid activities
unrelated to the ESTeem products, such as additional systems and subcontract work, as well as capital budget considerations on the part
of the customer. Because of the complexity of this procurement process, forecasts with regard to the Company's revenues are difficult
to predict. 

A percentage breakdown of the Company s market
segments of Domestic and Foreign Export sales for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows: 

Three Months ended September 30, 2024 
 Three Months ended September 30, 2023

BACKLOG: 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a sales
order backlog of 5,109. The Company s customers generally place orders on an "as needed basis". Shipment for most of
the Company s products is generally made within 1 to 5 working days after receipt of customer orders, with the exception of ongoing,
scheduled projects, and custom designed equipment. 

COST OF SALES: 

Cost
of sales percentages for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023 were 49.5 and 52.1 of respective net sales. Cost of sales percentages
for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 47.0 and 47.6 , respectively. The cost of sales percentage decrease
for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 is the result of the product mix sold during the same period of 2023. The product
mix varies from period to period based on customer needs.

General and administrative: For the third quarter
of 2024, general and administrative expenses increased 4,052 to 59,881, due to increased professional services when compared with the
same quarter of 2023. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses increased by 9,242, to
 211,328, due to increased payroll and increased professional services. 

Research and development: Research and development
expenses increased 2,122 to 28,236 during the third quarter of 2024 due to increased payroll when compared with the same quarter of
2023. For the nine-month period, research and development expenses increased by 9,465 to 92,263, due to increased payroll and prototype
services purchased. 

Marketing and sales: During the third quarter
of 2024, marketing and sales expenses increased 90 to 133,313 when compared with the same period of 2023, due to increased travel expenses,
which were partially offset by lower payroll and benefit expenses. For the nine-month period, marketing and sales expenses increased by
 3,623 to 458,442, due to increased travel and marketing expenses which were partially offset by lower payroll and benefit expenses. 

OTHER INCOME: 

The Company earned 5,482 in interest income during
the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and 16,545 for the nine-month period. Sources of this income were money market accounts and certificates
of deposit. 

NET LOSS: 

The Company had a net loss of 67,441 for the third
quarter of 2024 compared to net loss of 42,505 for the same quarter of 2023. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the
Company recorded a net loss of 223,875 compared with a net loss of 75,759 for the same period of 2023. The increase in net loss during
2024 is the result of increased operating expenses and lower sales.

B. FINANCIAL
CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

The Corporation's current asset to current liabilities
ratio at September 30, 2024 was 30.2 compared to 16.2 at December 31, 2023. The increase in the current ratio is due to the decrease of
accounts payable, short-term lease payable and increase in inventory at September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023. 

At September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash
equivalents including certificates of deposit of 558,223 as compared to cash and cash equivalent of 886,252 at December 31, 2023. 

Cash used from operating activities increased by 165,170
for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is attributable to an increase
in net loss for the period being 148,116 more than the same period in 2023. The decrease in the change in accounts receivable, accounts
payable, and inventory balances accounted for a 164,903 of the cash used versus the same period in 2023. 

In
management's opinion, the Company's cash and cash equivalents and other working capital at September 30, 2024 is sufficient to satisfy
requirements for operations, capital expenditures, and other expenditures as may arise during 2024 and into the first nine months of
2025. 

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS: The above discussion
may contain forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. In addition to the factors discussed above, among
other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following: competitive factors such as rival wireless architectures
and price pressures; availability of third party component products at reasonable prices; inventory risks due to shifts in market demand
and/or price erosion of purchased components; change in product mix, and risk factors that are listed in the Company's reports and registration
statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

The Company has no significant off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to its stockholders. 

Item 1. Controls and Procedures 

An evaluation has been performed under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and the
operation of our "disclosure controls and procedures" (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934) as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded
that the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 

The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions
about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under
all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. However, management believes that our system of disclosure controls and procedures
are designed to provide a reasonable level of assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There have not been any changes in our internal control
over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal
quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
