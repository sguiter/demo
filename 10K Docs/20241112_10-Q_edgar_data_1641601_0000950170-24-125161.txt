FORWARD-LOOKIN G STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, future events and financial performance, which involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Certain statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"). Forward-looking statements are not historical facts and include any statement that, without limitation, may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements instead of historical or current facts and may contain words like anticipates, approximately, believes, budget, can, could, continues, contemplates, estimates, expects, forecast, intends, may, might, objective, outlook, predicts, probably, plans, potential, project, seeks, shall, should, target, will, or the negative of these terms and other words, phrases, or expressions with similar meaning. 
 Any forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are based upon our historical performance and on our current plans, estimates and expectations in light of information currently available to us. The inclusion of forward-looking information should not be regarded as a representation by us that the future plans, estimates or expectations will be achieved. Such forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties and assumptions relating to our operations, financial results, financial condition, business, prospects, growth strategy and liquidity. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements, and the Company cannot give assurances that such statements will prove to be correct. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information or otherwise. Given these uncertainties, the reader should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or estimated by us include those that are discussed herein as well as in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, as well as other unknown risks and uncertainties. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to: 
 Acquisition related factors: 
 The businesses of any bank acquired by us may not be integrated successfully or the integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected; 

The expected growth opportunities or costs savings from such transactions may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; 

Revenues following such transactions may be lower than expected as a result of losses of customers or other reasons; 

Deposit attrition, operating costs, customer loss and business disruption following such transactions, including difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees, may be greater than expected; 

Governmental approvals of such transactions may not be obtained on the proposed terms or expected timeframe; 

Reputational risks and the reaction of the companies customers may be adverse to such transactions; 

Diversion of management time on merger related issues may have negative effcts on day-to-day operations. 

Factors affecting our Bank generally: 
 Changes in asset quality and credit risk of our Bank; 

Inflation; 

Customer acceptance of our products and services; 

Customer borrowing, repayment, investment and deposit practices; 

The negative impact on profitability imposed on us by a compressed net interest margin on loans and other extensions of credit that affects our ability to lend profitably and to price loans effectively in the face of competitive pressures; 

Our liquidity requirements could be adversely affected by changes in our assets and liabilities; 

Our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified banking professionals; 

Failure to attract or retain stable deposits at reasonable cost that is competitive with the larger international, national, and regional financial service providers with which we compete; 

Significant reliance on loans secured by real estate and the associated vulnerability to downturns in the local real estate market, natural disasters and other variables impacting the value of real estate; 

3 

The introduction, withdrawal, success and timing of business initiatives; 

The impact, extent, and timing of technological changes; 

A weakening of the economies in which we conduct operations may adversely affect our operating results; 

The U.S. legal and regulatory framework, changes in such framework, or official or informal mandates directed by state and federal regulators in reports of examination or other mandates could adversely affect our operating results; 

The interest rate environment may compress margins and adversely affect net interest income and negatively affect the market value of state, county and municipal securities held for investment; 

Competition from other financial services companies in our markets could adversely affect operations; and 

Interruption in our business and the businesses of our customers caused by a downturn in the economy and possible weather-related conditions such as tornadoes or hurricanes or further outbreaks of COVID. 

You should also consider carefully the risk factors referred to in Item 1A of Part II of this Form 10-Q, which address additional factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements and could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. The risks discussed in this report are factors that, individually or in the aggregate, management believes could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider such disclosures to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. Factors not here or there listed may develop or, if currently extant, we may not have yet recognized them. 
 The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and, except to the extent required by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

The unrecognized losses on held-to-maturity investment securities presented in the table above do not include unrecognized losses on securities that were transferred from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity totaling million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023. These unrecognized losses that were transferred in 2022 are included as a separate component of stockholders' equity and are being amortized over the remaining term of the securities. The Company has a zero loss expectation for its HTM securities portfolio, except for U.S. State and Municipal securities, and therefore it is not required to estimate an allowance for credit losses related to these securities. For HTM securities that do not have a zero loss expectation, the allowance for credit losses is based on the security s amortized cost, excluding interest receivable, and represents the portion of the amortized cost that the Company does not expect to collect over the life of the security. The allowance for credit losses is determined using average industry credit ratings and historical loss experience, and is initially recognized upon acquisition of the securities, and subsequently remeasured on a recurring basis. The Company evaluates available for sale (AFS) debt securities that experienced a decline in fair value below amortized cost for credit impairment. In performing an assessment of whether any decline in fair value is due to a credit loss, the Company considers the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost, changes in credit ratings, any adverse economic conditions, as well as all relevant information at the individual security level, such as credit deterioration of the issuer, explicit or implicit guarantees by the federal government or collateral underlying the security. If it is determined that the decline in fair value was due to credit losses, an allowance for credit losses is recorded, limited to the amount the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. The non-credit related decrease in the fair value, such as a decline due to changes in market interest rates, is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. The Company recognizes a credit impairment if the Company has the intent to sell the security, or it is more likely than not that the Bank will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost.

The Company owned a total of securities with unrealized losses of million at September 30, 2024 . The unrealized losses were primarily attributable to changes in interest rates, rather than deterioration in credit quality. The individual securities are each investment grade securities. The Company considers factors such as the financial condition of the issuer including credit ratings and specific events affecting the operations of the issuer, volatility of the security, underlying assets that collateralize the debt security, and other industry and macroeconomic conditions. The Company does not intend to sell these securities, and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell these securities before recovery of the amortized cost. The issuers of these securities continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of the securities. As such, there is allowance for credit losses on available for sale or held to maturity securities recognized as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Accrued interest receivable is not included in available-for-sale security balances and is presented in accrued interest receivable on the consolidated statement of financial condition. Interest receivable on securities was approximately million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and was excluded from the estimate of credit losses. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, securities with a carrying value of approximately million and million, respectively, were pledged to secure public deposits as required by law.

The Bank grants loans and extensions of credit to individuals and a variety of businesses and corporations located in its general trade area. Although the Bank has a diversified loan portfolio, a substantial portion of the loan portfolio is collateralized by improved and unimproved real estate and is dependent upon the real estate market. Relevant risk characteristics for these portfolio segments generally include debt service coverage, loan-to-value ratios and financial performance on non-consumer loans and credit scores, debt-to-income, collateral type and loan-to-value ratios for consumer loans. The loan portfolio has been disaggregated into segments and then further disaggregated into classes for certain disclosures. A portfolio segment is defined as the level at which an entity develops and documents a systematic method for determining its allowance for credit losses. There are primary loan portfolio segments that include real estate, commercial, and consumer. A class is generally determined based on the initial measurement attribute, risk characteristic of the loan, and the Company s method for monitoring and assessing credit risk. Classes within the real estate portfolio segment include residential real estate, commercial real estate, construction and land development and home equity lines of credit. The portfolio segments of non-real estate commercial loans and consumer loans have not been further segregated by class. Under the current expected credit losses (CECL) methodology, the allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics. For loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with the collectively evaluated pools, evaluations are performed on an individual basis. For all loan segments collectively evaluated, losses are predicted over a period of time determined to be reasonable and supportable, and at the end of the reasonable and supportable forecast period losses are reverted to long-term historical averages. The estimated loan losses for all loan segments are adjusted for changes in qualitative factors not inherently considered in the quantitative analyses.

The Company's unfunded lending commitments are unconditionally cancellable and therefore allowance for credit losses has been recorded. In the event that collection of principal becomes uncertain, the Company has policies in place to reverse accrued interest in a timely manner. Therefore, the Company has made a policy election to exclude accrued interest from the measurement of the allowance for credit losses. Accrued interest on loans of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, was included in accrued interest receivable and was excluded from the estimate of credit losses.

Collateral dependent loans are loans for which the repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The Company reviews individually evaluated loans for designation as collateral dependent loans, as well as other loans that management of the Company designates as having higher risk. These loans do not share common risk characteristics and are not included within the collectively evaluated loans for determining the allowance for credit losses. The Company considers all individually evaluated loans to be collateral dependent.

The Company has estimated the fair values of these assets using Level 3 inputs, specifically the appraised value of the collateral. Individually evaluated loan balances represent those collateral dependent loans where management has estimated the credit loss by comparing the loan s carrying value against the expected realizable fair value of the collateral dependent loan for the amount of the credit loss. For Level 3 assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 for the valuation technique, we used appraisals. For the significant unobservable input, we used appraisal discounts, and weighted average input of - was used for the period ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

The estimated fair values of the standby letters of credit and loan commitments on which the committed interest rate is less than the current market rate are insignificant as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company assumes interest rate risk (the risk that general interest rate levels will change) as a result of its normal operations. As a result, the fair values of the Company s financial instruments will change when interest rate levels change and that change may be either favorable or unfavorable to the Company. Management attempts to match maturities of assets and liabilities to the extent believed necessary to minimize interest rate risk. However, borrowers with fixed-rate obligations are less likely to prepay in a rising rate environment and more likely to prepay in a falling rate environment. Conversely, depositors who are receiving fixed-rates are more likely to withdraw funds before maturity in a rising rate environment and less likely to do so in a falling-rate environment. Management monitors rates and maturities of assets and liabilities, and attempts to minimize interest rate risk by adjusting terms of new loans and deposits and by investing in securities with terms that mitigate the Company s overall interest rate risk.

Contributions to the plan by the Company were approximately thousand and thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Outstanding shares of the Company s common stock allocated to participants at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 totaled shares and shares, respectively, and there were unallocated shares. These shares are treated as outstanding for purposes of calculating earnings per share and dividends on these shares are included in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity. The Company s ESOP includes a put option for shares of the Company s common stock distributed from the ESOP. Shares are distributed from the ESOP primarily to separate vested participants and certain eligible participants who elect to diversify their account balances. Since the Company s common stock is not currently traded on an established securities market, if the owners of distributed shares desire to sell their shares, the Company is required to purchase the shares at fair value during put option periods following the distribution of the shares from the ESOP. The first put option period is within sixty days following the distribution of the shares from the ESOP. The second put option period begins on the first day of the fifth month of the plan year for a sixty day period. The fair value of distributed shares subject to the put option totaled as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The cost of the ESOP shares totaled million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Due to the Company s obligation under the put option, the distributed shares and ESOP shares are classified as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated statements of financial condition and totaled million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023, which are contained in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K under Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements. 
 The following discussion pertains to our historical results on a consolidated basis. However, because we conduct all of our material business operations through our subsidiaries, the discussion and analysis relates to activities primarily conducted at the subsidiary level. 
 All dollar amounts in the tables in this section are in thousands of dollars, except per share data, yields, percentages and rates or when specifically identified. As used in this Item, the words we, us, our, the Company, RFC, River and similar terms refer to River Financial Corporation and its consolidated affiliate, unless the context indicates otherwise. 
 
 Our Business 
 We are a bank holding company headquartered in Prattville, Alabama. We engage in the business of banking through our wholly-owned banking subsidiary, River Bank Trust, which we may refer to as the Bank or River Bank. Through the Bank, we provide a broad array of financial services to businesses, business owners, professionals, and consumers. As of September 30, 2024, we operated twenty-three full-service banking offices in Alabama in the cities of Montgomery, Prattville, Millbrook, Wetumpka, Auburn, Opelika, Gadsden, Alexander City, Daphne, Clanton, Dothan, Enterprise, Mobile, Decatur, Huntsville, Saraland, and Birmingham, Alabama. We also have one loan production office in Florence, Alabama. 
 Segments 
 While our chief decision makers monitor the revenue streams of the various banking products and services, operations are managed and financial performance is evaluated on a Company-wide basis. Accordingly, all of the Company s banking operations are considered by management to be aggregated in one reportable operating segment. Because the overall banking operations comprise substantially all of the consolidated operations, no separate segment disclosures are presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Certain of these policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or subject to variation and may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the current period or future periods. The use of estimates, assumptions, and judgment is necessary when financial assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at or adjusted to reflect fair value. Assets carried at fair value inherently result in more financial statement volatility. Fair values and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on quoted market prices or are provided by other independent third-party sources, when available. When such information is not available, management estimates valuation adjustments. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. 
 The following briefly describes the more complex policies involving a significant amount of judgments about valuation and the application of complex accounting standards and interpretations. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The allowance for credit losses has been determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company is responsible for the timely and periodic determination of the amount of the allowance for credit losses. Management believes that the allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover expected credit losses over the life of the loan portfolio. Although management evaluates available information to determine the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, the level of allowance is an estimate which is subject to significant judgment and short-term change. Because of uncertainties associated with local and national economic forecasts, the operating and regulatory environment, collateral values and future cash flows from the loan portfolio, it is possible that a material change could occur in the allowance for credit losses in the near term. The evaluation of the adequacy of loan collateral is often based upon estimates and appraisals. Because of changing economic conditions, the valuations determined from such estimates and appraisals may also change. 
 Accordingly, the Company may ultimately incur losses that vary from management s current estimates. Adjustments to the allowance for credit losses will be reported in the period in which such adjustments become known and can be reasonably estimated. All loan losses are charged to the allowance for credit losses when the loss actually occurs or when the collectability of the principal is unlikely. Recoveries are credited to the allowance at the time of recovery. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Company s allowance for credit losses. As a result of such examinations, the Company may need to recognize additions to the allowance for credit losses based on the regulators judgments. 
 In estimating the allowance for credit losses, the Company relies on models and economic forecasts developed by external parties as the primary driver of the allowance for credit losses. These models and forecasts are based on nationwide sets of data. Economic forecasts can change significantly over an economic cycle and have a significant level of uncertainty associated with them. The performance of the models is dependent on the variables used in the models being reasonable proxies for the loan portfolio s performance. However, these variables may not capture all sources of risk within the portfolio. As a result, the Company reviews the results and makes qualitative adjustments to the models to capture limitations of the models as necessary. Such qualitative factors may include adjustments to better capture the imprecision associated with the economic forecasts, and the ability of the models to capture emerging risks within the portfolio that may not be represented in the data. These judgments are evaluated through the Company s review process and revised on a quarterly basis to account for changes in facts and circumstances. It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one of the quantitative inputs or qualitative factors might affect the overall allowance for credit losses, and the Company s current assessments may not reflect the potential future impact of changes to those inputs or factors.

Investment Securities Impairment 
 Effective January 1, 2023, the Company estimates and recognizes an allowance for credit losses for held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities pursuant to ASU No. 2016-13. The Company has a zero loss expectation for its HTM securities portfolio, except for U.S. State and Municipal securities, and therefore it is not required to estimate an allowance for credit losses related to these securities. For HTM securities that do not have a zero loss expectation, the allowance for credit losses is based on the security s amortized cost, excluding interest receivable, and represents the portion of the amortized cost that the Company does not expect to collect over the life of the security. The allowance for credit losses is determined using average industry credit ratings and historical loss experience, and is initially recognized upon acquisition of the securities, and subsequently remeasured on a recurring basis. The Company evaluates available for sale (AFS) debt securities that experienced a decline in fair value below amortized cost for credit impairment. In performing an assessment of whether any decline in fair value is due to a credit loss, the Company considers the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost, changes in credit ratings, any adverse economic conditions, as well as all relevant information at the individual security level, such as credit deterioration of the issuer, explicit or implicit guarantees by the federal government or collateral underlying the security. If it is determined that the decline in fair value was due to credit losses, an allowance for credit losses is recorded, limited to the amount the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. The non-credit related decrease in the fair value, such as a decline due to changes in market interest rates, is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. The Company recognizes a credit impairment if the Company has the intent to sell the security, or it is more likely than not that the Bank will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost. Prior to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 Management evaluated AFS and HTM debt securities for other-than-temporary-impairment on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. 
 
 Comparison of the Results of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 The following is a narrative discussion and analysis of significant changes in our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net Income 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, our net income was 8.7 million, compared to 5.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 2.8 million, or 47.11 . The primary reason for the increase in net income for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023 was an increase in net interest income coupled with an increase in noninterest income. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income was 24.0 million compared to 20.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 4.0 million, or 19.62 . This increase is a result of higher yields on new and repricing loans. Total noninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 was 4.5 million compared to 3.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. This increase in noninterest income was primarily the result of loan related fee income. Total noninterest expense in the third quarter of 2024 increased 643.0 thousand, or 4.27 , from the third quarter of 2023. The most significant noninterest expense continues to be salaries and employee benefits which increased approximately 498.0 thousand. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net income was 22.1 million, compared to 18.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 3.5 million, or 18.70 . The primary reason for the increase in net income for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023 was an increase in net interest income offset by a decrease in noninterest income. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income was 68.1 million compared to 58.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 10.0 million, or 17.24 . This increase is a result of higher yields on new and repricing loans. Total noninterest income for the first nine months of 2024 was 11.3 million compared to 15.2 million in the first nine months of 2023. This decrease in noninterest income was primarily the result of a 3.7 million Community Development Financial Institution award recognized in 2023. Noninterest income for the first nine months of 2024 was also reduced by a 1.4 million net loss on sales of investment securities. Total noninterest expense in the third quarter of 2024 increased 1.1 million, or 2.44 , from the third quarter of 2023. The most significant increase was an increase of 1.1 million in salaries and employee benefits.

Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Analysis 
 The largest component of our net income is net interest income the difference between the income earned on interest earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds used to support assets. Net interest income divided by average interest earning assets represents our net interest margin. The major factors that affect net interest income and net interest margin are changes in volumes, the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities. Our net interest margin can also be affected by economic conditions, the competitive environment, loan demand, and deposit flow. Management s ability to respond to changes in these factors by using effective asset-liability management techniques is critical to maintaining the stability of the net interest margin and the primary source of earnings. This is discussed in greater detail under the heading Interest Sensitivity and Market Risk . 
 Comparison of net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 The following table shows, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the average balances of each principal category of our earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the average taxable equivalent yields on assets and average costs of liabilities. These yields and costs are calculated by dividing the income or expense by the average daily balance of the associated assets or liabilities (amounts in thousands).

P rovision for Credit Losses 
 On January 1, 2023, we adopted ASC 326, which introduces the current expected credit losses (CECL) methodology and requires us to estimate all expected credit losses over the remaining life of our loans. Accordingly, the provision for credit losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish an allowance for credit losses that, in management's evaluation, is adequate to provide coverage for all expected credit losses. As a result of evaluating the allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024, management recorded a provision for credit losses of 1.33 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 1.31 million in the third quarter of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, management recorded a provision for credit losses of 4.0 million and 3.9 million, respectively. The minimally increased provision for credit losses allocated was primarily due to continued strength in the performance of our loan portfolio despite some indications of a slowdown in the economy. In management s evaluation, our allowance for credit losses reflects an amount we believe appropriate, based on our allowance assessment methodology, to adequately cover all expected future losses as of the date the allowance is determined. 
 Noninterest Income 
 In addition to net interest income, we generate various types of noninterest income from our operations. Our banking operations generate revenue from service charges and fees mainly on deposit accounts. Our mortgage division generates revenue from originating and selling mortgage loans. Our investment brokerage division generates revenue through a revenue-sharing relationship with a registered broker-dealer. We also own life insurance policies on several key employees and record income on the increase in the cash surrender value of these policies. 
 The following table sets forth the principal components of noninterest income for the periods indicated (amounts in thousands).

The most significant decreases in noninterest income was due to a 3.7 million Community Development Financial Institution award for the same period in 2023 as well as an approximate 1.4 million loss on sales of investment securities in 2024 while the most significant increase was a 487 thousand increase in mortgage operations revenue.

Noninterest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 15.7 million compared with 15.1 million for the same period of 2023. The overall increase was primarily a result of salaries and employee benefits. Salaries and employee benefits increased 498.0 thousand, or 5.51 , to 9.53 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 9.04 million in the third quarter of 2023. The number of full-time equivalent employees decreased from approximately 342 at September 30, 2023 to approximately 340 at September 30, 2024 for an decrease of approximately 0.58 . 
 Noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 46.5 million compared with 45.4 million for the same period of 2023. The overall increase was primarily a result of increases in salaries and employee benefits. Salaries and employee benefits increased 1.1 million, or 4.22 , to 28.2 million in the first nine months of 2024 from 27.1 million in the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 We recognized income tax expense of 2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 24.6 compared to 22.6 for the same period in 2023. The effective tax rate is affected by levels of items of income that are not subject to federal and/or state taxation and by levels of items of expense that are not deductible for federal and/or state income tax purposes. 
 We recognized income tax expense of 6.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 23.8 compared to 22.2 for the same period in 2023. The effective tax rate is affected by levels of items of income that are not subject to federal and/or state taxation and by levels of items of expense that are not deductible for federal and/or state income tax purposes.

Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 
 Overview 
 Our total assets increased 261.2 million, or 8.07 , from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. Loans, net of deferred fees and discounts, increased 183.7 million, or 8.20 , from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. Securities available-for-sale increased by 11.5 million, or 1.85 , and securities held-to-maturity decreased by 3.5 million, or 2.76 , from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents increased 74.6 million, or 102.77 from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. Total deposits increased 308.2 million, or 11.29 , from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 which funded a majority of our loan growth. Total stockholders equity increased 35.0 million, or 17.62 from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. 
 
 Investment Securities 
 We use our securities portfolio primarily to enhance our overall yield on interest-earning assets and as a source of liquidity, as a tool to manage our balance sheet sensitivity and regulatory capital ratios, and as a base upon which to pledge assets for public deposits. When our liquidity position exceeds current needs and our expected loan demand, other investments are considered as a secondary earnings alternative. As investments mature, they are used to meet current cash needs, or they are reinvested to maintain our desired liquidity position. We have designated the majority of our securities as available-for-sale to provide flexibility, in case an immediate need for liquidity arises, and we believe that the composition of the portfolio offers needed flexibility in managing our liquidity position and interest rate sensitivity without adversely impacting our regulatory capital levels. In certain cases, we have designated securities as held-to-maturity to protect capital from changes in the value of the securities portfolio. Securities available-for-sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income (loss), net of related deferred taxes while securities held-to-maturity are reported at amortized cost. Purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in income using the interest method over the terms of the securities. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we purchased investment securities totaling 106.1 million and sold investment securities with proceeds received of 81.7 million including net realized losses of 1.4 million. 
 The following tables summarize the amortized cost, gross unrealized gains, gross unrealized losses, and fair value of debt securities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (amounts in thousands).

Loans 
 Loans are the largest category of interest earning assets and typically provide higher yields than other types of interest earning assets. Associated with the higher loan yields are the inherent credit and liquidity risks which management attempts to control and counterbalance. Total loans averaged 2.39 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2024, or 72.3 of average interest earning assets, as compared to 2.08 billion, or 69.1 of average interest earning assets, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2024, total loans, net of deferred loan fees and discounts, were 2.42 billion, compared to 2.24 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of 183.7 million, or 8.20 . 
 The organic, or non-acquired, growth in our loan portfolio is attributable both to our ability to attract new customers and to our ability to benefit from the overall growth in our markets. We seek to build relationships with new customers, maintain and even improve our relationships with existing customers, and encourage our bankers to be involved in their communities. We expect our bankers to recognize business development efforts and to maintain healthy relationships with clients, and our philosophy is to be responsive to customer needs by providing decisions in a timely manner. In addition to our business development efforts, many of the markets that we serve have shown signs of economic recovery over the last few years. 
 The following table provides a summary of the loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023.

In this context, a real estate loan is defined as any loan, secured by real estate, regardless of the purpose of the loan. It is common practice for financial institutions in our market areas, and for our Bank, to obtain a security interest or lien in real estate whenever possible, in addition to any other available collateral. This collateral is taken to reinforce the likelihood of the ultimate repayment of the loan and tends to increase the magnitude of the real estate loan portfolio component. In general, we prefer real estate collateral to many other potential collateral sources, such as accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. 
 46 

Real estate loans are the largest component of our loan portfolio and include residential real estate loans, commercial real estate loans, and construction and land development loans. At September 30, 2024, this category totaled 1.86 billion, or 76.28 of total gross loans, compared to 1.72 billion, or 76.60 , at December 31, 2023. Real estate loans increased 133.1 million, or 7.73 , during the period December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. Commercial loans increased 27.6 million, or 7.36 during the same period. Our management team and lending officers have a great deal of experience and expertise in real estate lending and commercial lending. 
 The federal regulatory agencies issued two guidance documents that have a significant impact on real estate related lending and, thus, on the operations of the Bank. One part of the guidance could require lenders to restrict lending secured primarily by certain categories of commercial real estate to a level of 300 of their capital or to raise additional capital. This factor, combined with the current economic environment, could affect the Bank s lending strategy away from, or to limit its expansion of, commercial real estate lending, which has been a material part of River Financial Corporation s lending strategy. This could also have a negative impact on our lending and profitability. Management actively monitors the composition of the Bank s loan portfolio, focusing on concentrations of credit, and the results of that monitoring activity are periodically reported to the Board of Directors. 
 The other guidance relates to the structuring of certain types of mortgages that allow negative amortization of consumer mortgage loans. Although the Bank does not engage at present in lending using these types of instruments, the guidance could have the effect of making the Bank less competitive in consumer mortgage lending if the local market is driving the demand for such an offering. 
 The repayment of loans is a source of additional liquidity for us. The following table sets forth our variable rate and fixed rate loans maturing within specific intervals at September 30, 2024.

The information presented in the table above is based upon the contractual maturities of the individual loans, which may be subject to renewal at their contractual maturity. Renewal of such loans is subject to review and credit approval, as well as modification of terms at their maturity. Consequently, we believe that this treatment presents fairly the maturity structure of the loan portfolio.

Allowance for Credit Losses, Provision for Credit Losses and Asset Quality 
 Allowance for credit losses and provision for credit losses 
 The allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of expected inherent credit losses in the loan portfolio. Management determines the allowance based on an ongoing evaluation of risk as it correlates to potential losses within the portfolio. Increases to the allowance for credit losses are made by charges to the provision for credit losses. Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance. Recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are credited to the allowance for credit losses. 
 
 The Bank recognizes that all significant factors that affect the collectability of the loan portfolio must be considered to determine the estimated credit losses as of the evaluation date. Furthermore, the methodology, in and of itself and even when selectively adjusted by comparison to market and peer data, does not provide a sufficient basis to determine the estimated credit losses. The Bank adjusts the modeled historical losses by a qualitative adjustment to incorporate all significant risks to form a sufficient basis to estimate the credit losses. These qualitative adjustments may increase or reduce reserve levels and include adjustments for lending management experience, loan review and audit results, asset quality and portfolio trends, loan portfolio growth, and concentrations, trends in underlying collateral, as well as external factors and economic conditions not already captured. 
 
 Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Generally, this population includes loans on non-accrual status, however, they can also include any loan that does not share risk characteristics with its respective pool. When management determines that foreclosure is probable and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, the expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date unadjusted for selling costs as appropriate. When the expected source of repayment is from a source other than the underlying collateral, impairment will generally be measured based on the present value of expected proceeds discounted at the contractual interest rate. 
 Management believes the data it uses in determining the allowance for credit losses is sufficient to estimate potential losses in the loan portfolio; however, actual results could differ from management s estimate.

Accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when management believes, after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts, that the borrower s financial condition is such that the collection of interest is doubtful. In addition to consideration of these factors, loans that are past due 90 days or more are generally placed on nonaccrual status. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all accrued interest on the loan is reversed and deducted from earnings as a reduction of reported interest income. No additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain. Payments received while a loan is on nonaccrual status will generally be applied to the outstanding principal balance. When a problem loan is finally resolved, there may ultimately be an actual write-down or charge-off of the principal balance of the loan that would necessitate additional charges to the allowance for credit losses. The nonperforming loans classification is made up of all loans 90 days or most past due and loans on nonaccrual status.

Deposits 
 Deposits, which include noninterest bearing demand deposits, interest bearing demand deposits, money market accounts, savings accounts, and time deposits, are the principal source of funds for the Bank. We offer a variety of products designed to attract and retain customers, with primary focus on building and expanding client relationships. Management continues to focus on establishing a comprehensive relationship with consumer and business borrowers, seeking deposits as well as lending relationships. 
 The following table details the composition of our deposit portfolio as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023.

Total deposits were 3.04 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 308.2 million from December 31, 2023 with the increase resulting mainly in the balances of interest bearing demand deposits, money market accounts, and time deposit accounts. Some of our demand deposit accounts are seasonal and have expected balance fluctuations. The seasonality of these demand deposits is related to property tax collections and to agricultural production.

Other Funding Sources 
 We supplement our deposit funding with wholesale funding when needed for balance sheet planning and management or when the terms are attractive and will not disrupt our offering rates in our markets. A source we have used for wholesale funding is the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (FHLB). The line of credit with the FHLB is secured by pledges of various loans in our loan portfolio. At September 30, 2024, the FHLB line of credit available was 253.9 million and at December 31, 2023 it was 210.3 million. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 150 million and 230 million Federal Home Loan Bank advances outstanding, respectively. We also have lines of credit for federal funds borrowings with other banks that totaled 100.0 million and 88.5 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Furthermore, we have pledged certain loans to the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) to secure a line of credit. At September 30, 2024, the FRB line of credit available was 409.4 million and at December 31, 2023, the FRB line of credit available was 157.6 million. Another source that we have used for wholesale funding is the Federal Reserve Bank discount window. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no borrowings outstanding with the Federal Reserve Bank discount window. 
 On August 9, 2021, the Company entered into a line of credit agreement with ServisFirst Bank for 10 million. The line of credit agreement was amended on March 17, 2023 to increase the line to 20 million. The line of credit is to be used for general capital needs and investments. The line, when drawn, will require quarterly payments of interest only. The line of credit was amended on March 15, 2024 and extended the maturity date 24 months to March 15, 2026. Additionally, the amendment dated March 15, 2024 increased the interest rate float at Wall Street Journal Prime with a floor of 4.50 up from 3.25 . The line of credit is secured by 51 of the Bank's stock. 
 On March 9, 2021, River Financial Corporation the Company entered into a Subordinated Note Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement with the purchasers signatory thereto providing for a private placement of 40 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.00 fixed-to-floating rate Subordinated Notes due March 15, 2031 (the Notes ). The Notes were issued by the Company to the purchasers at a price equal to 100 of their face amount. Interest on the Notes will accrue from March 9, 2021, and the Company will pay interest semi-annually on March 15th and September 15 th of each year, beginning on September 15, 2021, until the Notes mature. The Notes will bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.00 per year, from and including March 9, 2021 to, but excluding, March 15, 2026. From and including March 15, 2026, but excluding the maturity date or early redemption date, the interest rate will reset quarterly at a variable rate equal to the then current three-month term SOFR plus 342 basis points. The Notes may not be prepaid by the Company prior to March 15, 2026. From and after March 15, 2026, the Company may prepay all or, from time to time, any part of the Notes at 100 of the principal amount (plus accrued interest) without penalty, subject to any requirement under Federal Reserve Board regulations to obtain prior approval from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System before making any prepayment. The Notes may also be prepaid by the Company at any time after the occurrence of an event that would preclude the Notes from being included in the Tier 2 Capital of the Company. The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, and affirmative and negative covenants, including the requirement that, subject to certain limitations, the Company restructure any portion of the Notes that ceases to be deemed Tier 2 Capital. The Company used approximately 19.7 million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes to pay off its note with CenterState Bank dated October 31, 2018, including interest accrued on such notes, and the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, including providing capital to support the organic growth of its bank subsidiary, River Bank. 
 On December 15, 2023, the Bank entered into an irrevocable standby letter of credit agreement with the FHLB for 75 million issued in favor of the Alabama State Treasurer, SAFE Program. The letter of credit agreement was amended on June 24, 2024 to increase the amount to 200 million. The letter of credit agreement was amended on September 13, 2024 to decrease the amount to 175 million. The Bank is charged 0.09 on the amount of the irrevocable standby letter of credit. The letter of credit shall remain in effect until terminated by either the Bank or the Institution upon written notice to the other party.

Liquidity 
 Market and public confidence in our financial strength and financial institutions in general will largely determine our access to appropriate levels of liquidity. This confidence is significantly dependent on our ability to maintain sound asset quality and appropriate levels of capital reserves. 
 Liquidity is defined as the ability to meet anticipated customer demands for funds under credit commitments and deposit withdrawals at a reasonable cost and on a timely basis. We measure our liquidity position by giving consideration to both on- and off-balance sheet sources of and demands for funds on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. 
 Liquidity risk involves the risk of being unable to fund assets with the appropriate duration and rate-based liabilities, as well as the risk of not being able to meet unexpected cash needs. Liquidity planning and management are necessary to ensure the ability to fund operations cost-effectively and to meet current and future potential obligations such as loan commitments and unexpected deposit outflows. In this process, we focus on assets and liabilities and on the manner in which they combine to provide adequate liquidity to meet our needs. 
 Funds are available from a number of basic banking activity sources, including the core deposit base, the repayment and maturity of loans, and investment cash flows. Other funding sources include federal funds borrowings, brokered certificates of deposit and borrowings from the FHLB and FRB. 
 Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, were 147.1 million and 72.6 million, respectively. Based on recorded cash and cash equivalents, management believes River Financial Corporation s liquidity resources were sufficient at September 30, 2024 to fund loans and meet other cash needs as necessary. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 The Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Such instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized by the balance sheet. The contract amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the Company has in particular classes of financial instruments. 
 
 The exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments. In most cases, the Company requires collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk. 
 Financial instruments whose contract amount represents credit risk at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows (amounts in thousands):

Capital Position and Dividends 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, total stockholders equity was 233.3 million and 198.3 million, respectively. The increase of approximately 35.0 million resulted mainly from the net change in retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Retained earnings for the first nine months of 2024 increased 18.3 million while accumulated other comprehensive loss also decreased 17.0 million. The ratio of stockholders equity to total assets was 6.67 and 6.13 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 River Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Certain items such as goodwill and other intangible assets are deducted from total capital in arriving at the various regulatory capital measures such as Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital, and total risk-based capital. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on River Financial Corporation s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, River Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the bank s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory regulations and guidelines. River Bank s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. 
 River Bank is eligible to utilize the community bank leverage ratio (CBLR) framework. The Bank has evaluated this option and has elected not to utilize the CBLR framework at this time, but may do so in the future. 
 55 

Quantitative measures, established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy, require River Financial Corporation and River Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total risk based capital, Common Equity Tier 1 capital, and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined in the regulations), and of Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to average assets (as defined in the regulations). 
 Management believes, as of September 30, 2024, that the Company and Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject. The following table presents the Company's and Bank s capital amounts and ratios as of September 30, 2024 with the required minimum levels for capital adequacy purposes including the capital conservation buffer under Basel III and minimum levels to be well capitalized (as defined) under the regulatory prompt corrective action regulations.

River Financial Corporation s principal source of funds for dividend payments and debt service is dividends received from River Bank. There are statutory limitations on the payment of dividends by River Bank to River Financial Corporation. As of September 30, 2024, the maximum amount the Bank could dividend to River Financial Corporation without prior regulatory authority approval was approximately 61.9 million. In addition to dividend restrictions, federal statutes prohibit unsecured loans from banks to bank holding companies. 
 
 During the nine months ending September 30, 2024 there were 9,000 incentive stock options issued with a weighted average exercise price of 32.33 per share. During the same period, there were 9,293 incentive stock options exercised at a weighted average exercise price of 23.35 per share. During the same period, there were 1,200 incentive stock options forfeited at a weighted average exercise price of 31.99. A total of 336,244 incentive stock options were outstanding as of September 30, 2024 with a weighted average exercise price of 25.50 per share and a weighted average remaining life of 4.47 years. 
 
 During the nine months ending September 30, 2024 there were no restricted stock grants issued. During the same time period, there were 14,450 stock grants that vested with a weighted average exercise price of 31.83. During the same time period, there were 1,050 stock grants forfeited with a weighted average exercise price of 31.20. A total of 50,233 restricted stock grants remained nonvested as of September 30, 2024 with a weighted average exercise price of 32.02 per share and a weighted average remaining life of 2.26 years.

Interest Sensitivity and Market Risk 
 Management monitors and manages the pricing and maturity of our assets and liabilities in order to diminish the potential adverse impact that changes in interest rates could have on net interest income. The principal monitoring technique employed by the Bank is simulation analysis. 
 In simulation analysis, we review each asset and liability category and its projected behavior in various different interest rate environments. These projected behaviors are based on management s past experience and on current competitive environments, including the various environments in the different markets in which we compete. Using projected behavior and differing rate scenarios as inputs, the simulation analysis generates projections of net interest income. We also periodically verify the validity of this approach by comparing actual results with those that were projected in previous models. 
 Another technique used in interest rate management, but to a lesser degree than simulation analysis, is the measurement of the interest sensitivity gap , which is the positive or negative dollar difference between assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate repricing within a given period of time. Interest rate sensitivity can be managed by repricing assets and liabilities, selling securities available for sale, replacing an asset or liability at maturity or by adjusting the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability. 
 We evaluate interest rate sensitivity risk and then formulate guidelines regarding asset generation and repricing, and sources and prices of off-balance sheet commitments in order to maintain interest sensitivity risk at levels deemed prudent by management. We use computer simulations to measure the net income effect of various rate scenarios. The modeling reflects interest rate changes and the related impact on net income over specified periods of time. 
 The following table illustrates our interest rate sensitivity at September 30, 2024, assuming the relevant assets and liabilities are collected and paid, respectively, based upon historical experience rather than their stated maturities (amounts in thousands).

The Bank generally benefits from increasing market interest rates when it has an asset-sensitive gap (a positive number) and generally benefits from decreasing market interest rates when it is liability sensitive (a negative number). As shown in the table above, the Bank is asset sensitive on a cumulative basis throughout the one to two year time frame. The interest sensitivity analysis presents only a static view of the timing and repricing opportunities, without taking into consideration that changes in interest rates do not affect all assets and liabilities equally. For example, rates paid on a substantial portion of core deposits may change contractually within a relatively short time frame, but those are viewed by management as significantly less interest sensitive than market-based rates such as those paid on non-core deposits. For this and other reasons, management relies more upon the simulations analysis (as noted above) in managing interest rate risk. Net interest income may be impacted by other significant factors in a given interest rate environment, including changes in volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. 
 58 

The Bank s earnings are dependent, to a large degree, on its net interest income, which is the difference between interest income earned on all interest earning assets, primarily loans and securities, and interest paid on all interest bearing liabilities, primarily deposits. Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our market risk arises primarily from inherent interest rate risk in our lending, investing and deposit gathering activities. We seek to reduce our exposure to market risk through actively monitoring and managing interest rate risk. Management relies on simulations analysis to evaluate the impact of varying levels of prevailing interest rates and the sensitivity of specific earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to changes in those prevailing rates. Simulation analysis consists of evaluating the impact on net interest income given changes from 400 basis points below the current prevailing rates to 400 basis points above current prevailing interest rates. Management makes certain assumptions as to the effect varying levels of interest rates have on certain interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, which assumptions consider both historical experience and consensus estimates of outside sources. 
 The following table illustrates the results of our simulation analysis to determine the extent to which market risk would affect net interest income for the next twelve months if prevailing interest rates increased or decreased by the specified amounts from current rates. As noted above, this model uses estimates and assumptions in asset and liability account rate reactions to changes in prevailing interest rates. However, to isolate the market risk inherent in the balance sheet, the model assumes that no growth in the balance sheet occurs during the projection period. This model also assumes an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates, which would result in no change in the shape or slope of the interest rate yield curve. Because of the inherent use of the estimates and assumptions in the simulation model to derive this market risk information, the actual results of the future impact of market risk on our net interest income may differ from that found in the table. Given the current level of prevailing interest rates, management believes prevailing market rates falling 300 basis points and 400 basis points are not reasonable assumptions. All other simulated prevailing interest rates changes modeled indicate a level of sensitivity of the Bank s net interest income to those changes that is acceptable to management and within established Bank policy limits as of both dates shown.
