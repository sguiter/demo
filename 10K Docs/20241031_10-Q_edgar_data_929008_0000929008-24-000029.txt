In the first quarter of 2024, Wesco entered into an agreement to sell the WIS business. The sale was completed on April 1, 2024. 
 Overall Financial Performance 
 Our financial results for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 reflect a single-digit decline in sales driven by a decrease in volume partially offset by the benefits of price inflation in certain segments. Additionally, financial results were impacted by a loss on abandonment of assets, higher facilities and IT costs and higher payroll and payroll-related expenses, partially offset by the gain recognized on the divestiture of our WIS business, as well as lower professional services and consulting fees. 
 Net sales for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 592.7 million, or 3.5 , over the corresponding prior year period. The decrease reflects estimated volume decline of approximately 3 driven primarily by a decrease in volume for the UBS segment, with a less significant decrease in the EES segment, partially offset by an increase in the CSS segment. Other negative factors include the decrease from the divestiture of the WIS business of 2.3 and the negative impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates of 0.2 . These negative factors were partially offset by the favorable impact from the number of workdays of 0.5 and by the estimated impact of changes in price of approximately 2 . Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was 78.3 for the current and prior year nine-month period. 
 Income from operations was 922.1 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 1,090.7 million for the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of 168.6 million, or 15.5 . Income from operations as a percentage of net sales was 5.7 for the current nine-month period, compared to 6.4 for the first nine months of the prior year. Income from operations for the first nine months of 2024 includes a loss on abandonment of assets of 17.8 million as a result of the write-off of certain capitalized cloud computing arrangement implementation costs relating to a third-party developed operations management software product that will no longer be utilized, digital transformation costs of 17.5 million, restructuring costs of 9.5 million, and excise taxes on excess pension plan assets of 4.8 million. Adjusted for these amounts, income from operations was 6.0 of net sales for the first nine months of 2024. For the first nine months of 2023, income from operations was 6.8 of net sales, as adjusted for digital transformation costs of 28.5 million, merger-related and integration costs of 16.9 million, restructuring costs of 15.4 million, and accelerated trademark amortization of 1.2 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, income from operations declined compared to the prior year due to a decline in sales, as well as an increase in costs to operate our facilities, an increase in IT costs and higher payroll and payroll-related expenses. These negative factors were partially offset by a decrease in professional services and consulting fees.

Cash Flow 
 Operating cash flow for the first nine months of 2024 was 824.6 million. Net cash provided by operating activities included net income of 553.5 million and non-cash adjustments to net income totaling 66.3 million, which primarily comprised depreciation and amortization of 137.6 million, stock-based compensation expense of 19.6 million, a loss on abandonment of assets of 17.8 million and amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs of 12.2 million, partially offset by a gain of 122.2 million, resulting from the divestiture of our WIS business, as described in Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures . Operating cash flow was positively impacted by net changes in assets and liabilities of 204.8 million, which primarily comprised an increase in accounts payable of 478.0 million, primarily due to the timing of payments to suppliers, as well as inventory purchases, partially offset by an increase in trade accounts receivable of 217.9 million due to the timing of receipts from customers. Operating cash flow was also negatively impacted by the payment of management incentive compensation earned in 2023, which resulted in a cash outflow of approximately 50.5 million in the first nine months of 2024, which was partially offset by the accrual of management incentive compensation earned in the current year. 
 Investing activities primarily included 354.9 million in proceeds from the divestiture of the WIS business, net of cash transferred, partially offset by 70.4 million of capital expenditures mostly consisting of internal-use computer software and information technology hardware to support our digital transformation initiatives, as well as equipment and leasehold improvements to support our global network of locations, and 41.7 million paid in the aggregate to acquire the entroCIM business entroCIM and Independent Electric Supply Inc. IES ), net of cash acquired. 
 Financing activities primarily comprised the redemption of our 1,500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.125 Senior Notes due 2025 (the 2025 Notes ), and proceeds of 900.0 million and 850.0 million related to the issuance of our 6.375 Senior Notes due 2029 (the 2029 Notes and our 6.625 Senior Notes due 2032 (the 2032 Notes and, together with the 2029 Notes, the 2029 and 2032 Notes ), respectively.

The first nine months of 2024 also included 375.0 million of common stock repurchases, 61.4 million and 43.1 million of dividends paid to holders of our common stock and Series A Preferred Stock, respectively, and 26.2 million of payments for taxes related to the exercise and vesting of stock-based awards. 
 Financing Availability 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 1.2 billion in total available borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility and 100.0 million of available borrowing capacity under our Receivables Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility and the Receivables Facility both mature in March 2027.

 Cost of Goods Sold 
 Cost of goods sold for the third quarter of 2024 was 4.3 billion compared to 4.4 billion for the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 0.1 billion. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was 77.9 and 78.4 for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively.

SG A expenses for the third quarter of 2024 include 5.4 million of digital transformation costs and 0.5 million of restructuring costs. SG A expenses for the third quarter of 2023 include 12.9 million of digital transformation costs, 5.6 million of restructuring costs, and 2.1 million of merger-related and integration costs. Adjusted for digital transformation costs and restructuring costs, SG A expenses were 825.2 million, or 15.0 of net sales, for the third quarter of 2024. Adjusted for digital transformation costs, restructuring costs, and merger-related and integration costs, SG A expenses were 775.8 million, or 13.7 of net sales, for the third quarter of 2023. 
 SG A payroll and payroll-related expenses for the third quarter of 2024 of 520.1 million increased by 13.5 million compared to the same period in 2023 as a result of an increase of 9.6 million in commissions and incentives and a 9.6 million increase in benefits, partially offset by a decrease in other payroll expenses of 3.3 million, primarily driven by a reduction in long-term incentive plan expense. 
 SG A expenses not related to payroll and payroll-related costs for the third quarter of 2024 were 311.0 million, an increase of 21.2 million compared to the same period in 2023, which primarily reflects higher costs to operate our facilities of 7.0 million, higher transportation costs of 4.5 million, higher employee expenses of 3.3 million, and higher IT costs of 3.2 million. 
 Income from Operations 
 Income from operations was 335.6 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 380.5 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease of 44.9 million, or 11.8 , reflects a decrease in sales due to volume declines and an increase in SG A expenses as described above, partially offset by lower cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales, as described above. 
 Interest Expense, net 
 Net interest expense totaled 86.5 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 98.5 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease of 12.0 million, or 12.1 , primarily reflects lower borrowings and a decrease in variable interest rates. 
 Other (Income) Expense, net 
 Other non-operating income totaled 24.9 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to expense of 3.7 million for the third quarter of 2023. During the third quarter, we finalized the divestiture of our WIS business and recognized an additional gain from the sale of 19.3 million. Due to fluctuations in the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies, we recognized a net foreign currency exchange gain of 2.5 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to a net loss of 1.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. We recognized net benefits of 2.4 million and 0.2 million associated with the non-service cost components of net periodic pension cost (benefit) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The non-service cost components of net periodic pension benefit for the third quarter of 2024 includes income of 2.2 million as a result of the finalization of the liabilities transferred as part of the settlement of the Anixter Inc. Pension Plan. Adjusted for the gain on the divestiture of our WIS business as well as the pension settlement cost reduction, other non-operating income was 3.4 million for the third quarter of 2024.

Income Taxes 
 The provision for income taxes was 69.3 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 44.3 million for the corresponding quarter of the prior year, resulting in effective tax rates of 25.3 and 15.9 , respectively. The higher effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 is due to lower discrete income tax benefits resulting from the exercise and vesting of stock-based awards as compared to the prior year. The corresponding quarter of the prior year also reflected discrete income tax benefits relating to the reversal of the valuation allowance against Brazilian deferred tax assets and 2022 U.S. federal return-to-provision adjustments. 
 Net Income and Earnings per Share 
 Net income and earnings per diluted share attributable to common stockholders were 189.9 million and 3.81, respectively, for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 219.0 million and 4.20, respectively, for the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted for digital transformation costs, restructuring costs, the additional gain recognized on the divestiture of the WIS business, the pension settlement cost reduction, and the related income tax effects, net income and earnings per diluted share attributable to common stockholders were 178.1 million and 3.58, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Adjusted for digital transformation costs, restructuring costs, merger-related and integration costs, accelerated trademark amortization expense, and the related income tax effects, net income and earnings per diluted share attributable to common stockholders were 234.4 million and 4.49, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was 398.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 457.0 million for the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 58.9 million, or 12.9 year-over-year. The decrease primarily reflects the 155.0 million decrease in net sales and a 34.7 million increase in SG A expenses, partially offset by a corresponding decrease in cost of goods sold of 145.7 million, as described above. Included in the increase in SG A expenses was cloud computing arrangement amortization of 3.8 million, partially offset by the lack of merger-related and integration costs in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2.1 million in the third quarter of 2023, as well as a year-over-year decrease in digital transformation and restructuring costs of 7.5 million and 5.1 million, respectively. 
 Segment Results 
 The following is a discussion of the financial results of our operating segments comprising three strategic business units consisting of EES, CSS and UBS for the three months ended September 30, 2024. As further described below and in Note 14, Business Segments of our Notes to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the performance of our operating segments is based on net sales, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin percentage. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin percentage are non-GAAP financial measures.

 Three Months Ended Growth/(Decline) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Reported Divestiture Foreign Exchange Workday Organic Sales (In millions) Net sales 2,151.2 2,190.7 (1.8) (0.5) 1.6 (2.9) Adjusted EBITDA 186.3 191.5 Adjusted EBITDA Margin 8.7 8.7 
 EES reported net sales of 2,151.2 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2,190.7 million for the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 39.5 million, or 1.8 . Adjusting for the unfavorable impact from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates of 0.5 and the favorable impact from the number of workdays of 1.6 , EES organic sales for the third quarter of 2024 declined by 2.9 , reflecting volume declines of approximately 6 , primarily as a result of declines in the construction and industrial businesses. The decline in volume was partially offset by the impact of changes in price, which favorably impacted organic sales by approximately 3 . 
 EES reported adjusted EBITDA of 186.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, or 8.7 of net sales, compared to 191.5 million for the third quarter of 2023, or 8.7 of net sales. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 5.2 million, or 2.7 year-over-year. The decrease primarily reflects the 39.5 million decline in net sales, as described above, offset by a decrease in cost of goods sold of 49.4 million, which is inclusive of higher supplier volume rebates of approximately 6.1 million. SG A expenses increased 15.2 million as compared to the prior year, which was primarily attributed to an increase in commissions and incentives of 6.9 million, an increase in salaries of 6.1 million, and an increase in transportation costs of 4.5 million.

 Three Months Ended Growth/(Decline) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Reported Divestiture Foreign Exchange Workday Organic Sales (In millions) Net sales 1,955.1 1,778.0 10.0 (0.1) 1.6 8.5 Adjusted EBITDA 175.2 175.5 Adjusted EBITDA Margin 9.0 9.9 
 CSS reported net sales of 1,955.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 1,778.0 million for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 177.1 million, or 10.0 . Adjusting for the unfavorable impact from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates of 0.1 and the favorable impact from the number of workdays of 1.6 , CSS organic sales for the third quarter of 2024 grew by 8.5 , primarily reflecting volume growth in the data center solutions and security solutions businesses. Changes in price did not have a material impact on the year-over-year growth in CSS organic sales. 
 CSS reported adjusted EBITDA of 175.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, or 9.0 of net sales, compared to 175.5 million for the third quarter of 2023, or 9.9 of net sales. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 0.3 million, or 0.2 year-over-year. The decrease primarily reflects an increase in cost of goods sold of 155.2 million and an increase in SG A expenses of 22.7 million, partially offset by the 177.1 million increase in net sales, as described above. The increase in SG A expenses is primarily attributed to increased salaries of 6.4 million, increased commissions and incentives of 5.5 million, driven by higher sales volume, a 2.5 million increase in transportation costs consistent with higher sales, and higher costs to operate our facilities of 2.1 million, which includes an increase in rents.

 UBS reported net sales of 1,383.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 1,675.7 million for the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 292.6 million, or 17.5 . Adjusting for the decrease from the divestiture of the WIS business of 11.7 , the unfavorable impact from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates of 0.2 , and the favorable impact from the number of workdays of 1.6 , UBS organic sales for the third quarter of 2024 declined by 7.2 , reflecting volume declines of approximately 9 , primarily as a result of declines in the utility and broadband businesses. The decline in volume was partially offset by the impact of changes in price, which favorably impacted organic sales by approximately 1 . 
 UBS reported adjusted EBITDA of 156.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, or 11.3 of net sales, compared to 196.4 million for the third quarter of 2023, or 11.7 of net sales. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 39.9 million, or 20.3 year-over-year. The decrease primarily reflects the 292.6 million decline in net sales, as described above, partially offset by a decrease in cost of goods sold of 251.5 million, which is inclusive of higher inventory adjustments of 3.4 million as well as lower supplier volume rebates of 6.9 million. SG A expenses decreased 1.0 million as compared to the prior year.

 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net Sales 
 The following table sets forth net sales and organic sales growth for the periods presented: 
 Nine Months Ended Growth/(Decline) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Reported Divestiture Foreign Exchange 
 Workday 
 Organic Sales 
 (In millions) Net sales 16,319.1 16,911.8 (3.5) (2.3) (0.2) 0.5 (1.5) 
 Note: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure of sales performance. Organic sales growth is calculated by deducting the percentage impact from acquisitions and divestitures for one year following the respective transaction, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and number of workdays from the reported percentage change in consolidated net sales. Workday impact represents the change in the number of operating days period-over-period after adjusting for weekends and public holidays in the United States; the first nine months of 2024 had one more workday compared to the first nine months of 2023. 
 Net sales were 16.3 billion for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 16.9 billion for the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of 3.5 . Adjusting for the decrease from the divestiture of the WIS business of 2.3 , the unfavorable impact from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates of 0.2 , and the favorable impact from the number of workdays of 0.5 , organic sales for the first nine months of 2024 declined by 1.5 , reflecting an approximately 3 decline in volume, driven by declines in the EES and UBS segments, partially offset by a volume increase in the CSS segment, and the impact of changes in price, which favorably impacted consolidated organic sales by approximately 2 . 
 Cost of Goods Sold 
 Cost of goods sold for the first nine months of 2024 was 12.8 billion compared to 13.2 billion for the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of 0.4 billion. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was 78.3 for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 SG A expenses primarily include payroll and payroll-related costs, shipping and handling, travel and entertainment, facilities, utilities, information technology expenses, professional and consulting fees, credit losses, gains (losses) on the sale, disposal, or abandonment of property and equipment, as well as real estate and personal property taxes. SG A expenses for the first nine months of 2024 totaled 2,488.9 million versus 2,445.8 million for the first nine months of 2023, an increase of 43.1 million, or 1.8 . As a percentage of net sales, SG A expenses were 15.3 and 14.5 for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. SG A expenses for the first nine months of 2024 include a 17.8 million loss on abandonment of assets, 17.5 million of digital transformation costs, 9.5 million of restructuring costs, and 4.8 million of excise taxes on excess pension plan assets. SG A expenses for first nine months of 2023 include 28.5 million of digital transformation costs, 16.9 million of merger-related and integration costs, and 15.4 million of restructuring costs. Adjusted for the loss on abandonment of assets, digital transformation costs, restructuring costs, and excise taxes on excess pension plan assets, SG A expenses were 2,439.3 million, or 14.9 of net sales, for the first nine months of 2024. Adjusted for digital transformation costs, merger-related and integration costs, and restructuring costs, SG A expenses were 2,385.0 million, or 14.1 of net sales, for the first nine months of 2023. 
 SG A payroll and payroll-related expenses for the first nine months of 2024 of 1,550.8 million increased by 8.5 million compared to the same period in 2023 primarily as a result of higher salaries of 6.9 million due to wage inflation, partially offset by the impact of headcount reduction actions taken at the end of the second quarter of 2023 and the impact of the divestiture of the WIS business. Additional factors include an increase to commissions and incentive compensation expenses of 18.7 million, and an increase to benefit expenses of 8.9 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in other payroll expenses of 16.1 million, primarily driven by a reduction in long-term incentive plan expense, as well as a decrease of 9.9 million in temporary labor expense. 
 SG A expenses not related to payroll and payroll-related costs for the first nine months of 2024 were 938.1 million, an increase of 34.6 million compared to the same period in 2023, which primarily reflects an increase of 21.6 million in other income and deductions, driven by the loss on abandonment of assets, higher costs to operate our facilities of 21.6 million, an increase of 11.2 million in IT costs, and an increase of 6.6 million in taxes. These increases were partially offset by a 16.5 million decrease in professional service and consulting fees, including decreases in merger-related and integration costs and costs related to digital transformation initiatives, and a decrease of 6.2 million in transportation costs due to the decrease in sales volume noted above. 
 Income from Operations 
 Income from operations was 922.1 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 1,090.7 million for the first nine months of 2023. The decrease of 168.6 million, or 15.5 , reflects a decrease in sales due to volume declines, and higher SG A expenses, as described above. 
 Interest Expense, net 
 Net interest expense totaled 279.8 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 292.3 million for the first nine months of 2023. The decrease of 12.5 million, or 4.3 , primarily reflects lower borrowings, partially due to the redemption of the 2025 Notes in the second quarter of 2024, and a decrease in variable interest rates. 
 Other (Income) Expense, net 
 Other non-operating income totaled 99.3 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to expense of 14.6 million for the first nine months of 2023. In the first nine months of 2024, we completed the divestiture of our WIS business and recognized a gain from the sale of 122.2 million. Additionally, in the first nine months of 2024, we recognized a 3.8 million loss on termination of a business arrangement. Due to fluctuations in the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies, we recognized a net foreign currency exchange loss of 18.2 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to a net loss of 14.6 million for the first nine months of 2023. We recognized net costs of 3.2 million and net benefits of 0.9 million associated with the non-service cost components of net periodic pension cost (benefit) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The year-over-year increase in net periodic pension costs was due to pension settlement cost to recognize unrealized losses previously reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) related to the benefit obligation of the Anixter Inc. Pension Plan as a result of the final settlement of the plan in the first quarter of 2024. Adjusted for the gain on the divestiture of our WIS business, the loss on termination of a business arrangement, and the 3.3 million pension settlement cost described above, other non-operating expense was 15.8 million for the first nine months of 2024.

Income Taxes 
 The provision for income taxes was 188.1 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 160.2 million in last year's comparable period, resulting in effective tax rates of 25.4 and 20.4 , respectively. The higher effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 is due to lower discrete income tax benefits resulting from the exercise and vesting of stock-based awards as compared to the prior year period. The prior year period also reflected discrete income tax benefits relating to the reversal of the valuation allowance against Brazilian deferred tax assets and 2022 U.S. federal return-to-provision adjustments. 
 Net Income and Earnings per Share 
 Net income and earnings per diluted share attributable to common stockholders were 509.1 million and 10.02, respectively, for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 580.5 million and 11.08, respectively, for the first nine months of 2023. Adjusted for the loss on abandonment of assets, digital transformation costs, restructuring costs, excise taxes on excess pension plan assets, the gain recognized on the divestiture of the WIS business, the loss on termination of a business arrangement, pension settlement cost, and the related income tax effects, net income and earnings per diluted share attributable to common stockholders were 461.0 million and 9.07, respectively, for the first nine months of 2024. Adjusted for digital transformation costs, merger-related and integration costs, restructuring costs, accelerated trademark amortization expense, and the related income tax effects, net income and earnings per diluted share attributable to common stockholders were 625.7 million and 11.94, respectively, for the first nine months of 2023. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was 1,138.6 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 1,320.0 million for the first nine months of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 181.4 million, or 13.7 year-over-year. The decrease primarily reflects the 592.7 million decrease in net sales, and a 43.1 million increase in SG A expenses, partially offset by a corresponding decrease in cost of goods sold of 468.4 million, as described above. Included in the increase in SG A expenses were the loss on abandonment of assets of 17.8 million, cloud computing arrangement amortization of 9.7 million, and excise taxes on excess pension plan assets of 4.8 million, partially offset by the lack of merger-related and integration costs in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 16.9 million in the first nine months of 2023, as well as a year-over-year decrease in digital transformation and restructuring costs of 11.0 million and 5.9 million, respectively.

 EES reported net sales of 6,423.1 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 6,526.1 million for the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of 103.0 million, or 1.6 . Adjusting for the unfavorable impact from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates of 0.3 and the favorable impact from the number of workdays of 0.5 , EES organic sales for the first nine months of 2024 declined by 1.8 , reflecting volume declines of approximately 4 , primarily as a result of a decline in the construction business. The decline in volume was partially offset by the impact of changes in price, which favorably impacted organic sales by approximately 3 . 
 EES reported adjusted EBITDA of 547.0 million for the first nine months of 2024, or 8.5 of net sales, compared to 563.5 million for the first nine months of 2023, or 8.6 of net sales. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 16.5 million, or 2.9 year-over-year. The decrease primarily reflects the 103.0 million decrease in net sales, as described above, partially offset by a corresponding decrease in cost of goods sold of 90.6 million, which is inclusive of lower supplier volume rebates of approximately 4.2 million. SG A expenses increased 3.6 million as compared to the prior year, which was primarily attributed to an increase in commissions and incentives of 13.6 million, and an increase in transportation costs of 2.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in benefits of 7.4 million and a decrease in bad debt expense of 5.5 million.

Adjusting for the unfavorable impact from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates of 0.1 and the favorable impact from the number of workdays of 0.5 , CSS organic sales for the first nine months of 2024 grew by 2.0 , primarily as a result of growth in the data center solutions business, partially offset by volume declines in the security solutions and enterprise network infrastructure businesses. Changes in price did not have a material impact on the year-over-year increase in CSS organic sales. 
 CSS reported adjusted EBITDA of 453.2 million for the first nine months of 2024, or 8.3 of net sales, compared to 510.5 million for the first nine months of 2023, or 9.5 of net sales. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 57.3 million, or 11.2 year-over-year. The decrease reflects an increase in cost of goods sold of 157.2 million, which is inclusive of an increase in inventory adjustments of 8.3 million, and an increase in SG A expenses of 31.3 million, partially offset by an increase in net sales of 130.2 million, as described above. The increase in SG A expenses is primarily attributed to increased commissions and incentives of 8.9 million, higher salaries of 6.6 million, higher costs to operate our facilities of 5.4 million, which includes an increase in rents and the opening of a new facility, and higher benefits expense of 2.3 million.

Adjusting for the decrease from the divestiture of the WIS business of 7.9 and the favorable impact from the number of workdays of 0.5 , UBS organic sales for the first nine months of 2024 declined by 4.9 , reflecting volume declines of approximately 7 , primarily as a result of declines in the utility and broadband businesses. The decline in volume was partially offset by the impact of changes in price, which favorably impacted organic sales by approximately 2 . 
 UBS reported adjusted EBITDA of 499.4 million for the first nine months of 2024, or 11.3 of net sales, compared to 572.7 million for the first nine months of 2023, or 11.4 of net sales. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 73.3 million, or 12.8 year-over-year. The decrease primarily reflects the 619.9 million decrease in net sales, as described above, partially offset by a corresponding decrease in cost of goods sold of 535.0 million. SG A expenses decreased 11.5 million as compared to the prior year, which was primarily attributed to a decrease in commissions and incentives of 12.4 million, driven by lower sales volume and the impact of the WIS divestiture, a decrease in transportation costs of 3.2 million, driven by lower sales volume, partially offset by higher costs to operate our facilities of 7.7 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our liquidity needs generally arise from fluctuations in our working capital requirements, information technology investments, capital expenditures, acquisitions, the payment of dividends, and debt service obligations. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 1.2 billion in available borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility, after giving effect to outstanding letters of credit and certain borrowings under our international lines of credit, and 100.0 million of available borrowing capacity under our Receivables Facility, which combined with available cash of 370.0 million, provided liquidity of approximately 1.7 billion. Cash included in our determination of liquidity represents cash in certain deposit and interest-bearing investment accounts held in the United States and Canada. We monitor the depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a regular basis, and we believe that we have placed our deposits with creditworthy financial institutions. 
 As described in Note 9, Debt of our Notes to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, on March 7, 2024, Wesco Distribution issued 900 million aggregate principal amount of 2029 Notes and 850 million aggregate principal amount of 2032 Notes. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 and 2032 Notes to redeem the 1,500 million aggregate principal amount of 2025 Notes on June 17, 2024. Prior to redeeming the 2025 Notes, we used the net proceeds from the 2029 and 2032 Notes temporarily to repay a portion of the amounts outstanding under our Receivables Facility and repaid all of the outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. We subsequently redrew under our Receivables Facility and our Revolving Credit Facility an aggregate amount sufficient to redeem the 2025 Notes. 
 We regularly review our mix of fixed versus variable rate debt, and we may, from time to time, issue or retire borrowings and/or refinance existing debt in an effort to mitigate the impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and to maintain a cost-effective capital structure consistent with our anticipated capital requirements. Economic conditions contributed to increases in interest rates during 2023; however, interest rates have remained stable in 2024, and the Federal Reserve reduced its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points at the end of the third quarter. Future interest rate changes would raise or lower the rates we pay on our variable rate debt and would contribute to fluctuations in interest expense versus prior periods. 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 61 of our debt portfolio consisted of fixed rate debt. We believe our capital structure has an appropriate mix of fixed versus variable rate debt and secured versus unsecured instruments. 
 Over the next several quarters, we expect that our excess liquidity will be directed primarily at returning capital to shareholders through our existing share repurchase authorization, the payment of dividends, debt reduction, digital transformation initiatives, potential acquisitions and related integration activities, and/or the potential redemption of Series A Preferred Stock in 2025. We expect to maintain sufficient liquidity through our credit facilities and cash balances. We believe cash provided by operations and financing activities will be adequate to cover our operational and business needs for at least the next twelve months. 
 We communicate on a regular basis with our lenders regarding our financial and working capital performance, and liquidity position. We were in compliance with all financial covenants and restrictions contained in our debt agreements as of September 30, 2024. 
 We also measure our ability to meet our debt obligations based on our financial leverage ratio, which was 2.9x as of September 30, 2024 and 2.8x as of December 31, 2023.

 WESCO INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Note: Financial leverage ratio is a non-GAAP measure of the use of debt. Financial leverage ratio is calculated by dividing total debt, excluding debt discount, debt issuance costs and fair value adjustments, net of cash, by adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA is defined as the trailing twelve months earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as the trailing twelve months EBITDA before other non-operating expenses (income), non-cash stock-based compensation expense, merger-related and integration costs, restructuring costs, digital transformation costs, excise taxes on excess pension plan assets related to the final settlement of the Anixter Inc. Pension Plan, loss on abandonment of assets, and cloud computing arrangement amortization. 
 Most of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries have been taxed in the U.S. under either the one-time tax imposed on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings (the transition tax ), or the global intangible low-taxed income tax regime imposed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. However, the distribution of earnings by our foreign subsidiaries in the form of dividends, or otherwise, may be subject to additional taxation. We believe that we are able to maintain sufficient liquidity for our domestic operations and commitments without repatriating cash from our foreign subsidiaries. Therefore, we continue to assert that the remaining undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested. 
 We finance our operating and investing needs primarily with borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and Receivables Facility, as well as uncommitted lines of credit entered into by certain of our foreign subsidiaries to support local operations, some of which are overdraft facilities. The Revolving Credit Facility has a borrowing limit of 1,725 million and the purchase limit under the Receivables Facility is 1,550 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had 485.0 million outstanding on the Revolving Credit Facility and 1,450.0 million outstanding under the Receivables Facility. The maximum borrowing limits of our international lines of credit vary by facility and range between 0.6 million and 10.0 million. Our international lines of credit generally are renewable on an annual basis and certain facilities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Wesco Distribution. Accordingly, certain borrowings under these lines directly reduce availability under our Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, we had 0.8 million outstanding under our international lines of credit. 
 For information regarding amendments to the Receivables Facility and Revolving Credit Facility as well as disclosure of our debt instruments, including our outstanding indebtedness as of September 30, 2024, see Note 9, Debt of our Notes to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 An analysis of cash flow for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 follows: 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the first nine months of 2024 totaled 824.6 million, compared to 423.9 million for the first nine months of 2023. Net cash provided by operating activities for the first nine months of 2024 included net income of 553.5 million and non-cash adjustments to net income totaling 66.3 million, which primarily comprised depreciation and amortization of 137.6 million, stock-based compensation expense of 19.6 million, a loss on abandonment of assets of 17.8 million, amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs of 12.2 million, a loss recognized on the extinguishment of debt of 6.8 million, and pension settlement cost of 3.3 million, partially offset by a gain of 122.2 million, resulting from the divestiture of our WIS business, as described in Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures . 
 Other sources of cash in the first nine months of 2024 included an increase in accounts payable of 478.0 million primarily due the timing of inventory purchases and payment to suppliers, an increase in other current and noncurrent liabilities of 103.2 million, primarily due to increases in accrued interest payable, deferred revenue, federal income taxes payable and operating lease liabilities, and a decrease in other accounts receivable of 28.1 million. Additionally, an increase in other tax receivables and an increase in supplier price agreement receivables contributed to net operating cash flow. Primary uses of cash in the first nine months of 2024 included an increase in trade accounts receivable of 217.9 million due to the timing of receipts from customers, an increase in other current and noncurrent assets of 127.7 million primarily due to increases in capitalized costs associated with developing cloud computing arrangements, supplier prepayments and federal income taxes receivable, as well as an increase in inventories of 85.0 million. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the first nine months of 2023 totaled 423.9 million, which included net income of 623.6 million and non-cash adjustments to net income totaling 190.1 million, which primarily comprised depreciation and amortization of 136.4 million, stock-based compensation expense of 34.7 million and amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs of 11.1 million.

Table of Contents 
 WESCO INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Other sources of cash in the first nine months of 2023 included an increase in other current and noncurrent liabilities of 46.8 million and a decrease in other accounts receivable of 18.7 million due primarily to the collection of supplier volume rebates earned in 2022 in excess of income accrued during the first nine months of 2023, partially offset by an increase in value-added tax receivables. Primary uses of cash in the first nine months of 2023 included an increase in trade accounts receivable of 133.4 million due to the timing of receipts from customers, a decrease in accrued payroll and benefit costs of 120.9 million resulting primarily from management incentive compensation and a decrease in accounts payable of 86.5 million due to the timing of payments to suppliers. Net operating cash flow was also negatively impacted by an increase in inventories of 62.7 million. Inventories grew at a slower rate than sales, as supply chain lead times normalized. Uses of cash in the first nine months of 2023 also included an increase in other current and noncurrent assets of 51.8 million primarily due to an increase in capitalized costs associated with developing cloud computing arrangements. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash provided by investing activities for the first nine months of 2024 was 249.7 million compared to 61.2 million used in investing activities during the first nine months of 2023. Included in the first nine months of 2024 were 354.9 million in proceeds from the divestiture of the WIS business, net of cash transferred, partially offset by 41.7 million paid to acquire entroCIM and IES, net of cash acquired, as well as capital expenditures of 70.4 million compared to 63.6 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2023. Capital expenditures in the first nine months of 2024 primarily comprised internal-use computer software and information technology hardware to support our digital transformation initiatives, as well as equipment and leasehold improvements to support our global network of branches, warehouses and sales offices. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the first nine months of 2024 was 874.3 million, compared to 253.4 million during the first nine months of 2023. During the first nine months of 2024, financing activities primarily comprised the redemption of our 1,500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2025 Notes, proceeds of 900.0 million and 850.0 million related to the issuance of the 2029 Notes and 2032 Notes, respectively, net repayments of 468.0 million related to our Revolving Credit Facility, net repayments of 100.0 million related to our Receivables Facility, and payment of total debt issuance costs of 26.6 million related to the issuance of the 2029 and 2032 Notes and amendments to the Revolving Credit Facility and Receivables Facility. The first nine months of 2024 also included 375.0 million of common stock repurchases, 61.4 million and 43.1 million of dividends paid to holders of our common stock and Series A Preferred Stock, respectively, and 26.2 million of payments for taxes related to the exercise and vesting of stock-based awards. 
 During the first nine months of 2023, financing activities primarily comprised net borrowings of 15.0 million related to our Receivables Facility, net borrowings of 1.7 million related to our Revolving Credit Facility, and the repayment of our 58.6 million aggregate principal amount of 5.50 Anixter Senior Notes due 2023. The first nine months of 2023 also included 68.0 million of payments for taxes related to the exercise and vesting of stock-based awards, 57.6 million and 43.1 million of dividends paid to holders of our common stock and Series A Preferred Stock, respectively and 50.0 million of common stock repurchases. 
 Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments 
 There were no material changes in our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments that would require an update to the disclosure provided in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Seasonality 
 Our operating results are not significantly affected by seasonal factors. Sales during the first and fourth quarters have historically been affected by a reduced level of activity due to the impact of weather on projects. Sales typically increase beginning in March, with slight fluctuations per month through October. During periods of economic expansion or contraction, our sales by quarter have varied significantly from this pattern. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 There have been no significant changes to the critical accounting estimates disclosed in Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Recent Accounting Standards 
 See Note 2, Accounting Policies of our Notes to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards. 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 All statements made herein that are not historical facts should be considered as forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding business strategy, growth strategy, competitive strengths, productivity and profitability enhancement, competition, new product and service introductions, and liquidity and capital resources. Such statements can generally be identified by the use of words such as anticipate, plan, believe, estimate, intend, expect, project, and similar words, phrases or expressions or future or conditional verbs such as could, may, should, will, and would, although not all forward-looking statements contain such words. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and beliefs of Wesco's management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, Wesco's management, current market trends and market conditions and involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of Wesco's and Wesco's management's control, and which may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on such statements. 
 Important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those presented or implied in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of, and other risks associated with, acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures and other corporate transactions; the inability to successfully integrate acquired businesses; the impact of increased interest rates or borrowing costs; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; failure to adequately protect Wesco's intellectual property or successfully defend against infringement claims; the inability to successfully deploy new technologies, digital products and information systems or to otherwise adapt to emerging technologies in the marketplace, such as those incorporating artificial intelligence; failure to execute on our efforts and programs related to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters; unanticipated expenditures or other adverse developments related to compliance with new or stricter government policies, laws or regulations, including those relating to data privacy, sustainability and environmental protection; the inability to successfully develop, manage or implement new technology initiatives or business strategies, including with respect to the expansion of e-commerce capabilities and other digital solutions and digitalization initiatives; disruption of information technology systems or operations; natural disasters (including as a result of climate change), health epidemics, pandemics and other outbreaks; supply chain disruptions; geopolitical issues, including the impact of the evolving conflicts in the Middle East and Russia/Ukraine; the impact of sanctions imposed on, or other actions taken by the U.S. or other countries against, Russia or China; the failure to manage the increased risks and impacts of cyber incidents or data breaches; and exacerbation of key materials shortages, inflationary cost pressures, material cost increases, demand volatility, and logistics and capacity constraints, any of which may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. All such factors are difficult to predict and are beyond the Company's control. Additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those described above can be found in Wesco's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and other periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks. 
 For a discussion of changes to the market risks that were previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, refer to Part I, Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and to Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors . 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 As set forth in Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies to the Notes to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, from time to time, a number of lawsuits and claims have been or may be asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business, including litigation relating to commercial, product and employment matters (including wage and hour). The outcome of any litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and some lawsuits may be determined adversely to us. However, management does not believe that the ultimate outcome of any such pending matters is likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity, although the resolution in any fiscal period of one or more of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in Item 1A. to Part I of WESCO International, Inc. s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and Item 1A. to Part II of Wesco's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2024.

 (1) There were 1,116 shares purchased during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024 that were not part of the publicly announced share repurchase program. These shares were surrendered by stock-based compensation plan participants to satisfy tax withholding obligations arising from the exercise of stock-settled stock appreciation rights and vesting of restricted stock units. 
 (2) On June 1, 2022, Wesco announced that its Board of Directors authorized, on May 31, 2022, the repurchase of up to 1 billion of the Company s common stock and Series A Preferred Stock. The share repurchase authorization has no expiration date and may be modified, suspended, or terminated at any time without prior notice. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company entered into spot repurchase transactions through brokers to purchase 161,614 shares of its common stock in the open market for cash totaling 25.0 million. Wesco funded the repurchases with available cash and borrowings under its accounts receivable securitization and revolving credit facilities.
