Impairment of goodwill 

Balance as of September 30, 2024 

The Company conducts an annual impairment test
of goodwill at December 31 st or if events or circumstances exist that would indicate that the Company s goodwill may
be impaired. As circumstances changed during the three months ended June 30, 2024, that would, more likely than not, reduce the Company s
fair value below its net equity value, the Company performed qualitative and quantitative analyses of the potential impairment of its
goodwill, specifically evaluating trends in market capitalization, current and future cash flows, revenue growth rates, and the impact
of macroeconomic conditions on the Company and its performance. Based on the analysis performed, the Company determined that its goodwill
was fully impaired due to the continuation of revenues being below management s expectations, continued operating losses and negative
operating cash flows, reductions in the Company s stock price and market capitalization, and the delisting from Nasdaq and subsequent
transition to the OTCQX market in the second quarter of 2024 whereby the Company s common stock has been thinly traded. As a result,
the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge in the amount of million in June 2024.

Accrued expenses 

for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The effective tax rate differs from the federal tax rate of for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023 due primarily to the full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and other discrete items. 

At December 31, 2023, the Company had federal
and state net operating losses NOLs in the amount of approximately million and million. While the federal
NOLs carryforward indefinitely, the Tax Cuts Jobs Act of 2017 limits the amount of federal net operating loss utilized each year
after December 31, 2020 to of taxable income. The state NOLs begin to expire in 2031 . 

Income tax expense is recorded using the asset
and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to temporary
differences between amounts reported for income tax purposes and financial statement purposes, using current tax rates. A valuation allowance
is recognized if it is anticipated that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company must assess the likelihood
that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent that the Company believes that recovery is
not likely, it must establish a valuation allowance. Significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income
taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets. 

The Company and its subsidiaries income
tax returns since 2019 remain subject to examination by tax jurisdictions.

Revenues and Cost of Revenue 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, our total revenue was 7.0 million and 8.7 million, respectively, representing a decrease in revenue of 1.7 million. The decline
is primarily due to customer turnover. The market is evolving, and we are adapting our approach to better serve our customers needs.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, our total revenue was 21.6 million and 28.4 million, respectively, representing a decrease in revenue of 6.9 million. The
decline is primarily due to customer turnover. The market is evolving, and we are adapting our approach to better serve our customers 
needs. While we have seen some customer turnover, we are confident that our new initiatives will lead to long-term revenue growth. 

Total revenues consist of fees that we charge
our customers in consideration for administering their self-insured healthcare plans as well as fees that we receive for ancillary services
such as care management, case management, cost containment services, and other services provided to our customers by us or other vendors.

General and Administrative Expenses 

We incurred 2.8 million of general and administrative
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a
decrease of 2.2 million. The reason for the decrease is due to (i) the actions taken throughout 2023 and the first nine months of 2024
to aligning the two TPA companies into one amounting to approximately 2.2 million in savings and (ii) the elimination of non value-added
services amounting to approximately 640 thousand in savings. 

We incurred 10.0 million of general and administrative
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 15.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease
of 6.0 million. The reason for the decrease is due to (i) the actions taken throughout 2023 and the first nine months of 2024 to aligning
the two TPA companies into one amounting to approximately 4.7 million in savings and (ii) the elimination of non value-added services
amounting to approximately 1.4 million in savings. 

Sales and Marketing Expenses

expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a
decrease of 1.5 million. The reason for the decrease is due to the actions taken throughout 2023 and the first nine months of 2024 to
align the two TPA companies into one amounting to approximately 1.5 million in savings. 

We incurred 1.4 million of sales and marketing
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease
of 4.1 million. The reason for the decrease is due to the actions taken throughout 2023 and the first nine months of 2024 to align the
two TPA companies into one amounting to approximately 4.1 million in savings. 

Information Technology Expenses 

We incurred 1.3 million of information technology
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an
increase of 4 thousand. 

We incurred 3.6 million of information technology
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease
of 1.2 million. The reason for the decrease is due to the actions taken throughout 2023 and the first nine months of 2024 to align the
two TPA companies into one amounting to approximately 1.2 million in savings. 

Research and Development Expenses 

We incurred 7 thousand of research and development
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 267 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease
of 260 thousand. The decrease is attributable to focusing our efforts and eliminating certain development projects amounting to approximately
 260 thousand. 

We incurred 22 thousand of research and development
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease
of 1.3 million. The decrease is attributable to focusing our efforts and eliminating certain development projects amounting to approximately
 1.3 million. 

Depreciation and Amortization 

We incurred 213 thousand of depreciation and
amortization expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 927 thousand for the three months ended September 30,
2023, a decrease of 714 thousand. This decrease was primarily due to the impairment of intangibles in September of 2024 of 273 thousand
and a reduction due to software amortization by approximately 434 thousand. 

We incurred 2.1 million of depreciation and amortization
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease
of 896 thousand. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction by approximately 203 thousand in the depreciation of assets that were
disposed of during the prior year, the impairment of intangibles in September of 2024 of 273 thousand and software becoming fully amortized
in 2024 amounting to approximately 470 thousand, partially offset by the new patents placed into service during 2024 amounting to approximately
 65 thousand. 

21 

Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets 

The Company conducts an annual impairment test
of goodwill and intangible assets at December 31 st or if events or circumstances exist that would indicate that the Company s
goodwill may be impaired. As circumstances changed during the three months ended June 30, 2024, that would, more likely than not, reduce
the Company s fair value below its net equity value, the Company performed qualitative and quantitative analyses of the potential
impairment of its goodwill and intangible assets, specifically evaluating trends in market capitalization, current and future cash flows,
revenue growth rates, and the impact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company and its performance. Based on the analysis performed,
the Company determined that its goodwill and intangible assets were fully impaired in June 2024 due to the continuation of revenues being
below management s expectations, continued operating losses and negative operating cash flows, reductions in the Company s
stock price and market capitalization, and the delisting from the Nasdaq and subsequent transition to the OTCQX market in the second quarter
of 2024 where the Company s common stock has been thinly traded. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill and intangible asset
impairment charge in the amount of 7.6 million in June 2024, which is reflected in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Interest Expense, net 

We incurred 620 thousand of interest expense
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 383 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of
 237 thousand. Interest expense increased primarily due to the debt to Libertas Funding LLC Libertas and JGB Collateral
LLC JGB which was partially offset by the decrease in interest due to AXA S.A., a French soci t anonyme AXA for the acquisition of Maestro being partially paid down in 2023. 

We incurred 1.9 million of interest expense for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 788
thousand. Interest expense increased primarily due to the debt to and JGB which was partially offset by the decrease in interest due to
AXA for the acquisition of Maestro being partially paid down in 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated
deficit of approximately 97.7 million, unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of approximately 830 thousand and negative working capital
of approximately 3.3 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a net loss of approximately 20.9 million and
negative cash flows from operations of approximately 10.3 million. 

We have spent most of our cash resources on funding
our operating activities. Through September 30, 2024, we have financed our operations primarily with the proceeds from loans, the issuance
of convertible promissory notes and warrants, and sales of our equity securities. 

On January 16, 2024, we entered into a securities
purchase agreement (the Second SPA with certain Company insiders consisting of HillCour Investment Fund, LLC HillCour ),
an entity controlled by our Chief Executive Officer, our Chairman, and one of our directors, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and
sell 1,322,100 shares of Common Stock in a private placement, at a purchase price of 0.9201 per share (or the consolidated closing bid
price of our Common Stock on Nasdaq as of January 16, 2024). 

On April 15, 2024, we entered into a Securities
Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement with each of the purchasers that are parties thereto (each, including its successors
and assigns, a Purchaser and collectively, the Purchasers and JGB. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase
Agreement, on April 15, 2024, the Company issued the Senior Secured Convertible Debentures (the Debentures due on April
15, 2027, for a principal sum of 11.83 million, subject to the redemption of 5 million at the Company s election. In accordance
with the Purchase Agreement JGB purchased an aggregate of 6.35 million in principal amount of the Debentures. On June 21, 2024, the Company
elected not to redeem an additional 5 million of the Debentures with JGB. 

On August 28, 2024, we entered into a securities
purchase agreement with two investors, including HillCour, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell an aggregate of 2,702,702 shares
of its Common Stock (of which HillCour purchased 1,351,351 shares of Common Stock) in a private placement, at a purchase price of 0.481
per share (or the closing bid price of the Company s Common Stock on OTCQX as of August 28, 2024). 

Management continues to evaluate additional funding
alternatives and is seeking to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities. 

If we are unable to raise additional capital moving
forward, our ability to operate in the normal course and continue to invest in our product portfolio may be materially and adversely impacted
and we may be forced to scale back operations or divest some or all of our assets. 

As a result of the above, in connection with our
assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined
that our liquidity condition raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern through twelve months from the
date these condensed consolidated financial statements are available to be issued. The condensed consolidated financial statements do
not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary
should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our condensed consolidated financial statements
are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to
make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the applicable periods.
We evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis. Our estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on historical
experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different assumptions and judgments would
change the estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements, which, in turn, could change the results
from those reported. 

See Note 4 to our condensed consolidated financial
statements included in this Form 10-Q for a description of the significant accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated
financial statements. 

New Accounting Pronouncements 

We have considered recently issued accounting
pronouncements and do not believe the adoption of such pronouncements will have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial
statements.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Foreign exchange risk 

The cash generated from revenue is denominated
in U.S. Dollars. Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our operations, which
are in the United States and Israel. Our results of current and future operations and cash flows are therefore subject to fluctuations
due to changes in the exchange rate of the New Israeli Shekel (NIS). The effect of a hypothetical 10 change in the exchange rate of the
NIS versus the U.S. Dollar would not have had a material impact on our historical condensed consolidated financial statements for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024. To date we have not entered into derivative or hedging transactions, but we may do so in the future
if our exposure to foreign currency becomes or is expected to become more significant. 

Interest rate risk 

We had cash and cash equivalents balances of 830
thousand and 1.1 million on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Currently, management does not view this exposure
to be a significant risk. 

Inflation Risk 

Inflation generally affects us by increasing our
labor costs. We do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations during
the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial and Accounting Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the
end of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial and Accounting
Officer have concluded that, during the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Disclosure controls and procedures are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer or persons performing similar functions,
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the third quarter ended September
30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 

In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls
and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable
assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the
fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls
and procedures relative to their costs.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

In addition to the other information set forth
in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed below and in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023
Annual Report, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. 

Currently, our
revenues are concentrated with one major customer and our revenues may decrease significantly if we were to lose our major customer. 

Due to our limited operating history, we have
a limited customer base and have depended on a major customer for a significant portion of our revenue. For the three month periods ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had one customer that accounted for 14.6 and 11.3 of total revenue, respectively. For the nine month
periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had one customer that had 15.4 and 10.9 of total revenue, respectively. At September 30,
2024, two customers accounted for 51.4 , and 11.3 of accounts receivable. At December 31, 2023, two customers accounted for 16.6 and
14.0 of accounts receivable. 

If our major customers were to terminate their
agreement with us, or if we fail to adequately perform under our agreement, and if we are unable to diversify our customer base, our revenue
could decline, and our results of operations could be adversely affected. 

We are reviewing strategic alternatives
and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying or completing any strategic transaction, that any such strategic
transaction will result in additional value for our stockholders or that the process will not have an adverse impact on our business. 

The process of reviewing strategic alternatives
may be costly, time consuming and disruptive to our business operations and, if we are unable to effectively manage the process, our business,
financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We may incur significant costs associated with identifying,
evaluating and negotiating potential strategic alternatives, such as legal, financial advisor and accounting fees and expenses and other
related charges. We may also incur additional unanticipated expenses in connection with this process. A considerable portion of these
costs will be incurred regardless of whether any such course of action is implemented or transaction is completed, decreasing cash available
for use in our business. 

There can be no assurance that any potential transaction,
or series of transactions, or other strategic alternative, if found and if consummated, will provide greater value to our stockholders
than that reflected in the current price of our common stock. Until the review process is concluded, perceived uncertainties related to
our future may impact our business performance and volatility in the market price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for
us to attract and retain qualified personnel and key employees. Our Board has not set a timetable for the conclusion of this review, nor
has it made any definitive decisions related to taking any further actions or potential strategic options at this time or at all.
