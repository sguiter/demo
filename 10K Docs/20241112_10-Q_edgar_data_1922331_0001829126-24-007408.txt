CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q Report ), including Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, regarding future events and the future results of the Company that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the industry in which the Company operates and the beliefs and assumptions of the management of the Company. Words such as expects, anticipates, targets, goals, projects, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. These factors include but are not limited to the Summary Risk Factors and Risk Factors described herein. 

You should read the matters described and incorporated by reference in Summary Risk Factors and Risk Factors and the other cautionary statements made in this Report, and incorporated by reference herein, as being applicable to all related forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this Report. We cannot assure you that the forward-looking statements in this Report will prove to be accurate and therefore prospective investors are encouraged not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. 

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Report or the date of any document incorporated by reference in this Report, as applicable. Except to the extent required by applicable law or regulation, we do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 

Summary Risk Factors 

We face risks and uncertainties related to our business, many of which are beyond our control. In particular, risks associated with our business include: 

our ability to realize anticipated benefits of the business combination, and unanticipated expenses or delays in connection with the business combination; 

if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, our initial stockholders and members of our management team have agreed to vote in favor of such initial business combination, regardless of how our public stockholders vote; 

past performance by our sponsor and our management team including their affiliates and including the businesses referred to herein, may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us or in the future performance of any business that we may acquire. 

our management may not be able to maintain control of a target business after our initial business combination. Upon the loss of control of a target business, new management may not possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to profitably operate such business. 

we may not be able to complete our initial business combination in the prescribed time frame; 

your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination may be limited to the exercise of your right to redeem your shares from us for cash; 

we may not be successful in retaining or recruiting required officers, key employees or directors following our initial business combination; 

ii 

our officers and directors may have difficulties allocating their time between our Company and other businesses and may potentially have conflicts of interest with our business or in approving our initial business combination. We are dependent upon our executive officers and directors and their loss could adversely affect our ability to operate; 

we may not be able to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination or reduce the number of shareholders requesting redemption. The ability of our public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure; 

we may issue our shares to investors in connection with our initial business combination at a price that is less than the prevailing market price of our shares at that time; 

Our sponsor paid an aggregate of 25,000, or approximately 0.009 per founder share, and, accordingly, you will experience immediate and substantial dilution from the purchase of the shares of our Class A common stock; 

Since our sponsor paid only approximately 0.009 per share for the founder shares, our officers and directors could potentially make a substantial profit even if we acquire a target business that subsequently declines in value; 

you may not be given the opportunity to choose the initial business target or to vote on the initial business combination. 

Subsequent to the completion of our initial business combination, we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our share price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment; 

trust account funds may not be protected against third party claims or bankruptcy; 

an active market for our public securities may not develop and you will have limited liquidity and trading; 

the availability to us of funds from interest income on the trust account balance may be insufficient to operate our business prior to the business combination; and 

our financial performance following a business combination with an entity may be negatively affected by their lack an established record of revenue, cash flows and experienced management. 

Changes in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination and results of operations. 

Other risk factors included under Risk Factors in our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K and set forth below under Risk Factors .

On October 4, 2022, the Company closed on the over-allotment through the sale of Units at a purchase of 10.00 per share for gross proceeds of approximately million. 

Simultaneously with the consummation of the closing of the Offering, the Company consummated the private placement of an aggregate of units (the Private Placement Units to Global Star Acquisition 1 LLC, the sponsor of the Company (the Sponsor ), at a price of per Private Placement Unit, generating total gross proceeds of (the Private Placement (see Note 4). 

On October 4, 2022, the Company consummated the closing of the sale of additional units at a price of per unit upon receiving notice of the underwriters election to exercise their overallotment option generating additional gross proceeds of million. Simultaneously with the exercise of the overallotment, the Company consummated the Private Placement of an additional Private Placement Units to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of . 

Transaction costs amounted to consisting of of underwriting fees (net of underwriter reimbursements), of deferred underwriting fees payable, which are held in a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company acting as trustee (the Trust Account and of other offering costs related to the Initial Public Offering. The underwriters were also issued shares of Class A common stock as representative shares, in connection with the IPO. Upon close of the Initial Public Offering, the Company recorded additional issuance costs of , the grant date fair value of the shares, with an offset to additional paid-in capital. As described in Note 6, the deferred underwriting fees are contingent upon the consummation of the Business Combination within months from the closing of the IPO pursuant to six one-month extensions, from June 22, 2023 until December 22, 2024, provided that the Sponsor (or its affiliates or permitted designees) will deposit into the Trust Account for each such one-month extension until December 22, 2024, unless the closing of the Company s initial business combination shall have occurred. (See Special Meetings section below). 

Nasdaq rules provide that at least of the gross proceeds from the IPO and the sale of the placement units be deposited in a trust account. Of the net proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the placement units, , per unit, was placed into a trust account (the Trust Account established for the benefit of the holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the public stockholders ), with Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company acting as trustee and Morgan Stanley Wealth Management acting as investment manager. These proceeds include in deferred underwriting commissions. 

The proceeds in the trust account may be invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ), with a maturity of days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account to the Company s stockholders, as described below. 

On August 19, 2024, the Company received a letter (the MVLS Deficiency Notice from the listing qualifications department staff (the Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market Nasdaq notifying the Company that from July 5, 2024 to August 14, 2024, the Company s Market Value of Listed Securities MVLS was below the minimum of million required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(A) (the MVLS Requirement ). 

The MVLS Deficiency Notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company s common stock, and the Company s common stock continues to trade on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol GLST. 

In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(C), the Company has 180 calendar days from the date of the MVLS Deficiency Notice, or until February 17, 2025 (the Compliance Date ), to regain compliance with respect to the MVLS Requirement. The MVLS Deficiency Notice states that to regain compliance with the MVLS Requirement, the Company s MVLS must close at million or more for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during the compliance period ending on the Compliance Date. 

If the Company does not regain compliance by the Compliance Date, Nasdaq will provide written notice to the Company that its securities are subject to delisting. At that time, the Company may appeal any such delisting determination. However, there can be no assurance that, if the Company receives a delisting notice from the Staff and appeals the delisting determination, such appeal would be successful. Alternatively, the Company may consider applying for transfer to The Nasdaq Capital Market (the Capital Market ). 

Special Meetings 

On August 22, 2023, the Company held a Special Meeting of Stockholders (the August 2023 Meeting ). At the Meeting, the Company s stockholders approved the Charter Amendment, which extends the date by which the Company must consummate its initial business combination by an additional nine-months pursuant to nine one-month extensions, from September 22, 2023 to June 22, 2024 (the First New Termination Date ), subject to the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company (the Board ), provided the sponsor or its designees deposit into the trust account a monthly amount equal to , prior to the commencement of each extension period (the Extension ). The Company filed the Charter Amendment with the Office of the Secretary of State of Delaware on August 28, 2023, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 3.1 in the Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 28, 2023 and is incorporated by reference herein. At the Meeting, Stockholders holding shares of common stock exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at an approximate price of per share of the funds in the Trust Account. As a result, for the period ended September 30, 2024, an aggregate of was withdrawn from the Trust Account to pay such holders. Following the redemption, the Company s remaining shares of Class A common stock outstanding were . The Company has made nine monthly payments of in the Trust Account to extend the period of time it has to consummate its initial business combination to January 22, 2024 (see Note 11). The Company will provide its holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. In connection with a proposed Business Combination, the Company may seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against a Business Combination. The Company will proceed with a Business Combination only if the Company has net tangible assets of at least either immediately prior to or upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. 

The Company has until November 22, 2024 (or up to December 22, 2024, in the event the Company extends the term to the fullest), to consummate a Business Combination. If we do not complete our initial business combination by December 22, 2024, or (i) as extended by the Company s stockholders in accordance with our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity and (iii) waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares and placement shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination prior to the Second New Termination date, the public stockholders will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the Second New Termination Date unless our initial business combination shall have occurred earlier and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our public stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date. 

Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than the independent public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that any such executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against such third party, the Sponsor shall not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Sponsor shall have the right to defend against any such claim with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the Company if, within 15 days following written receipt of notice of the claim to the Sponsor, the Sponsor notifies the Company in writing that it shall undertake such defense. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. 

Franchise and Income Tax Withdrawals from Trust Account 

Since completion of its IPO on
September 22, 2022, and through September 30, 2024, the Company withdrew 
from the Trust Account to pay its liabilities related to income and Delaware franchise taxes. Through September 30, 2024, the
Company remitted 
to the respective tax authorities, with the difference of 
to be remitted as Company s tax obligations become due. Inadvertently the Company used of those funds to pay for
working capital purposes and as such breached the Company s charter. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company received
additional funds from the Sponsor under the terms of promissory note. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had accrued but unpaid
income tax liability of 
and accrued but unpaid Delaware franchise tax liability of .
The Company remitted 
in payment of its income tax liability for 2023 (including interest and penalties) on July 3, 2024, and intends to settle its
obligations for income and Delaware Franchise taxes as they become due. 

Liquidity and Going Concern 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of in its operating bank accounts, which is restricted for payment of the Company s tax obligations (as described above). The Company had of marketable securities held in the Trust Account to be used for an initial Business Combination or to repurchase or redeem stock in connection therewith and working capital deficit of . From the date of the IPO and through September 30, 2024, the Company has withdrawn an aggregate of for payment of its income and franchise taxes. 

The Company may raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from the Sponsor or its shareholders, officers, directors, or third parties. The Company s officers and directors, the Sponsor or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to loan us funds, from time to time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company s working capital needs. Based on the foregoing, the Company believes it will not have sufficient cash to meet its needs through the earlier of consummation of a Business Combination or December 22, 2024. 

However, if the Company s estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a Business Combination are more than the actual amount necessary to do so, or if the Company s shareholders approve an extension to the mandatory liquidation date beyond 21 months from the closing of the IPO, the Company may have insufficient funds available to operate its business prior to a Business Combination. Moreover, the Company may need to obtain additional financing either to complete a Business Combination or because it becomes obligated to redeem a significant number of its Public Shares upon completion of a Business Combination, in which case the Company may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, the Company would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of a Business Combination. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination because it does not have sufficient funds available, it will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account. In addition, following our Business Combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, the Company may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet its obligations. 

If the Company does not consummate a Business Combination by December 22, 2024, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board s FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern, the Company has determined that the liquidity condition due to insufficient working capital and mandatory liquidation, should a Business Combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after 12 months from the closing of the Public Offering. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustment that might be necessary, if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 

On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IR Act was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new U.S. federal excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations and certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax.

In connection with our initial business combination, we may enter into a stockholder agreement or other arrangements with the stockholders of the target or other investors to provide for voting or other corporate governance arrangements that differ from those in effect upon completion of our IPO. 

The shares of Class B common stock will automatically convert into Class A common stock at the time of a Business Combination, or earlier at the option of the holder, on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment. In the case that additional shares of Class A common stock, or equity-linked securities, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts issued in the Initial Public Offering and related to the closing of a Business Combination, the ratio at which shares of Class B common stock shall convert into shares of Class A common stock will be adjusted (unless the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Class B common stock agree to waive such adjustment with respect to any such issuance or deemed issuance) so that the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of all shares of Class B common stock will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, of the sum of the total number of all shares of common stock outstanding upon the completion of Initial Public Offering plus all shares of Class A common stock and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with a Business Combination (net of the number of shares of Class A common stock redeemed in connection with a Business Combination), excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued or issuable to any seller of an interest in the target to us in a Business Combination.

Warrants As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there are Public Warrants outstanding. Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole warrants will trade. The Public Warrants will become exercisable on the later of (a) days after the completion of a Business Combination and (b) months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering. The Public Warrants will expire five years after the completion of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. 

The Company will not be obligated to deliver any shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is then effective and a current prospectus relating to those shares of Class A common stock is available, subject to the Company satisfying its obligations with respect to registration, or a valid exemption from registration is available. warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and the Company will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of residence of the exercising holder, or an exemption from registration is available. 

The Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than business days after the closing of a Business Combination, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to file, and within business days following a Business Combination to have declared effective, a registration statement covering the issuance of the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those shares of Class A common stock until the warrants expire or are redeemed. Notwithstanding the above, if the Class A common stock is at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that it satisfies the definition of a covered security under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, the Company may, at its option, require holders of Public Warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event the Company so elects, the Company will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but will use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. 

Once the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding Public Warrants: 

in whole and not in part; 

at a price of 0.01 per Public Warrant; 

upon a minimum of days prior written notice of redemption, or the 30-day redemption period to each warrant holder; and 

if, and only if, the last reported sale price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganization, recapitalizations and the like) for any trading days within a -trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to warrant holders. 

If and when the warrants become redeemable by the Company, the Company may exercise its redemption right even if it is unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. 

If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, as described above, its management will have the option to require any holder that wishes to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a cashless basis, as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, extraordinary dividend or recapitalization, reorganization, merger, or consolidation. However, except as described below, the Public Warrants will not be adjusted for issuances of common stock at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the Public Warrants. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of Public Warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their Public Warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company s assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such Public Warrants. Accordingly, the Public Warrants may expire worthless. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there are Private Placement Warrants outstanding. The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants underlying the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering. The Company accounts for the warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC815-40. Such guidance provides that the warrants are not precluded from equity classification. Equity-classified contracts are initially measured at fair value (or allocated value). Subsequent changes in fair value are not recognized as long as the contracts continue to be classified in equity. 

The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants underlying the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering, except that the Private Placement Warrants (including the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants) will not be transferable, assignable or salable until days after the completion of a Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. Additionally, the Private Placement Warrants held by Stifel Venture will not be exercisable more than five years from the commencement of sales of the Initial Public Offering in accordance with FINRA Rule 5110(g)(8)(A). 

Rights Except in cases where the Company is not the surviving company in a business combination, each holder of a right will automatically receive one-tenth of one share of Class A common stock upon consummation of the initial business combination. The Company will not issue fractional shares in connection with an exchange of rights. Fractional shares will either be rounded down to the nearest whole share or otherwise addressed in accordance with the applicable provisions of United States law.

The Company follows the guidance in ASC 820 for its financial assets and liabilities that arere-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period, and non-financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at least annually. The fair value of the Company s financial assets and liabilities reflects management s estimate of amounts that the Company would have received in connection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from independent sources) and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities).

Results of Operations 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from July 24, 2019 (inception) through September 30, 2024, relates to organizational activities and identifying a target company for a business combination. We will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial Business Combination, at the earliest. We will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents from the proceeds derived from the IPO. The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end. We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our Business Combination. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete our Business Combination will be successful. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had net loss of 107,629, which consists of operating costs of 248,771, which primarily consist of legal, professional and advisory fees as well as insurance expense, and a provision for income taxes of 28,906 offset by interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 165,372 and interest income bank of 4,676.

Franchise and Income Tax Withdrawals from Trust Account 

Since completion of its IPO on September 22, 2022,
and through September 30, 2024, the Company withdrew 1,684,187 from the Trust Account to pay its liabilities related to income and Delaware
franchise taxes. Through September 30, 2024, the Company remitted 1,288,941 to the respective tax authorities, with the difference of
 395,247 to be remitted as Company s tax obligations become due. Inadvertently the Company used 3,108 of those funds to pay for
working capital purposes and as such breached the Company s charter. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company received additional
funds from the Sponsor under the terms of promissory note. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had accrued but unpaid income tax liability
of 288,597 and accrued but unpaid Delaware franchise tax liability of 169,113. The Company remitted 830,000 in payment of its income
tax liability for 2023 (including interest and penalties) on July 3, 2024, and intends to settle its obligations for income and Delaware
Franchise taxes as they become due. 

Liquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern 

On September 22, 2022, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 8,000,000 Units at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 80,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of our Initial Public Offering, we consummated the private placement of an aggregate of 456,225 Private Placement Units to our Sponsor at a price of 10.00 per Private Placement Unit, generating total gross proceeds of 4,562,250. On October 4, 2022, we closed on the over-allotment through the sale of 1,200,000 Units at a purchase of 10.00 per share for gross proceeds of approximately 12.0 million, and simultaneously with the exercise of the overallotment, we consummated the Private Placement of an additional 42,000 Private Placement Units to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of 420,000. A total of 96,982,250 was generated from our IPO.

Transaction costs amounted to 4,788,510 consisting of 920,000 of underwriting fees (net of underwriter reimbursements), 3,220,000 of deferred underwriting fees payable, which are held in a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company acting as trustee (the Trust Account and 648,510 of other offering costs related to the Initial Public Offering. The underwriters were also issued 115,000 shares of Class A common stock as representative shares, in connection with the IPO. Upon close of the Initial Public Offering, the Company recorded additional issuance costs of 79,338, the grant date fair value of the shares, with an offset to additional paid-in capital. As described in Note 6 Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to the Condensed consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report, the 3,220,000 deferred underwriting fees are contingent upon the consummation of the Business Combination within 12 months (or up to 27 months from the closing of the IPO at the election of the company in fifteen one-month extensions) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had 392,139 of cash on our balance sheet, which is restricted for payment of Company s taxes and a working capital deficit of 4,749,664. We intend to use the funds held outside of the Trust Account for identifying and evaluating prospective acquisition candidates, performing business due diligence on prospective target businesses, traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses, reviewing corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, selecting the target business to acquire and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination. The interest income earned on the investments in the Trust Account are unavailable to fund operating expenses. 

As previously disclosed on July 31, 2023, in a Form 8-K filed with the SEC, we issued a promissory note (the July 2023 Note in the principal amount of 1,600,000 to our Sponsor. The Note was issued in connection with a 1,600,000 loan the Sponsor has made to us for working capital expenses. If we complete the Business Combination, we would repay the Note out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to us. Otherwise, the Note would be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay the Note but no proceeds from the Trust Account would be used to repay the Note. At the election of the Sponsor, up to 1,500,000 of the unpaid principal amount of the Note may be converted into units of the Company at a price of 10.00 per unit (the Conversion Units in lieu of cash repayment. The principal balance of the Note is payable by us on the later of: (i) December 31, 2023, or (ii) the date on which we consummate a Business Combination. No interest shall accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the Note. 1,586,000 was drawn and outstanding under the Note as of September 30, 2024. 

On
April 15, 2024, the Company issued a promissory note to the Sponsor in an amount of up to 1,000,000 for working capital needs.
The note bears no interest and shall be payable by the Maker on the earlier of: (i) December 31, 2024 or (ii) the date on which
Maker consummates an initial public offering of its securities. The principal balance may be prepaid at any time. As of September
30, 2024 821,000 was drawn and outstanding under the promissory note. 

On October 23, 2024, the Company amended the terms of the promissory note to allow conversion of up to 1,000,000 into Class B Common Stock of the Company at a price of 10.00 per unit in lieu of cash repayment, effective immediately prior to the Business Combination. 

The issuance of the Note was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 

If the Company has not completed a Business Combination within 12 months from the closing of this offering (or up to 27 months from the closing of this offering in accordance with our amended and restated certificate of incorporation), the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to pay taxes (less up to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining stockholders and the Company s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Company s warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period.

Special Meetings, Extension and Trust Withdrawal from Trust Account 

On August 22, 2023, we held a Special Meeting of Stockholders (the August 2023 Meeting ). At the Meeting, our stockholders approved the Charter Amendment, which extends the date by which the Company must consummate its initial business combination by an additional nine-months pursuant to nine one-month extensions, from September 22, 2023 to June 22, 2024 (the First New Termination Date ), subject to the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company (the Board ), provided the sponsor or its designees deposit into the trust account a monthly amount equal to 125,000, prior to the commencement of each extension period (the Extension ). We filed the Charter Amendment with the Office of the Secretary of State of Delaware on August 28, 2023, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 3.1 in the Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 28, 2023 and is incorporated by reference herein. At the Meeting, Stockholders holding 4,052,066 shares of common stock exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at an approximate price of 10.53 per share of the funds in the Trust Account. As a result, for the period ended September 30, 2024, an aggregate of 44,605,448 was withdrawn from the Trust Account to pay such holders. Following the redemption, our remaining shares of Class A common stock outstanding were 5,147,934. 

On June 11, 2024, we held a Special Meeting of Stockholders (the June 2024 Meeting ). At the Meeting, our stockholders approved the Charter Amendment, which further extends the date by which the Company must consummate its initial business combination by an additional six-months pursuant to six one-month extensions, from June 22, 2024 to December 22, 2024 (the Second New Termination Date ), provided that the sponsor or its designees deposit into the trust account approximately 22,740 prior to the commencement of each extension period. At the June 2024 Meeting, Stockholders holding 4,010,928 shares of common stock exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at an approximate price of 11.12 per share of the funds in the Trust Account. As a result, 44,605,448 was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders. We have made two monthly extension payments in the Trust Account to extend the period of time by which it has to consummate its initial business combination to August 22, 2024. 

We had until August 22, 2024 (or up to December 22, 2024, in the event we extend the term to the fullest), to consummate a Business Combination. If we do not complete our initial business combination by December 22, 2024, or (i) as extended by our stockholders in accordance with our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity and (iii) waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares and placement shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination prior to the Second New Termination date, the public stockholders will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the Second New Termination Date unless our initial business combination shall have occurred earlier and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our public stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 392,139 in our operating bank accounts, 12,919,725 of marketable securities held in the Trust Account to be used for an initial Business Combination or to repurchase or redeem stock in connection therewith and a working capital deficit of 4,749,664. As of September 30, 2024, 49,454 of the amount on deposit in the Trust Account represented interest income that is available to pay our tax obligations, net of amounts previously withdrawn. 

We may raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from the Sponsor or our stockholders, officers, directors, or third parties. Our officers and directors, the Sponsor or their affiliates may but are not obligated to loan us funds, from time to time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet our working capital needs. Based on the foregoing, we do not believe we will have sufficient cash to meet our needs through the earlier of consummation of a Business Combination or June 22, 2024, or such earlier date as determine by our board of directors, the deadline to complete a Business Combination pursuant to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (unless otherwise amended by stockholders). 

34 

Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements 

We have no obligations, assets, or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. 

Contractual Obligations 

We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to pay the Sponsor a monthly fee up to 10,000 for office space, utilities, and secretarial and administrative support services. We began incurring these fees on September 22, 2022 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of the Business Combination and our liquidation. 

The underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of 3,220,000 in the aggregate. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. 

In order to finance transaction costs in connection with the Business Combination, our Sponsor extended to us a line of credit of up to 1,600,000 pursuant to a Promissory Note dated July 31, 2023 Sponsor Working Capital Loan ). Such Sponsor Working Capital Loan is without interest and is to be repaid on the later of (i) December 31, 2023 or (ii) upon the consummation of a Business Combination. The Sponsor in its sole discretion may elect to convert up to 1,500,000 amount of the Sponsor Working Capital Loan into the Company s Common Stock at a price of 10.00 per share in lieu of cash repayment. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Sponsor Working Capital Loan, but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Sponsor Working Capital Loans. 

Agreements with Service Providers 

From time to time the Company has entered into and may enter into agreements with various services providers and advisors, including investment banks, to help us identify targets, negotiate terms of potential Business Combinations, consummate a Business Combination and/or provide other services. In connection with these agreements, the Company may be required to pay such service providers and advisors fees in connection with their services to the extent that certain conditions, including the closing of a potential Business Combination, are met. If a Business Combination does not occur, the Company would not expect to be required to pay these contingent fees. There can be no assurance that the Company will complete a Business Combination. 

On September 24, 2023, the Company has engaged EF Hutton, division of Benchmark Investments, LLC EF Hutton to act as the exclusive placement agent Placement Agent for the Company, in connection with the proposed offering by private placement of equity or equity-linked securities in the form of a PIPE, forward purchase arrangement or similar type of equity line financing (the Placement to qualified institutional buyers as such term is defined in Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act and to the institutional accredited investors as such term is defined in Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act of the Company s equity or equity-linked securities, including warrants, options or other rights to purchase such securities (collectively, the Securities ). In case of successful Placements, a non-refundable cash placement fee (the Placement Fee ), payable at each closing of a Placement, in an amount equal to seven percent (7.0 ), as well as foreign placement fee of 1 , and reduced placement fee of 1 of the aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of all Securities in the Placement would be due and payable to EF Hutton. 

On November 27, 2023, the Company engaged MZHCI, LLC, a MZ Group Company MZHCI as its public relations consultant starting from January 1, 2024 (the MZHCI Agreement ). According to terms of the MZHCI Agreement, MZHCI will be paid a monthly fee of 10,000 for its services for the period of the Proposed Business Combination starting from January 1, 2023, which will increase to 14,000 (subject to 5 cost of living adjustment) upon closing of the Proposed Business Combination. In addition, upon a successful closing of the Proposed Business Combination, the Company will issue to MZHCI 150,000 worth of the Company s restricted stock as valued on the first day of trading post-closing.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

We prepare our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted principles, which require management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting periods. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations would be affected. We base our estimates on our own historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable taking into account our circumstances and future expectations based on the available information. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. 

We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if (i) the accounting estimate requires to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time when the accounting estimate was made; and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material amount on our financial condition or results of operations. There are items in our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed to be critical, as defined above. 

For a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies and related judgements, see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation in the Notes to the Condensed consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. 

Warrant Classification 

The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants underlying the Units sold in the IPO. Company account for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480 and ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to our of common stock, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance. The fair value of the warrants are remeasured at each balance sheet date with the change in the estimated fair value of the warrants recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. We have analyzed the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants and determined they are considered to be freestanding instruments and do not exhibit any of the characteristics in ASC 480 and therefore are not classified as liabilities under ASC 480. 

Class A Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption 

We account for our Class A common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Shares of Class A common stock subject to mandatory redemption are classified as a liability instrument and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable shares of Class A common stock (including Class A common stock that features redemption rights that is either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, shares of Class A common stock are classified as stockholders equity. Our Class A common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, Class A common stock subject to possible redemption is presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders deficit section of our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

36 

Share-Based Payment Arrangements 

We measure and recognize compensation expense for all share-based payments on their estimated fair values measured as of the grant date. These costs are recognized as an expense in the statements of operations upon vesting, once the applicable performance conditions are met, with an offsetting increase to additional paid-in capital. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur. 

Net (Loss) Income per Common Share 

Net (loss) income per common share of common stock is computed by dividing net (loss) income by the weighted average number of common shares issued and outstanding during the period. Subsequent measurement of the redeemable shares of Class A common stock is excluded from (loss) income per ordinary share as the redemption value approximates fair value. We calculate our earnings per share to allocate net (loss) income pro rata to shares of Class A and Class B common stock. This presentation contemplates a Business Combination as the most likely outcome, in which case, both classes of common stock share pro rata in the (loss) income of our Company. 

Income Taxes 

We account for income taxes under ASC 740, Income Taxes. ASC 740, Income Taxes, requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the condensed consolidated financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and tax credit carry forwards. ASC 740 additionally requires a valuation allowance to be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. We also recognized accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. We have identified the United States as our only major tax jurisdiction. We are subject to income taxation by major taxing authorities since inception. These examinations may include questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with federal and state tax laws. We do not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months. 

Recent Accounting Standards 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09), which requires disclosure of incremental income tax information within the rate reconciliation and expanded disclosures of income taxes paid, among other disclosure requirements. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company s management does not believe the adoption of ASU 2023-09 will have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 

Item 3. 
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Through September 30, 2024, we were not subject to any market or interest rate risk. The net proceeds held in the Trust Account have been invested in U.S. government treasury bills, notes or bonds with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in certain money market funds that invest solely in U.S. treasuries. Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe there will be no associated material exposure to interest rate risk.

Item 4. 
 Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer (together, the Certifying Officers ), we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. The Company is experiencing difficulty in the accounting and reporting related to the existence of assets and corresponding income, as well as the accounting and reporting for the completeness and accuracy of our liabilities and the corresponding income and expenses, which it experienced and reported as a material weakness in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, this material weakness in the disclosure controls and procedures over financial reporting has not been fully remediated. Additionally, we have established that we did not maintain adequate internal controls over compliance with the investment management trust agreement as it relates to permitted withdrawals from the Trust Account. 

In light of the material weakness, we have made control improvements, including enhancing the efficacy of our review processes to identify and appropriately apply applicable accounting requirements to better evaluate and understand the nuances of the accounting standards that apply to the treatment and reporting of related party transactions. in our financial statements. Our plans at this time also include providing enhanced access to accounting literature, research materials and documents and increased communication among our management and third-party professionals with whom we consult regarding related party accounting applications. Furthermore, in light of this material weakness, we performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this Report present fairly in all material respects our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. We continue to evaluate steps to remediate the identified material weakness. These remediation measures may be time consuming and costly and there is no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. 

We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Other than as described above, during the most recently completed fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. 
 Legal Proceedings 

None. 

Item 1A. 
 Risk Factors 

As a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this Quarterly Report are any of the risks described in our Registration Statement filed with the SEC and declared effective on September 19, 2022. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Registration Statement filed with the SEC and declared effective on September 19, 2022, and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. 

Item 2. 
 Unregistered Sale of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 

(a) Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 

None. 

(b) Use of Proceeds from the Public Offering 

The securities sold in our initial public offering were registered under the Securities Act on a registration statement on Form S-1 (No. 333-266387), as amended. The SEC declared the registration statement effective on September 19, 2022. There have been no material changes to the planned use of proceeds from our initial public offering as described in our final prospectus dated September 19, 2022, and our other periodic reports previously filed with the SEC. 

(c) Purchase of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers 

On June 11, 2024, the Company held a Special Meeting of Stockholders (the June 2024 Meeting ). At the Meeting, the Company s stockholders approved the Charter Amendment, which further extends the date by which the Company must consummate its initial business combination by an additional six-months pursuant to six one-month extensions, from June 22, 2024 to December 22, 2024 (the Second New Termination Date ), provided that the sponsor or its designees deposit into the trust account approximately 22,740 prior to the commencement of each extension period. At the June 2024 Meeting, Stockholders holding 4,010,928 shares of common stock exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at an approximate price of 11.12 per share of the funds in the Trust Account. As a result, approximately 44,605,448 was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders. The Company has made five monthly extension payments in the Trust Account to extend the period of time by which it has to consummate its initial business combination to November 22, 2024.
