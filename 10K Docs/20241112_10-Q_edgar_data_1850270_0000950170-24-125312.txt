ProKidney Corp. 
 Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
 . SCS was incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. On January 18, 2022, SCS executed a definitive business combination agreement (the Business Combination Agreement ), with ProKidney LP PKLP ), a limited partnership under the laws and regulations of Ireland. Pursuant to the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, PKLP became a subsidiary of SCS and was organized in an umbrella partnership corporation Up-C structure, which would provide potential future tax benefits for SCS when the equity holders ultimately exchanged their pass-through interests for Class A ordinary shares. The business combination between SCS and PKLP (the Business Combination closed (the Closing on July 11, 2022 (the Closing Date ). Upon consummation of the transaction, SCS changed its name to ProKidney Corp. The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization transaction between entities under common control, through which PKLP was considered the accounting acquiror and predecessor entity. The Business Combination was reflected as the equivalent of PKLP issuing stock for the net assets of SCS accompanied by a recapitalization with no goodwill or intangible assets recognized. ProKidney Corp., through its operating subsidiaries, ProKidney, which is incorporated under the Cayman Islands Companies Act (as amended) as an exempted company ProKidney-KY and ProKidney LLC, a limited liability company under the laws of Delaware ProKidney-US is focused on the development of rilparencel, which has the potential to preserve kidney function in patients with chronic kidney disease or delay or eliminate the need for dialysis and organ transplantation. Principles of Consolidation ProKidney is a holding company, and its principal asset is a controlling equity interest in PKLP and its wholly-owned operating subsidiaries ProKidney-KY and ProKidney-US. The Company has determined that PKLP is a variable-interest entity for accounting purposes and that ProKidney is the primary beneficiary of PKLP because (through its managing member interest in PKLP and the fact that the senior management of ProKidney is also the senior management of PKLP) it has the power and benefits to direct all of the activities of PKLP, which include those that most significantly impact PKLP s economic performance. The Company has therefore consolidated PKLP s results pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810, Consolidation in its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. As of September 30, 2024, various holders own non-voting interests in PKLP, representing a economic interest in PKLP, effectively restricting ProKidney s interest to of PKLP s economic results, subject to increase in the future, should ProKidney purchase additional non-voting common units PKLP Units of PKLP, or should the holders of PKLP Units decide to exchange such units (together with shares of Class B ordinary shares) for Class A ordinary shares (or cash) pursuant to the Exchange Agreement (as defined in Note 6). The Company will not be required to provide financial or other support for PKLP. However, ProKidney will control its business and other activities through its managing member interest in PKLP, and its management is the management of PKLP. Nevertheless, because ProKidney will have no material assets other than its interests in PKLP and its subsidiaries, any financial difficulties at PKLP could result in ProKidney recognizing a loss. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

The Company holds debt securities of companies with high credit quality and has determined that there was no material change in the credit risk of its debt securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As such, t he Company has t recognized an allowance for credit losses related to our marketable debt securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 .

of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that the Company actually realizes (or, in some circumstances, the Company is deemed to realize) as a result of certain transactions. As no transactions have occurred which would trigger a liability under this agreement, the Company has not recognized any liability related to this agreement as of September 30, 2024. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, available taxes in the carryback periods, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. There were net unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2024 which, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. We expect none of the gross unrecognized tax benefits will decrease within the next year. There were no significant changes in the Company s uncertain tax positions during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 .

of certain tax savings recognized by the Company, if any, as a result of the increases in tax basis attributable to exchanges by the Closing ProKidney Unitholders of Post-Combination ProKidney Common Units for Class A ordinary shares of the Company or, subject to certain restrictions, cash, pursuant to the Exchange Agreement and certain other tax attributes of PKLP and tax benefits related to entering into the Tax Receivable Agreement. Earnout Rights At the Closing, certain shareholders were issued an aggregate of Earnout Restricted Common Units and Earnout Restricted Stock Rights (collectively, the Earnout Rights ). The Earnout Rights vest in three equal tranches if, during the period after Closing, the VWAP of a Class A ordinary share reaches per share, per share and per share. Likewise, the Earnout Rights will vest upon a change of control with a per share price exceeding those same VWAP thresholds within a five-year period immediately following the Closing. Upon vesting, the Earnout Rights will automatically convert into Post Combination ProKidney Common Units and Class B ordinary shares.

noncontrolling interest in PKLP (see Note 1). The Exchange Agreement requires the surrender of an equal number of Post-Combination ProKidney Common Units and Class B ordinary shares for (i) Class A ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis or (ii) cash (based on the fair market value of the Class A ordinary shares as determined pursuant to the Exchange Agreement), at the Company s option (as the managing member of PKLP), subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for share splits, share dividends and reclassifications. The exchange value is determined based on a five-day VWAP of the Class A ordinary shares as defined in the Exchange Agreement, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for share splits, share dividends and reclassifications. The redeemable noncontrolling interest is recognized at the higher of (1) its initial fair value plus accumulated earnings/losses associated with the noncontrolling interest or (2) the redemption value as of the balance sheet date. At September 30, 2024, the redeemable noncontrolling interest was recorded based on its initial fair value plus accumulated losses associated with the noncontrolling interest which was higher than the redemption value as of the balance sheet date. Changes in the Company s ownership interest in PKLP while the Company retains its controlling interest in PKLP are accounted for as equity transactions, and the Company is required to adjust noncontrolling interest and equity for such changes.)

On January 17, 2022, PKLP amended and restated its Limited Partnership Agreement (the Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement which provided that certain qualified distribution events would result in holders of Profits Interests receiving disproportionate distributions from PKLP until each such holder s valuation threshold had been reduced to zero in order to catch up such holder s distributions to its pro rata share of aggregate cumulative distributions, and once sufficient distributions to a holder of Profits Interests had been made in accordance with the foregoing, the associated Class B Units of PKLP would automatically be converted into Class A Units of PKLP (as defined in the Limited Partnership Agreement). 
Upon consummation of the Business Combination discussed in Note 1, PKLP s existing Class B and B-1 Units were caught up and were converted into Class A Units of PKLP. The resulting vested and unvested Class A Units of PKLP were then recapitalized into Post-Combination ProKidney Common Units or Restricted Common Units of the Company, respectively. This recapitalization resulted in a decrease in the number of awards held by each participant. As such, the number of Profits Interests and related per unit values within these financial statements have been adjusted to reflect this recapitalization. Upon recapitalization, the Restricted Common Units maintained the vesting schedules associated with the original Profits Interest awards.

 Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company with a transformative proprietary cell therapy platform that has the potential to treat multiple chronic kidney diseases using a patient s own cells isolated from the patient intended for treatment. Our approach seeks to redefine the treatment of chronic kidney disease CKD ), shifting the emphasis away from management of kidney failure to the preservation, if not improvement, of kidney function. Our lead product candidate, rilparencel (which we sometimes refer to as REACT ), is designed to preserve kidney function in a CKD patient s diseased kidneys. Rilparencel is a product that includes autologous Selected Renal Cells SRC prepared from a patient s own (autologous) kidney cells. SRC are formulated into a product for reinjection into the patient s kidneys using a minimally invasive outpatient procedure that is repeatable, if necessary. Because rilparencel is a personalized treatment composed of cells prepared from a patient s own kidney, there is no need for treatment with immunosuppressive therapies that are required during a patient s lifetime when a patient receives a kidney transplant from another, allogeneic donor. 
 We are currently conducting a global Phase 3 development program and one ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial for rilparencel in subjects with moderate to severe diabetic kidney disease DKD ). We also completed a Phase 1 clinical trial for rilparencel in subjects with CKD due to congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract CAKUT for which the last subject visit occurred in January 2023 and the clinical study report was submitted to the United States Food and Drug Administration FDA in December 2023. Rilparencel has, to date, been generally well tolerated by subjects with moderate to severe CKD in Phase 1 and 2 clinical testing. 
 Since our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to organizing and staffing our Company, business and scientific planning, conducting discovery and research activities, acquiring or discovering product candidates, establishing and protecting our intellectual property portfolio, developing and progressing rilparencel, raising capital and preparing for clinical trials, establishing arrangements with third parties for the manufacture of component materials, and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. 
 Recent Developments 
 REGEN-006/PROACT 1 trial: 
 REGEN-006 (PROACT 1) is an ongoing Phase 3, randomized, blinded, bi-lateral kidney dose, sham control arm, controlled safety and efficacy study of rilparencel in subjects with advanced kidney disease caused by type 2 diabetes. The related study protocol has been amended to focus on a subset of patients with Stage 4 CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate eGFR )) between 20 and 30 mL/min/1.73m 2 and late Stage 3b CKD (eGFR between 30 and 35 mL/min/1.73m 2 with accompanying albuminuria (urinary albumin-creatinine ratio UACR between 300 and 5000 mg/g). PROACT 1 has resumed enrolling patients under the amended protocol. 
 24 

REGEN-016/PROACT 2 trial: 
 REGEN-016 (PROACT 2) was a planned Phase 3, randomized, blinded, sham control arm, bi-lateral kidney dose, controlled safety and efficacy study of rilparencel in subjects with Stages 3b and 4 CKD caused by type 2 diabetes (specifically eGFR between 20 and 44 mL/min/1.73m 2 with moderate to severe albuminuria (UACR between 300 and 5,000 mg/g)). 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we completed a comprehensive internal and external review, including engaging with ex-FDA officials and seasoned regulatory experts, to determine the optimal path to bring rilparencel to patients in the U.S. with type 2 diabetes and advanced CKD a market where there is high unmet clinical and economic need. An important conclusion of this review was that under the provisions of the Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy RMAT designation, we believe rilparencel is eligible for initial FDA approval under an expedited approval pathway based upon successful completion of the ongoing Phase 3 REGEN-006 (PROACT 1) trial. We believe that the Phase 3 REGEN-016 (PROACT 2) trial is not required for initial U.S. registration. Thus, we have discontinued PROACT 2, which was focused on enrollment outside the U.S. 
 In October 2024, we had a Type B meeting with the FDA to discuss updates to rilparencel s registrational trial strategy. The FDA confirmed that PROACT 1 could be sufficient to support a potential Biologics License Application BLA submission. Additionally,the FDA confirmed that the accelerated approval pathway is available to rilparencel and that the Company could consider eGFR slope as a surrogate endpoint for accelerated approval. We will continue to engage with the FDA, under our RMAT designation, to further define the details supporting this accelerated pathway. 
 Real Estate Matters: 
 Due to a change in the planned use for our Greensboro, North Carolina facility, we performed an impairment analysis to compare the building s carrying value with its estimated fair value. This analysis resulted in the recognition of a non-cash impairment charge of 5.3 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Financial Operations Overview 
 Revenue 
 We have not generated any revenue since our inception and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future, if at all. If our development efforts for rilparencel or any other product candidates are successful and result in marketing approval, or if we enter into collaboration or license agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from a combination of product sales or payments from such agreements. 
 
 Expenses 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with our research and development activities, including the development of rilparencel. 
 Research and development costs include: 
 external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with CROs and other scientific development services; 

costs of other outside consultants, including their fees and related travel expenses; 

costs related to compliance with quality and regulatory requirements; 

costs of laboratory supplies and acquiring and developing clinical trial materials; 

payments made under third-party licensing agreements; 

personnel-related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation expenses, for individuals involved in research and development activities; and 

facilities, depreciation and other allocated expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent, insurance and other internal operating costs. 

We expense research and development costs as incurred. We recognize external development costs based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our vendors. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual agreements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets as prepaid clinical or as a component of total accrued expenses and other. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are deferred and capitalized, even when there is 
 25 

no alternative future use for the research and development. The capitalized amounts are recorded as prepaid clinical and are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed. 
 Research and development activities are central to our business model. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase significantly for the foreseeable future as rilparencel moves into later stages of clinical development. 
 The successful development of rilparencel and any product candidates we may develop in the future is highly uncertain. Therefore, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development and commercialization of any of our product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from the sale of rilparencel or potential future product candidates, if approved. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing product candidates, many of which are outside of our control, including the uncertainty of: 
 the timing and progress of non-clinical and clinical development activities; 

the number and scope of non-clinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue; 

our ability to maintain our current research and development programs and to establish new ones; 

establishing an appropriate safety-profile; 

the number of sites and patients involved in our clinical trials; 

the countries in which the clinical trials are conducted; 

per patient trial costs; 

successful patient enrollment in, and the initiation of, clinical trials, as well as drop out or discontinuation rates; 

the successful completion of clinical trials with safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities; 

the number of trials required for regulatory approval; 

the timing, receipt and terms of any regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; 

our ability to establish new licensing or collaboration arrangements; 

the performance of our future collaborators, if any; 

establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers; 

significant and changing government regulation and regulatory guidance; 

the impact of any business interruptions to our operations or to those of the third parties with whom we work; 

obtaining, maintaining, defending and enforcing patient claims or other intellectual property rights; 

the potential benefits of rilparencel over other therapies; 

launching commercial sales of rilparencel, if approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and 

maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of rilparencel following approval. 

Any changes in the outcome of any of these variables could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of our product candidates. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or if we experience significant delays in our clinical trials due to patient enrollment or other reasons, we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. We may never obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, bonuses, benefits and equity-based compensation expenses for individuals involved in our executive, finance, corporate and administrative functions, as well as expenses for outside professional services, including legal, audit, accounting and tax-related services and other consulting fees, facility-related expenses, which include depreciation costs and other allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance costs, recruiting costs, travel expenses and other general administrative expenses. 
 26 

We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase significantly for the foreseeable future as our business expands and we hire additional personnel to support our operations. We also anticipate increased expenses associated with being a public company, including costs for legal, audit, accounting, investor and public relations, tax-related services, director and officer insurance, and regulatory costs related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC as well as listing standards applicable to companies listed on a national securities exchange. 
 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 Other income consists primarily of interest income earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Income tax expense reflects federal and state taxes on income earned by our subsidiary that is organized as a C corporation for U.S. income tax purposes.

Research and development expenses 
 The decrease in research and development expenses of approximately 0.9 million was primarily driven by the following: 
 decreases in costs for clinical operations of approximately 2.5 million, primarily due to wind down of activities related to PROACT 2 as well as decreases in the costs for other trials, 

decreases in equity-based compensation costs of approximately 1.9 million driven by awards forfeited by terminated employees as well as lower valuations of awards granted in the current year, 

decreases in spending of approximately 1.8 million related to manufacturing process development; offset by; 

increases in cash-based compensation costs of approximately 3.5 million due to the hiring of additional personnel particularly in the areas of clinical development, manufacturing and quality as we move forward with our clinical programs; and 

increases in operational costs of 1.4 million as we continue to expand operations and purchase materials to support our Phase 3 clinical program. 

General and administrative expenses 
 The increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately 3.3 million was primarily driven by the following: 
 
 the recognition of an impairment charge of 5.3 million related to our Greensboro facility; 

increases in cash-based compensation of approximately 2.0 million related to the hiring of new employees and severance costs for terminated employees; offset by; 

27 

decreases in equity-based compensation of approximately 4.1 million due to lower expenses in the 2024 period driven by the impact of forfeitures of awards made to executives. 

Income tax (benefit) expense 
 The change in income tax (benefit) expense is due to the impact of the change in the treatment of specified research and development expenses by our U.S. subsidiary due to recent guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service such that these costs are no longer required to be capitalized and amortized ratably over a five-year period.

Research and development expenses 
 The increase in research and development expenses of approximately 3.7 million was primarily driven by the following: 
 increases in cash-based compensation costs of approximately 9.8 million due to the hiring of additional personnel particularly in the areas of clinical development, manufacturing and quality as we move forward with our clinical programs, 

increases in professional fees of 4.4 million related to the remediation of quality and manufacturing compliance deficiencies; 

increases in operational and material costs of 4.1 million as we continue to expand operations and purchase materials to support our Phase 3 clinical trials, offset by; 

decreases in spending of approximately 7.1 million related to manufacturing process development; 

decreases in equity-based compensation costs of 3.8 million associated with lower valuations of equity-based awards granted in the current period coupled with the impact of forfeitures of awards for terminated employees; and 

decreases in clinical study costs of approximately 3.7 million primarily due to the impact of the pause of manufacturing and its impact on our Phase 3 program as well as the levels of activity ongoing with our other clinical trials. 

General and administrative expenses 
 The increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately 1.1 million was primarily driven by the following: 
 
 the recognition of an impairment charge of 5.3 million related to our Greensboro facility; 

increases in cash-based compensation of approximately 6.0 million related to the hiring of new employees; offset by; 

decreases in equity-based compensation of approximately 11.0 million due to lower expenses in the 2024 period driven by the impact of forfeitures of awards made to executives. 

28 

Income tax expense 
 The change in income tax (benefit) expense was driven by a change in the treatment of specified research and development expenses by our U.S. subsidiary due to recent guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service such that these costs are no longer required to be capitalized and amortized ratably over a five-year period. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of liquidity 
 Since our inception, we have not recognized any revenue and have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We have not yet commercialized any product and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any products for several years, if at all. From our inception through September 30, 2024, we funded our operations primarily through capital contributions from the holders of PKLP, the proceeds obtained through the Business Combination and related private placement financing, and an underwritten public offering and registered direct offering in June 2024. 
 As noted above, in June 2024, the Company sold 46,886,452 of its Class A ordinary shares in an underwritten public offering at a price of 2.42 per share. Additionally, in June 2024, the Company sold 11,030,574 of its Class A ordinary shares to certain investment entities at a price of 2.42 per share in a concurrent registered direct offering pursuant to share purchase agreements. The net proceeds to the Company from the offerings were approximately 136.7 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by the Company. The shares were offered and sold pursuant to the Company s shelf registration statement on Form S-3. 
 In January 2024, we entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement SM Sales Agreement with Jefferies LLC Jefferies as the sales agent, pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, through Jefferies, our Class A ordinary shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 100.0 million by any method deemed to be an at the market offering as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act. The shares are offered and sold pursuant to the Company s shelf registration statement on Form S-3. As of September 30, 2024, we have sold 7.9 million worth of Class A ordinary shares under the Sales Agreement for net proceeds of 7.7 million, leaving 92.1 million available to be sold. 
 We expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held at September 30, 2024, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into mid-2026. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could exhaust our capital resources sooner than we expect. 
 We expect our expenses to increase substantially if, and as, we: 
 initiate and continue research and clinical development of our product candidates, including in particular our clinical trials for rilparencel; 

incur third-party manufacturing costs to support our non-clinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidate and, if approved, its commercialization; 

seek to identify and develop additional product candidates; 

make investment in developing internal manufacturing capabilities; and 

seek regulatory and marketing approvals for our product candidates. 

In addition, since the closing of the Business Combination we have begun incurring additional costs associated with operating as a public company, including significant legal, audit, accounting, investor and public relations, regulatory, tax-related, director and officer insurance premiums and other expenses. Developing pharmaceutical products, including conducting clinical trials, is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval for any product candidates or generate revenue from the sale of any product candidate for which we may obtain marketing approval. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of product that we do not expect to be commercially available for at least several years, if ever. 
 As a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through the public or private sale of equity, government or private party grants, debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our shareholders will be or could be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our shareholders. Debt financing and equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we are unable to obtain additional funding, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs, product portfolio expansion or 
 29 

any commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect our business prospects, or we may be unable to continue operations. If we raise funds through strategic collaborations or other similar arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technology, future- revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or may have to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us and/or may reduce the value of our shares. Our ability to raise additional funds may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we cannot predict the timing or amount of increased expenses, and there is no assurance that we will ever be profitable or generate positive cash flow from operating activities.

 Net cash used in operating activities was approximately 102.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting a net loss of approximately 114.9 million and uses driven by changes in working capital of approximately 13.6 million. Such uses were partially offset by non-cash charges and gains on investments of 26.1 million. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of equity-based compensation expense of 22.4 million, an impairment charge of 5.3 million and depreciation and amortization expense of 3.9 million. The changes in working capital primarily relate to the timing of payments made to our vendors for services performed and the recognition of receivable amounts related to interest on our marketable security investments. 
 Net cash used in operating activities was approximately 64.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting net loss of 113.7 million, partially offset cash provided by changes in working capital of approximately 12.8 million and non-cash charges and gains on investments of 36.2 million. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of equity-based compensation expense of 37.2 million and depreciation and amortization expense of 2.7 million. 
 The approximately 37.4 million increase in cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by an increase in net loss after adjusting for the non-cash charges and gains on investments of approximately 11.3 million coupled with an increase in the use of cash related to the timing of payments to our vendors and receipt of interest amounts due. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was approximately 5.3 million and (234.1 million) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The cash provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to withdrawal of cash from our investments for use in operations. The cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was driven by the investment of a portion of the proceeds raised through the Business Combination in marketable securities as well as the purchase of our facility in Greensboro, North Carolina. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash from financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes proceeds of 144.3 million related to the sale of our Class A ordinary shares. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was an insignificant amount.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements. Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 A description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations is disclosed in Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 JOBS Act Accounting Election 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended (the JOBS Act ). The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies, allowing them to delay the adoption of those standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period under the JOBS Act. As a result, our consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of companies that are required to comply with the effective dates for new or revised accounting standards that are applicable to public companies, which may make our ordinary shares less attractive to investors. 
 Item 3 . Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 The Company s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company s investment portfolio. The goals of our investment strategy are preservation of capital, fulfillment of liquidity needs and fiduciary control of cash and investments. We also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk. To achieve our goals, we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities that management believes to be of high credit quality. All securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged and are, due to their short-term nature, subject to minimal interest rate risk. Because of the short-term maturities of our investments, we do not believe that an increase in market rates would have a material negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio. 
 Inflation Risk 
 We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, other than its impact on the general economy. To the extent our costs are impacted by general inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases or manufacturing efficiencies. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 We do not have any material foreign currency exposure. 
 Item 4 . Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in causing material information relating to us (including our consolidated subsidiaries) to be recorded, processed, 
 31 

summarized and reported by management on a timely basis and to ensure the quality and timeliness of our public disclosures pursuant to SEC disclosure obligations. 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, with the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error and mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of controls. 
 The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or because the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected. 
 Changes to Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Website Availability of Reports and other Corporate Governance Information 
 The Company maintains a comprehensive corporate governance program, including Corporate Governance Guidelines for its Board of Directors, Board Guidelines for Assessing Director Independence and charters for its Audit Committee, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and Talent and Compensation Committee. The Company maintains a corporate investor relations website, https://investors.prokidney.com/ , where stockholders and other interested persons may review, without charge, among other things, corporate governance materials and certain SEC filings, which are generally available on the same business day as the filing date with the SEC on the SEC s website http://www.sec.gov. The contents of our website are not made a part of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1 . Legal Proceedings. 
 We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings. 
 Item 1A . Risk Factors.

These risks are discussed more fully in the section entitled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 22, 2024 (the 2023 Annual Report ). There have been no material changes to the risk factors described in the 2023 Annual Report.
