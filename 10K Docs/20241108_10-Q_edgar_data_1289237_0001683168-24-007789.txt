 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

investment in National Beef Packing Company, LLC (NBP) is accounted for using the equity method of accounting, as the Company
has the ability to exercise significant influence over NBP, but does not have financial or operational control. 

Operating losses, diminished cash flows, economic
and industry events, pandemics, such as coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and a variety of other factors may result in a decrease in the
value of the investment in NBP, which may be other than temporary. Such potential decreases in value, if deemed other than temporary,
would cause the Company to record an impairment charge, which may have an impact on the trading values of USPB s Class A and Class
B units. We believe the fair value of our investment in NBP exceeds the carrying value.

In addition to the antitrust litigation, NBP is
subject to an investigation by the United States Department of Justice DOJ and approximately 30 state attorneys general
regarding fed cattle and beef packing markets. NBP has responded to the federal and state requests for information and cooperated
with the investigations. NBP believes it has meritorious defenses to any potential claims that might arise out of these government investigations,
although there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these investigations or the impact on NBP s consolidated financial position,
results of operations and cash flows. 

NBP is a defendant in a putative class action lawsuit
entitled Brown, et al. v. JBS USA Food Company et al. and filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado on November
1, 2022. The defendants filed motions to dismiss, which the court denied except as to NBP s subsidiary, Iowa Premium. The plaintiffs
filed an amended complaint on January 12, 2024. The amended complaint alleges that the defendants directly and through industry wage surveys
and a benchmarking service (i) fixed wages and benefits, and (ii) exchanged information regarding compensation and benefits in an effort
to depress and stabilize wages and benefits in violation of federal antitrust laws. The plaintiffs seek, among other things, treble monetary
damages, pre- and post-judgment interest, declaratory and injunctive relief and the costs of the suit (including attorney fees). NBP believes
it has meritorious defenses to the claims in this case, and if this proceeds to trial, intends to defend the case vigorously; however,
NBP has negotiated a settlement with the plaintiffs in the employee wages and benefits matter. The settlement has been submitted to the
court for approval and NBP has made an accrual for the potential settlement. There can be no assurances, however, as to the outcome of
this case or the impact on the NBP s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

NBP is a party to various other lawsuits and claims
arising out of the operation of its business. Management of NBP believes the ultimate resolution of such matters should not have
a material adverse effect on NBP s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 

USPB is not able to assess what impact, if any,
the actions described above will have on NBP or USPB.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations. 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction
with our financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. 

Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

This report contains forward-looking statements, 
which are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. Forward-looking statements are typically
identified by the words believe , expect , anticipate , intend , estimate ,
and similar expressions. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements as a
result of many factors, including economic conditions generally and in our principal markets, the availability and prices of live cattle
and commodities, food safety, livestock disease, including the identification of cattle with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), competitive
practices and consolidation in the cattle production and processing industries, actions of domestic or foreign governments, hedging risk,
changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, consumer demand and preferences, the cost of compliance with environmental
and health laws, loss of key customers, loss of key employees, labor relations, and consolidation among our customers. 

In light of these risks and uncertainties, there
can be no assurance that the results and events contemplated by the forward-looking information contained in this report will in fact
transpire. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. We do not undertake any obligation to
update or revise any forward-looking statements. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons
acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these factors. Please review Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors ,
included in this report, for other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any such forward-looking
statements. 

Products and Production 

USPB provides an integrated cattle production,
processing and marketing system for the benefit of its members and associates. As the basis of that system, USPB s Class A members
have a guaranteed right plus an obligation (on a one head per Class A unit per delivery year basis) to deliver cattle to USPB, pursuant
to the Uniform Cattle Delivery and Marketing Agreement. USPB facilitates the delivery of cattle to NBP for processing and subsequent product
distribution and marketing. Shortly after the cattle are processed, cattle suppliers receive, at no extra charge, individual animal carcass
data previously considered proprietary by many processors. This carcass data assists producers in refining production methodologies, thereby
improving the product quality and subsequently enhancing the return to the producer. 

We believe the primary advantage of USPB s
ownership in NBP is USPB s ability to provide NBP with a consistent supply of quality beef from a known source, allowing NBP to
target higher margin value-added markets. Consumers have historically demonstrated their willingness and desire to buy branded products
that offer better value in other consumer product markets, with the Certified Angus Beef product line being an example
in the beef industry. 

Investment in National Beef Packing Company, LLC 

NBP processes and sells a comprehensive line
of fresh beef, case-ready products, and beef by-products for domestic and international markets. The largest share of NBP s
revenue is generated from the sale of boxed beef and beef by-products. 

NBP has two beef slaughter and processing facilities
located in southwest Kansas and a third located in central Iowa. In addition, NBP operates a leather tannery, three case-ready manufacturing
facilities, a fresh and frozen hamburger manufacturing facility and a transportation and logistics company that provides refrigerated
and livestock transportation across the U.S. 

NBP s profitability typically fluctuates
seasonally as well as cyclically, based on the availability of fed cattle and the demand for beef and beef by-products. Its profitability
is dependent, in large part, on the spread between its cost for live cattle, the primary raw material for its business, and the value
received from selling boxed beef and other products coupled with its overall volume. NBP operates in a large and fast-moving commodity
market and does not have much influence over the price it pays for cattle or the selling price it receives for the products it produces. 
The NBP financial information provided below has been provided to us by NBP. We have not independently verified the information. 

12 

NBP s revenues in the thirteen-week period
ended September 28, 2024, decreased approximately 3.9 in comparison to the fourteen-week period ended September 30, 2023, primarily due
to decreased production volume related to one less week in the period. NBP s cost of sales decreased by approximately 1.9 for the
thirteen-week period ended September 28, 2024, as compared to the fourteen-week period ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to decreased
production volume. For the thirteen-week period ended September 28, 2024, NBP had net income of 22.0 million compared to net income of
 98.9 million for the fourteen-week period ended September 30, 2023. Lower volume and lower per unit beef processing margin was the key
driver of the decrease in overall profitability in the 2024 period, as compared to the 2023 period. 

NBP s revenues in the thirty-nine week
period ended September 28, 2024, increased approximately 3.1 in comparison to the thirty-nine week period ended September 30, 2023, primarily
due higher average unit selling prices for many of NBP s products. NBP s cost of sales increased by approximately 5.1 for
the thirty-nine week period ended September 28, 2024, as compared to the thirty-nine week period ended September 30, 2023, primarily due
to higher prices for fed cattle. For the thirty-nine week period ended September 28, 2024, NBP had net income of 51.2 million compared
to net income of 248.9 million for the thirty-nine week period ended September 30, 2023. Lower per unit beef processing margin was the
key driver of the decrease in overall profitability in the 2024 period, as compared to the 2023 period. 

On June 10, 2019, USPB and NBP entered into the
First Amended and Restated Cattle Purchase and Sale Agreement (A R Agreement) with USPB. The terms and conditions of the A R Agreement
are substantially the same as those of the Cattle Purchase and Sale Agreement dated December 30, 2011. Per the terms and conditions of
the A R Agreement, NBP is required to purchase through USPB from its owners and associates, and USPB is required to sell and deliver
from its owners and associates to NBP, a base amount of 735,385 (subject to adjustment) head of cattle per year with prices based on those
published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, subject to adjustments for cattle performance. NBP obtained approximately 25 and
26 of its cattle requirements under this agreement during the thirty-nine and thirty-nine week periods ended September 28, 2024 and September
30, 2023, respectively.

for the thirteen-week period ended September 28, 2024 compared to net income of 15.0 million fourteen-week period ended September 30,

million for the thirty-nine week period ended September 28, 2024 compared to other income of 0.5 million for the thirty-nine week period
ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The income in both periods was primarily delivery right lease income, with the 2023 period being

for the thirty-nine week period ended September 28, 2024 compared to net income of 36.9 million thirty-nine week period ended September

of 58.5 million. Our primary sources of liquidity for the first three quarters of fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year 2023 were cash and
available borrowings under the Master Loan Agreement with CoBank.

debt outstanding. We had a 1.0 million revolving term credit commitment with CoBank, all of which was available. USPB was in compliance

thirty-nine week period ended September 28, 2024 was approximately 0.2 million compared to approximately 30.5 million in the thirty-nine
week period ended September 30, 2023. The 30.3 million change was primarily due to a decrease in distributions from NBP. 

14 

Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities was approximately
 10.0 million in the thirty-nine week period ended September 28, 2024 compared to 0.0 million in the thirty-nine week period ended September
30, 2023. The change in the current period was due to a 10 million net increase in investments in Certificates of Deposit. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash used in financing activities was 9.9 million
in the thirty-nine week period ended September 28, 2024 compared to 52.4 million in the thirty-nine week period ended September 30, 2023.
The 42.5 million decrease was due lower member distributions in the current period. 

Master Loan Agreement 

On July 13, 2020, USPB, and CoBank, entered into
a Credit Agreement, Amended and Restated Revolving Term Promissory Note Promissory Note ), and an Affirmation of Pledge
Agreement. 

The Credit Agreement and Promissory Note provides
for a 1.0 million revolving term commitment. The commitment carries a term of five years, maturing on June 30, 2025. All of the 1.0
million revolving credit commitment was available as of September 28, 2024. On July 6, 2023, USPB and CoBank amended the Promissory Note
to provide for an interest rate equal to the Daily Simple SOFR Margin (as defined in the amendment) plus the higher of 0.00 and Daily
Simply SOFR (as defined in the agreement). The Affirmation of Pledge Agreement provides CoBank with a first-priority security interest
in USPB s Membership Interests in, and Distributions from, NBP. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 

The principal market risks affecting USPB s
business are exposure to interest rate risk, to the extent the Company has debt outstanding. As of September 28, 2024, the Company did
not have any outstanding debt. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

We maintain a system of controls and procedures
designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the Financial Statements and other disclosures included in this report,
as well as to safeguard assets from unauthorized use or disposition. We evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the supervision
and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation,
as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in alerting them, in a timely manner, to material information required to be
included in our periodic Securities and Exchange Commission filings. There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial
reporting during the thirty-nine week period ended September 28, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting. The design of any system of controls and procedures is based in part upon certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 

As of September 28, 2024, USPB is not
involved in any litigation. However, because its ownership interest in NBP is USPB s largest asset and because of the cattle procurement
and distribution relationship between USPB and NBP, litigation involving NBP may impact USPB. 

15 

NBP is a defendant in (i) five putative class action
lawsuits in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota alleging that NBP violated some combination of the Sherman
Antitrust Act, the Packers and Stockyards Act, the Commodity Exchange Act, and various state laws and (ii) putative class action lawsuits
in the Supreme Court of British Columbia and the Superior Court of Quebec for the district of Montreal alleging that it violated the Canadian
Competition Act and various provincial laws (the Beef Class Actions ). The Beef Class Actions are entitled In re
Cattle Antitrust Litigation , which was filed originally on April 23, 2019; Peterson et al. v. JBS USA Food Company Holdings, et
al. , which was filed originally on April 26, 2019; In re DPP Beef Litigation , which was filed originally on April 26, 2019;

v. Tyson Foods, Inc., et al. , which was filed originally on October 31, 2022; Giang Bui v. Cargill, Incorporated, et al . which
was filed originally on February 18, 2022; and Sylvie De Bellefeuille v. Cargill, Inc. et al. , which was filed originally on March
24, 2022. Since the original class action complaints were filed, certain purchasers of beef products have opted to file individual
complaints and to proceed with direct actions making similar claims (the Opt-Out Cases ), and others may do so in the future.
The Opt-Out Cases are entitled Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc. and Bi-Lo Holding, LLC v. Cargill, Inc., et al. , which was filed on August
2, 2021 in the United States District Court, Minnesota; Cheney Brothers, Inc. v. Cargill, Inc., et al. , which was filed on January

Eastern District of New York; Glazier Foods Co et al. v. Cargill, Inc., et al. , which was filed originally on December 29, 2023
in the United States District Court, Eastern District of New York; Jetro Holdings, Inc v. Cargill, Inc., et al. , which was filed
originally on December 29, 2023 in the United States District Court, Eastern District of New York; Quality Supply Chain Co-Op, Inc.
v. Cargill, Inc., et al. , which was filed originally on December 29, 2023 in the United States District Court, Eastern District of
New York; and Sodexo, Inc., et al. v. Cargill, Inc., et al. , which was filed originally on April 29, 2024 in the United States
District Court of Maryland, and McDonald s Corporation v. Cargill, Inc., et. al ., which was originally file on October 4,
2024 in the United States District Court, Eastern District of New York. On October 4, 2022, the United States Beef Class Actions and Opt-Out
Cases were consolidated for pretrial proceedings in the United States District Court, Minnesota District under the style In re: Cattle
and Beef Antitrust Litigation . The plaintiffs in these cases seek treble damages and other relief under various laws including the
Sherman Antitrust Act, the Canadian Competition Act, the Packers Stockyards Act, and/or the Commodities Exchange Act and various
state and provincial laws and attorneys fees. NBP believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims in these cases and intends
to defend them vigorously. There can be no assurances, however, as to the outcome of these matters or the impact on NBP s consolidated
financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

16 

In addition to the antitrust litigation, NBP is
subject to an investigation by the United States Department of Justice DOJ and approximately 30 state attorneys general
regarding fed cattle and beef packing markets. NBP has responded to the federal and state requests for information and cooperated
with the investigations. NBP believes it has meritorious defenses to any potential claims that might arise out of these government investigations,
although there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these investigations or the impact on NBP s consolidated financial position,
results of operations and cash flows. 

NBP is a defendant in a putative class action lawsuit
entitled Brown, et al. v. JBS USA Food Company et al . and filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado
on November 1, 2022. The defendants filed motions to dismiss, which the court denied except as to NBP s subsidiary, Iowa Premium.
The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on January 12, 2024. The amended complaint alleges that the defendants directly and through
industry wage surveys and a benchmarking service (i) fixed wages and benefits, and (ii) exchanged information regarding compensation and
benefits in an effort to depress and stabilize wages and benefits in violation of federal antitrust laws. The plaintiffs seek, among other
things, treble monetary damages, pre- and post-judgment interest, declaratory and injunctive relief and the costs of the suit (including
attorney fees). NBP believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims in this case, and if this proceeds to trial, intends to defend
the case vigorously; however, NBP has negotiated a settlement with the plaintiffs in the employee wages and benefits matter. The settlement
has been submitted to the court for approval and NBP has made an accrual for the potential settlement. There can be no assurances, however,
as to the outcome of this case or the impact on the NBP s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

NBP is a party to various other lawsuits and claims
arising out of the operation of its business. Management of NBP believes the ultimate resolution of such matters should not have
a material adverse effect on NBP s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 

USPB is not able to assess what impact, if any,
the actions described above will have on NBP or USPB. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

The risk factors set forth in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 have not materially changed. Please refer to the Company s report on Form

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. 

Not applicable. 

Item 5. Other Information.
