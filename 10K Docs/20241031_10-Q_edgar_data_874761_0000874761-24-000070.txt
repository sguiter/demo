 Restricted cash Debt service reserves and other deposits Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash 
 ASC 450 Liabilities Supplier Finance Programs With some purchases, AES enters into supplier financing arrangements. The Company generally uses an intermediary entity between the supplier and the Company, but sometimes enters into these agreements directly with the supplier, with the goal of securing improved payment terms. These arrangements are included in Supplier financing arrangements on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as the amounts are all due in less than a year; the related interest expense is recorded on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations within Interest expense . The Company had supplier financing arrangements with a total outstanding balance of million and million, as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The agreements ranged from less than million to million with a weighted average interest rate of as of September 30, 2024; as of December 31, 2023, the agreements ranged from less than million to million with a weighted average interest rate of . Of the amounts outstanding under supplier financing arrangements, million and million were guaranteed by the Company as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Tax Credit Transferability The U.S Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA allows us to directly transfer investment tax credits ITCs to unrelated tax credit buyers. The Company accounts for tax credits that it will retain or transfer under ASC 740 Income Taxes , as tax benefit throughout the year the renewables project is placed in service. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company executed agreements to transfer ITCs directly to third parties for million, of which million was allocated to AES and recorded as an income tax benefit to AES, and million was allocated to noncontrolling interests and treated as a contribution from noncontrolling interests. The Company received proceeds from these tax credit transfers of million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and the remaining million during October 2024. The receipt of cash from the transfer of tax credits is treated as an operating cash flow on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

 For the Argentine peso foreign currency derivatives, increases in the estimate of the above exchange rate would increase the value of the derivative. For the CAISO energy swap, increases in the estimate above would decrease the value of the derivative. 
 Contingent consideration is primarily related to future milestone payments associated with acquisitions of renewables development projects. The estimated fair value of contingent consideration is determined using probability-weighted discounted cash flows based on internal forecasts, which are considered Level 3 inputs. Changes in Level 3 inputs, particularly changes in the probability of achieving development milestones, could result in material changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration and could materially impact the amount of expense or income recorded each reporting period. Contingent consideration is updated quarterly with any prospective changes in fair value recorded through earnings. 
 Nonrecurring Measurements 
 The Company measures fair value using the applicable fair value measurement guidance. Impairment expense, shown as pre-tax loss below, is measured by comparing the fair value at the evaluation date to the then-latest available carrying amount and is included in Asset impairment expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 AES Clean Energy tax equity partnerships 
 Potengi common and preferred stock AES Clean Energy Development common stock Total redeemable stock of subsidiaries 
 AES Clean Energy Development As part of the formation of AES Clean Energy Development in February 2021, the noncontrolling interest partner received certain partnership rights that would enable them to exit in the future. As a result, the noncontrolling ownership interest was considered temporary equity. In May 2024, these redemption features expired without being exercised and the noncontrolling ownership interest of million was reclassified from Redeemable stock of subsidiaries to Noncontrolling interests on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. AES Clean Energy Development is reported in the Renewables SBU reportable segment. 
 AES Clean Energy Tax Equity Partnerships The majority of solar projects in the U.S. have been financed with tax equity structures, in which tax equity investors receive a portion of the economic attributes of the facilities, including tax attributes, that vary over the life of the projects. In some cases, these agreements contain certain partnership rights, though not currently in effect, that may enable the tax equity investor to exit in the future. As a result, the noncontrolling ownership interest is considered temporary equity. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, AES Clean Energy, through multiple transactions, sold noncontrolling interests in project companies to tax equity investors, resulting in increases to Redeemable stock of subsidiaries of million. 
 During the second and third quarters of 2024, the Chevelon Butte Phase II, Kuihelani, and Silver Peak renewables projects reached commercial operations.

Each Equity Unit had a stated amount of and was initially issued as a Corporate Unit, consisting of a forward stock purchase contract 2024 Purchase Contracts and a undivided beneficial ownership interest in one share of Series A Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, issued without par and with a liquidation preference of per share Series A Preferred Stock ). 
 The Company concluded that the Equity Units should be accounted for as one unit of account based on the economic linkage between the 2024 Purchase Contracts and the Series A Preferred Stock, as well as the Company's assessment of the applicable accounting guidance relating to combining freestanding instruments. The Equity Units represent mandatorily convertible preferred stock. Accordingly, the shares associated with the combined instrument were reflected in diluted earnings per share using the if-converted method. 
 In conjunction with the issuance of the Equity Units, the Company received approximately billion in proceeds, net of underwriting costs and commissions, before offering expenses. The proceeds for the issuance of shares were attributed to the Series A Preferred Stock for million and million for the present value of the quarterly payments due to holders of the 2024 Purchase Contracts ("Contract Adjustment Payments"). The proceeds were used for the development of the AES renewables businesses, U.S. utility businesses, LNG infrastructure, and for other developments determined by management. 
 The Series A Preferred Stock did not bear any dividends and the liquidation preference of the convertible preferred stock did not accrete. The Series A Preferred Stock had no maturity date and would remain outstanding unless converted by holders or redeemed by the Company. Holders of the preferred shares had limited voting rights. The Series A Preferred Stock was pledged as collateral to support holders purchase obligations under the 2024 Purchase Contracts, which obligated the holders to purchase, on February 15, 2024, for a price of in cash, a maximum number of shares of the Company s common stock (subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments). The initial settlement rate determining the number of shares that each holder must purchase could not exceed the maximum settlement rate and was determined over a market value averaging period preceding February 15, 2024. The initial maximum settlement rate of was calculated using an initial reference price of , equal to the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock on March 4, 2021. On February 15, 2024, the Series A Preferred Stock was tendered to satisfy the 2024 Purchase Contract s settlement price and the Corporate Units were converted into shares of the Company s common stock at the maximum settlement rate of , equivalent to a reference price of . The Series A Preferred Stock was canceled and shares of AES common stock were issued upon conversion. 
 The Company paid Contract Adjustment Payments to the holders of the 2024 Purchase Contracts at a rate of per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on February 15, May 15, August 15, and November 15, commencing on May 15, 2021. The million present value of the Contract Adjustment Payments at inception reduced the Series A Preferred Stock. As each quarterly Contract Adjustment Payment was made, the related liability was reduced and the difference between the cash payment and the present value accreted to interest expense, approximately million over the three-year term. The final Contract Adjustment Payments were made on February 15, 2024. 
 Equity Transactions with Noncontrolling Interests 
 AES Clean Energy Tax Equity Partnerships The majority of solar projects in the U.S. have been financed with tax equity structures, in which tax equity investors receive a portion of the economic attributes of the facilities, including tax attributes, that vary over the life of the projects. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, AES Clean Energy Development and AES Renewable Holdings, through multiple transactions, sold noncontrolling interests in project companies to tax equity investors, resulting in increases to NCI of million and million, respectively.

 SBUs, mainly organized by technology, led by our President and Chief Executive Officer. Using the accounting guidance on segment reporting, the Company determined that its operating segments are aligned with its reportable segments corresponding to its SBUs. 
 Renewables Solar, wind, energy storage, and hydro generation facilities; 
 Utilities AES Indiana, AES Ohio, and AES El Salvador regulated utilities and their generation facilities; 
 Energy Infrastructure Natural gas, LNG, coal, pet coke, diesel, and oil generation facilities, and our businesses in Chile, which have a mix of generation sources, including renewables, that are pooled to service our existing PPAs; and 
 New Energy Technologies Green hydrogen initiatives and investments in Fluence, Uplight, 5B, and other new and innovative energy technology businesses. 
 Our Renewables, Utilities, and Energy Infrastructure SBUs participate in our generation business line, in which we own and/or operate power plants to generate and sell power to customers, such as utilities, industrial users, and other intermediaries. Our Utilities SBU participates in our utilities business line, in which we own and/or operate utilities to generate or purchase, distribute, transmit, and sell electricity to end-user customers in the residential, commercial, industrial, and governmental sectors within a defined service area. In certain circumstances, our utilities also generate and sell electricity on the wholesale market. Our New Energy Technologies SBU includes investments in new and innovative technologies to support leading-edge greener energy solutions. 
 Included in Corporate and Other are the results of the AES self-insurance company, corporate overhead costs which are not directly associated with the operations of our reportable segments, and certain intercompany charges such as self-insurance premiums which are fully eliminated in consolidation. 
 The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as its primary segment performance measure. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, is defined by the Company as earnings before interest income and expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for the impact of NCI and interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of our equity affiliates, and adding back interest income recognized under service concession arrangements; excluding gains or losses of both consolidated entities and entities accounted for under the equity method due to (a) unrealized gains or losses pertaining to derivative transactions, equity securities, and financial assets and liabilities measured using the fair value option; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses, benefits, and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, and gains and losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases; (d) losses due to impairments; and (e) gains, losses, and costs due to the early retirement of debt or troubled debt restructuring. 
 The Company has concluded Adjusted EBITDA better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company and is the most relevant measure considered in the Company's internal evaluation of the financial performance of its segments. Additionally, given its large number of businesses and overall complexity, the Company concluded that Adjusted EBITDA is a more transparent measure that better assists investors in determining which businesses have the greatest impact on the Company's results. 
 Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA are presented before inter-segment eliminations, which includes the effect of intercompany transactions with other segments except for charges for certain management fees and the write-off of intercompany balances, as applicable. All intra-segment activity has been eliminated within the segment. Inter-segment activity has been eliminated within the total consolidated results.

 Contract Balances The timing of revenue recognition, billings, and cash collections results in accounts receivable and contract liabilities. The contract liabilities from contracts with customers were million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized revenue of million and million, respectively, that was included in the corresponding contract liability balance at the beginning of the periods. 
 In June 2023, the Company closed on an agreement to terminate the PPA for the Warrior Run coal-fired power plant for total consideration of million, to be paid by the offtaker through the end of the previous contract term in January 2030. Under the termination agreement, the plant continued providing capacity through May 2024. The termination represented a contract modification under which the discounted termination payments, as well as a pre-existing contract liability, were recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the remaining performance obligation period for approximately million per month. On February 1, 2024, the Company executed a receivable sale agreement to transfer all of its rights, title, and interest in the remaining future cash flows under this agreement. At the time of execution, the transaction was considered a sale of future revenue under U.S. GAAP, and as such, the net proceeds of million were recorded as debt . Upon completion of the remaining performance obligation in May 2024, the corresponding receivable balance of million, net of valuation allowance of million, and the remaining debt balance of million were derecognized. 
 A significant financing arrangement exists for our Mong Duong plant in Vietnam. The plant was constructed under a build, operate, and transfer contract and will be transferred to the Vietnamese government after the completion of a 25-year PPA. The performance obligation to construct the facility was substantially completed in 2015. Contract consideration related to the construction, but not yet collected through the 25-year PPA, was reflected on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Mong Duong met the held-for-sale criteria and the loan receivable balance of billion and billion, net of CECL reserves of million and million, respectively, was classified in held-for-sale assets. Of the loan receivable balance, million and million, respectively, was classified in Current held-for-sale assets , and million and million, respectively, was classified in Noncurrent held-for-sale assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Remaining Performance Obligations The transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents future consideration for unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations at the end of the reporting period. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was million, primarily consisting of fixed consideration for the sale of renewable energy

 Overview of Our Business 
 We are a diversified power generation and utility company organized into the following four SBUs, mainly organized by technology: Renewables (solar, wind, energy storage, and hydro), Utilities (AES Indiana, AES Ohio, and AES El Salvador), Energy Infrastructure (natural gas, LNG, coal, pet coke, diesel, and oil), and New Energy Technologies (green hydrogen, Fluence, Uplight, and 5B). Our businesses in Chile, which have a mix of generation sources, including renewables, are also included within the Energy Infrastructure SBU, as the generation from all sources is pooled to service our existing PPAs. For additional information regarding our business, see Item 1. Business of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 We have two lines of business: generation and utilities. Our Renewables, Utilities, and Energy Infrastructure SBUs participate in our first business line, generation, in which we own and/or operate power plants to generate and sell power to customers, such as utilities, industrial users, and other intermediaries. Our Utilities SBU participates in our second business line, utilities, in which we own and/or operate utilities to generate or purchase, distribute, transmit, and sell electricity to end-user customers in the residential, commercial, industrial, and governmental sectors within a defined service area. In certain circumstances, our utilities also generate and sell electricity on the wholesale market. Our New Energy Technologies SBU includes investments in new and innovative technologies to support leading-edge greener energy solutions. 
 
 Executive Summary 
 Compared with last year, third quarter net income decreased 81 million, from 291 million to 210 million. This decrease is the result of lower impairments and lower unrealized foreign currency losses in the current year, and higher contributions from renewables projects placed in service; partially offset by lower contributions from the Energy Infrastructure SBU. 
 Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, decreased 298 million, from 990 million to 692 million, driven by lower margins at the Energy Infrastructure SBU primarily due to the end of commercial operations at Warrior Run and prior year margin at the hedged merchant Southland facilities that are contracted primarily for capacity in the current year, and record-breaking drought conditions in South America at the Renewables SBU. This was partially offset by higher revenues from new projects at the Renewables SBU. 
 Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes, a non-GAAP measure, increased 160 million, from 1,008 million to 1,168 million primarily due to higher realized tax attributes driven by more renewables projects placed in service, partially offset by the drivers above. 

38 | The AES Corporation | September 30, 2024 Form 10-Q 

 Compared with last year, third quarter diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 0.40, from 0.32 to 0.72. This increase is mainly driven by higher contributions from renewables projects placed in service in the current year, lower long-lived asset impairments in the current year, and prior year unrealized foreign currency losses at the Energy Infrastructure SBU. This was partially offset by lower earnings at the Energy Infrastructure SBU due to end of commercial operations at Warrior Run. 
 Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP measure, increased 0.11 from 0.60 to 0.71, mainly driven by a lower adjusted tax rate and higher contributions from renewables projects placed in service in the current year, partially offset by lower contributions from the Energy Infrastructure SBU. 
 Compared with last year, net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 12 million, from 461 million to 449 million. This decrease is the result of higher interest expense and losses at commencement of sales-type leases at the Renewables SBU; partially offset by favorable contributions at the Utilities and New Energy Technologies SBUs, lower unrealized foreign currency losses in the current year, and higher contributions from renewables projects placed in service in the current year. 
 Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, decreased 208 million, from 2,187 million to 1,979 million, mainly driven by lower margins at the Energy Infrastructure SBU due to prior year margin at the hedged merchant Southland facilities that are contracted primarily for capacity in the current year and higher outages, and record-breaking drought conditions and outages in Colombia at the Renewables SBU; partially offset by higher contributions at the Utilities SBU, higher revenues from new projects at the Renewables SBU, and lower losses from affiliates at the New Energy Technologies SBU. 
 Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes, a non-GAAP measure, increased 618 million, from 2,256 million to 2,874 million, primarily due to higher realized tax attributes driven by more renewables projects placed in service, partially offset by the drivers above. 
 Compared with last year, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.10, from 0.48 to 1.58. This increase is mainly driven by higher contributions from renewables projects placed in service in the current year, prior year unrealized foreign currency losses at the Energy Infrastructure SBU, lower long-lived asset impairments in the current year, and lower income tax expense. This was partially offset by lower margins due to outages, the end of commercial operations at Warrior Run, higher interest expense, and losses at commencement of sales-type leases at the Renewables SBU. 
 Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP measure, increased 0.57 from 1.03 to 1.60, mainly driven by a lower adjusted tax rate, higher contributions from renewables projects placed in service in the current year, and higher contributions from the Utilities SBU; partially offset by lower contributions from the Energy Infrastructure SBU.

 Components of Revenue, Cost of Sales, and Operating Margin Revenue includes revenue earned from the sale of energy from our utilities and the production and sale of energy from our generation plants, which are classified as regulated and non-regulated , respectively, on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Revenue also includes the gains or losses on derivatives associated with the sale of electricity. 
 Cost of sales includes costs incurred directly by the businesses in the ordinary course of business. Examples include electricity and fuel purchases, operations and maintenance costs, depreciation and amortization expenses, bad debt expense and recoveries, and general administrative and support costs (including employee-related costs directly associated with the operations of the business). Cost of sales also includes the gains or losses on derivatives associated with the purchase of electricity or fuel. 
 Operating margin is defined as revenue less cost of sales.

 Consolidated Revenue and Operating Margin 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 Revenue 
 (in millions) 
 
 Consolidated Revenue Revenue decreased 145 million, or 4 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by: 
 238 million at Energy Infrastructure driven by the end of commercial operations at Warrior Run in the second quarter of 2024, lower regulated contract sales and prices, and the impact of the depreciation of the Argentine peso. 
 This unfavorable impact was partially offset by increases of: 
 81 million at Utilities mainly driven by an increase in transmission and distribution revenues due to higher rates as a result of the 2024 Base Rate Order and higher demand due to favorable weather; and 
 18 million at Renewables mainly driven by new projects in service, and the impact of better hydrology in Panama; partially offset by the impact of record-breaking drought conditions and outages in Colombia and the depreciation of the Brazilian real. 
 Operating Margin 
 (in millions) 
 
 Consolidated Operating Margin Operating margin decreased 196 million, or 21 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by: 
 149 million at Energy Infrastructure mainly driven by the end of commercial operations at Warrior Run in the second quarter of 2024, higher energy margin from our hedged merchant Southland facilities in the prior year that are contracted primarily for capacity in the current year, lower thermal dispatch, and higher outages; partially offset by favorable LNG transactions and lower fixed costs; and 
 43 million at Renewables mainly driven by outages due to a flooding incident and record-breaking drought conditions in Colombia, as well as the depreciation of the Brazilian real; partially offset by higher generation due to better hydrology in Panama, new businesses operating in our portfolio, and unrealized derivative gains. 
 These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by an increase of 5 million at Utilities mainly driven by an increase in transmission and rider revenues, higher retail rates as a result of the 2024 Base Rate Order, and higher 

43 | The AES Corporation | September 30, 2024 Form 10-Q 

 demand due to the impact of weather; partially offset by the prior year deferral of power purchase costs associated with the approval of ESP 4, and higher fixed costs. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 Revenue 
 (in millions) 
 
 Consolidated Revenue Revenue decreased 384 million, or 4 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven by: 
 533 million at Energy Infrastructure primarily driven by lower regulated contract sales and prices, lower CO 2 purchases passed through due to lower production, the impact of the depreciation of the Argentine peso, higher revenues from our hedged merchant Southland facilities in the prior year that are contracted primarily for capacity in the current year, and lower generation due to higher outages; partially offset by higher revenues due to a PPA termination agreement; and 
 74 million at New Energy Technologies mainly driven by the sale of the Fallbrook project in March 2023. 
 These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by increases of: 
 197 million at Renewables mainly driven by new projects in service, unrealized derivative gains, and the appreciation of the Colombian peso; partially offset by higher outages and record-breaking drought conditions in Colombia, and the depreciation of the Brazilian real; and 
 27 million at Utilities mainly driven by an increase in transmission and distribution revenues due to higher rates, and higher demand due to favorable weather; partially offset by lower Fuel Adjustment Charge rider revenue. 
 Operating Margin 
 (in millions) 
 
 Consolidated Operating Margin Operating margin decreased 116 million, or 6 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven by: 
 105 million at Renewables driven by higher fixed costs, lower wind and solar availability, and record-breaking drought conditions and outage due to a flooding incident in Colombia; partially offset by unrealized derivative gains; and 
 94 million at Energy Infrastructure mainly driven by higher outages, higher energy margin from our hedged merchant Southland facilities in the prior year that are contracted primarily for capacity in the current year, 

44 | The AES Corporation | September 30, 2024 Form 10-Q 

 impact of the selldown of Amman East and IPP4 in Jordan, and lower thermal dispatch; partially offset by higher revenues due to a PPA termination agreement and lower fixed costs. 
 These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by an increase of 90 million at Utilities mainly driven by increases in transmission and rider revenues due to higher TDSIC, ECCRA and DIR, higher demand due to favorable weather, and higher retail rates as a result of the 2024 Base Rate Order; partially offset by the prior year deferral of power purchase costs associated with the approval of ESP 4, and higher fixed costs.

 Consolidated Results of Operations Other 
 
 General and administrative expenses 
 General and administrative expenses decreased 7 million, or 11 , to 57 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 64 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher capitalization of business development costs, partially offset by higher people costs. 
 General and administrative expenses increased 7 million, or 4 , to 198 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 191 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increased business development activity and higher people costs. 
 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense increased 53 million, or 16 , to 379 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 326 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase is primarily due to new debt issued at the Renewables and Utilities SBUs, and a higher weighted average interest rate and debt balance at the Parent Company; partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest. 
 Interest expense increased 159 million, or 16 , to 1,125 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 966 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase is primarily due to the drivers above. 
 Interest capitalized during development and construction increased 15 million to 164 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 149 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to more projects in development at the Renewables SBU, higher debt balances, and higher interest rates. 
 Interest capitalized during development and construction increased 95 million to 491 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 396 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the drivers above. 
 
 Interest income 
 Interest income decreased 25 million, or 17 , to 119 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 144 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower short-term investments at the Energy Infrastructure and Renewables SBUs, partially offset by interest recognized on the Stabilization Fund receivables in Chile. 
 Interest income decreased 86 million, or 22 , to 312 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 398 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the drivers above. 
 
 Loss on extinguishment of debt 
 Loss on extinguishment of debt was 11 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to a prepayment at AES Andes. See Note 8 Debt included in Item 1. Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for further information. 
 
 Other income and expense 
 Other income increased 52 million to 64 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 12 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, mainly due to gains on remeasurement of contingent consideration at AES Clean Energy and an indexation adjustment of Stabilization Fund receivables at AES Andes. 

45 | The AES Corporation | September 30, 2024 Form 10-Q 

 Other income increased 84 million to 120 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 36 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, mainly due to gains on remeasurement of contingent consideration at AES Clean Energy, an indexation adjustment of Stabilization Fund receivables at AES Andes, a gain on commencement of a sales-type lease on land, and insurance proceeds primarily associated with property damage at AES Andes. 
 Other expense increased 19 million to 31 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 12 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by losses on remeasurement of contingent consideration at AES Clean Energy. 
 Other expense increased 115 million to 153 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 38 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by losses on commencement of sales-type leases at AES Renewable Holdings, legal expenses and other direct costs related to the troubled debt restructuring at Puerto Rico, and losses on remeasurement of contingent consideration at AES Clean Energy. 
 See Note 15 Other Income and Expense included in Item 1. Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for further information. 
 
 Gain (loss) on disposal and sale of business interests 
 Loss on disposal and sale of business interests was 1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, with no material drivers. 
 Gain on disposal and sale of business interests was 43 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a loss of 4 million for nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven by the gain on dilution of AES ownership interest in Uplight as a result of the AutoGrid acquisition, partially offset by the loss on the selldown of Amman East and IPP4 in Jordan, which is now accounted for as an equity method investment. See Note 7 Investments in and Advances to Affiliates and Note 18 Held-for-Sale and Dispositions for further information. 
 
 Asset impairment expense 
 Asset impairment expense decreased 79 million to 79 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 158 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was due to prior year impairments of million and million at TEG and TEP, respectively, in Mexico due to a reduction in expected cash flows after expiration of the current PPAs, and a million impairment at Amman East and IPP4 in Jordan due to the delay in closing the sale transaction. This was partially offset by current quarter impairments of million and million at AES Brasil and Mong Duong, respectively, due to subsequent impairment analyses after meeting held-for-sale criteria. 
 Asset impairment expense increased 3 million to 355 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 352 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to current year impairments of million and million at AES Brasil and Mong Duong, respectively, after meeting held-for-sale criteria. This was partially offset by prior year impairments of million and million at TEG and TEP, respectively, million associated with the commitment to accelerate the retirement of the Norgener coal-fired plant in Chile, million at Amman East and IPP4 in Jordan due to the delay in closing the sale transaction, and 18 million at five project companies at AES Renewable Holdings associated with the buyout of tax equity partners.

 The Company recognized net foreign currency transaction losses of 28 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by unrealized losses on swaps and options denominated in the Brazilian real and unrealized losses due to the depreciation of the Chilean peso. 
 The Company recognized net foreign currency transaction gains of 2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by unrealized gains on swaps and options denominated in the Brazilian real; partially offset by unrealized losses due to the depreciation of the Chilean peso. 
 The Company recognized net foreign currency transaction losses of 100 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by the depreciation of the Argentine peso and unrealized losses related to an intercompany loan denominated in the Colombian peso. 
 The Company recognized net foreign currency transaction losses of 209 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by the depreciation of the Argentine peso and unrealized losses related to an intercompany loan denominated in the Colombian peso; partially offset by unrealized gains on debt in Brazil. 
 
 Income tax expense 
 Income tax expense decreased 6 million, or 6 , to 103 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 109 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company s effective tax rates were 31 and 26 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This increase in the effective tax rate was impacted by tax expense resulting from allocations of losses to tax equity investors on renewables projects. Partially offsetting these impacts was the current quarter benefit associated with ITCs. 
 Income tax expense decreased 127 million, or 71 , to 52 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 179 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company s effective tax rates were 10 and 26 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This decrease in the effective tax rate was largely due to the current year benefits associated with ITCs, the AES Brasil held-for-sale reclassification, and the restructuring of a foreign holding company. These drivers were partially offset by current year tax expense resulting from allocations of losses to tax equity investors on renewables projects. Further, the prior year effective tax rate was benefited by inflationary and foreign currency impacts at certain Argentine businesses, partially offset by the recognition of valuation allowance against certain Argentine deferred tax assets. 
 See Note 18 Held-for-Sale and Dispositions in Item 1. Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for further information on AES Brasil. 
 Our effective tax rate reflects the tax effect of significant operations outside the U.S., which are generally taxed at rates different than the U.S. statutory rate of 21 . Furthermore, our foreign earnings may be subjected to incremental U.S. taxation under the GILTI rules. A future proportionate change in the composition of income before income taxes from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions could impact our periodic effective tax rate. 
 
 Net equity in losses of affiliates 
 Net equity in losses of affiliates decreased 5 million to 9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 14 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by higher earnings from sPower, primarily due to contributions from new projects that came online. 
 Net equity in losses of affiliates decreased 22 million to 21 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 43 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in losses from Fluence, mainly attributable to improved margins on a new product line, and higher earnings from sPower, primarily due to contributions from new projects that came online, partially offset by a 

47 | The AES Corporation | September 30, 2024 Form 10-Q 

 decrease in earnings from Mesa La Paz, primarily due to the prior year termination of derivative positions due to a contract amendment. 
 See Note 7 Investments in and Advances to Affiliates included in Item 1. Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for further information. 
 
 Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries 
 Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries increased 352 million to a 292 million loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to income of 60 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to: 
 Higher allocation of losses to tax equity investors on renewables projects placed in service; and 
 Held-for-sale impairments at Brazil and Mong Duong. 
 These increases were partially offset by: 
 Selldowns of business interests resulting in larger shares of income attributable to minority shareholders at the Energy Infrastructure SBU; and 
 Better hydrology resulting in higher generation in Panama. 
 Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries increased 788 million to a 670 million loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to income of 118 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to: 
 Higher allocation of losses to tax equity investors on renewables projects placed in service; and 
 Held-for-sale impairments at Brazil and Mong Duong. 
 These increases were partially offset by: 
 Selldowns of business interests resulting in larger shares of income attributable to minority shareholders at the Energy Infrastructure SBU; and 
 Better hydrology resulting in higher generation in Panama. 
 
 Net income (loss) attributable to The AES Corporation 
 Net income attributable to The AES Corporation increased 271 million to 502 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 231 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to: 
 Higher contributions from renewables projects placed in service in the current year; 
 Lower long-lived asset impairments in the current year; and 
 Unrealized foreign currency losses at the Energy Infrastructure SBU in the prior year. 
 These increases were partially offset by: 
 Lower contributions from the Energy Infrastructure SBU primarily due to the end of commercial operations at Warrior Run in the second quarter of 2024 and higher energy margin from our hedged merchant Southland facilities in the prior year that are contracted primarily for capacity in the current year; 
 Lower margins at the Renewables SBU driven by record-breaking drought conditions and partial outage due to a flooding incident in Colombia; and 
 Higher interest expense mainly from new debt at the Renewables and Utilities SBUs. 
 Net income attributable to The AES Corporation increased 776 million to 1,119 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 343 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to: 
 Higher contributions from renewables projects placed in service in the current year; 
 Unrealized foreign currency losses at the Energy Infrastructure SBU in the prior year; 
 Lower long-lived asset impairments in the current year; 
 Higher revenues under a PPA termination agreement in the Energy Infrastructure SBU; 

48 | The AES Corporation | September 30, 2024 Form 10-Q 

 Lower income tax expense; and 
 Higher earnings from the Utilities SBU. 
 These increases were partially offset by: 
 The impact of selldowns, higher energy margin from our hedged merchant Southland facilities in the prior year that are contracted primarily for capacity in the current year, and higher outages at the Energy Infrastructure SBU; 
 Lower margins at the Renewables SBU driven by record-breaking drought conditions and partial outage due to a flooding incident in Colombia; 
 Losses on commencement of sales-type leases at AES Renewable Holdings; and 
 Higher interest expense and lower interest income in the current year. 
 
 SBU Performance Analysis 
 Non-GAAP Measures 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes, Adjusted PTC, and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP supplemental measures that are used by management and external users of our condensed consolidated financial statements such as investors, industry analysts, and lenders. 
 During the first quarter of 2024, the Company updated the definitions of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted PTC, and Adjusted EPS add-back (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions and equity securities to include financial assets and liabilities measured using the fair value option, and updated add-back (e) gains, losses, and costs due to the early retirement of debt to include troubled debt restructuring. We believe excluding these gains or losses better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company. The Company also removed the adjustment for net gains at Angamos, one of our businesses in the Energy Infrastructure SBU, associated with the early contract terminations with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence. As this adjustment was specific to certain contract terminations that occurred in 2020, we believe removing this adjustment from our non-GAAP definitions provides simplification and clarity for our investors. There were no such impacts in 2023 or 2024 to date. 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes 
 We define EBITDA as earnings before interest income and expense, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for the impact of NCI and interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization of our equity affiliates, adding back interest income recognized under service concession arrangements, and excluding gains or losses of both consolidated entities and entities accounted for under the equity method due to (a) unrealized gains or losses pertaining to derivative transactions, equity securities, and financial assets and liabilities measured using the fair value option; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses, benefits and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, and gains and losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases; (d) losses due to impairments; and (e) gains, losses, and costs due to the early retirement of debt or troubled debt restructuring. 
 In addition to the revenue and cost of sales reflected in Operating Margin, Adjusted EBITDA includes the other components of our Consolidated Statement of Operations, such as general and administrative expenses in Corporate and Other as well as business development costs, other expense and other income, realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and net equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates . 
 We further define Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes as Adjusted EBITDA, adding back the pre-tax effect of Production Tax Credits PTCs ), Investment Tax Credits ITCs ), and depreciation tax deductions allocated to tax equity investors, as well as the tax benefit recorded from tax credits retained or transferred to third parties. 
 The GAAP measure most comparable to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes is Net income . We believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes better reflect the underlying business performance of the Company. Adjusted EBITDA is the most relevant measure considered in the Company s internal evaluation of the financial performance of its segments. Factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses pertaining to derivative transactions, equity securities, or financial assets and liabilities remeasurement, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments, strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests or retire debt, and the variability of allocations of earnings to tax equity investors, which affect results in a given period or periods. In addition, each of these metrics represents the business performance of the Company before the application of statutory income tax rates and tax

 adjustments, including the effects of tax planning, corresponding to the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Given its large number of businesses and overall complexity, the Company concluded that Adjusted EBITDA is a more transparent measure than Net income that better assists investors in determining which businesses have the greatest impact on the Company s results. 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes should not be construed as alternatives to Net income , which is determined in accordance with GAAP.

 Operating Margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 43 million. This decrease was primarily driven by record-breaking drought conditions in Colombia. Additionally, a partial outage in Colombia during July 2024, which resulted from a flooding incident at the Chivor plant in the prior month, drier hydrology in Brazil and the depreciation of the Brazilian real further impacted operating margin. These adverse effects were partially offset by higher margins due to better hydrology in Panama, new businesses operating in our portfolio, higher contracted energy sales, and unrealized derivative gains. 
 Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 68 million, primarily due to the drivers mentioned above, adjusted for NCI, unrealized derivatives, and depreciation. 
 Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 389 million, primarily due to higher realized tax attributes driven by more renewables projects placed in service, partially offset by the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we realized 475 million and 18 million, respectively, from tax attributes earned by our U.S. renewables business. 
 Operating Margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 105 million, driven primarily by higher fixed costs due to an accelerated growth plan, record-breaking drought conditions in Colombia, reduced wind and solar availability alongside drier hydrological conditions in Brazil, and higher outages at Colombia due to a flooding incident at the Chivor plant which occurred in June 2024, partially offset by higher margin from new businesses, higher contracted energy sales and unrealized derivatives gains.

 Key Trends and Uncertainties 
 During 2024 and beyond, we expect to face the following challenges at certain of our businesses. Management expects that improved operating performance at certain businesses, growth from new businesses, and global cost reduction initiatives may lessen or offset their impact. If these favorable effects do not occur, or if the challenges described below and elsewhere in this section impact us more significantly than we currently anticipate, or if volatile foreign currencies and commodities move more unfavorably, then these adverse factors (or other adverse factors unknown to us) may have a material impact on our operating margin, net income attributable to The AES Corporation, and cash flows. We continue to monitor our operations and address challenges as they arise. For the risk factors related to our business, see Item 1. Business and Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Operational 
 
 Trade Restrictions and Supply Chain On April 1, 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce Commerce initiated an investigation into whether imports into the U.S. of solar cells and panels imported from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam Southeast Asia are circumventing antidumping and countervailing duty AD/CVD orders on solar cells and panels from China. This investigation resulted in significant systemic disruptions to the import of solar cells and panels from Southeast Asia. On June 6, 2022, President Biden issued a Proclamation waiving any circumvention duties on imported solar cells and panels from Southeast Asia that result from this investigation for a 24-month period ending June 6, 2024. Suppliers resumed importing cells and panels from Southeast Asia into the U.S. pursuant to a Commerce certification regime implementing the Proclamation. 
 On December 2, 2022, Commerce issued country-wide affirmative preliminary determinations that circumvention had occurred in each of the four Southeast Asian countries. Commerce also evaluated numerous individual companies and issued preliminary determinations that circumvention had occurred with respect to several but not all of these companies. Additionally, Commerce issued a preliminary determination that circumvention would not be deemed to occur for any solar cells and panels imported from the four countries if the wafers comprising the cells and panels were manufactured outside of China or if no more than two out of six specifically identified panel components were produced in China. On August 23, 2023, Commerce published its final determinations and affirmed its preliminary findings in most respects. Commerce found that three of the specific companies it investigated were not circumventing. Several parties have challenged Commerce s circumvention final 

56 | The AES Corporation | September 30, 2024 Form 10-Q 

 determinations before the U.S. Court of International Trade CIT ), arguing that the determinations were not supported by substantial evidence or otherwise rendered in accordance with governing law. 
 On December 29, 2023, Auxin Solar and Concept Clean Energy filed a lawsuit before the CIT, challenging certain aspects of the final rule promulgated by Commerce to implement the Proclamation. The lawsuit specifically challenges Commerce s decisions not to suspend the final disposition of certain entries of imported solar cells and panels from Southeast Asia made prior to June 6, 2024, and not to collect AD/CVD deposits with respect to those entries. Certain U.S. developers, associations, and foreign solar producers have intervened in the case to support Commerce s final rule. The CIT denied motions to dismiss filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, and the defendant-intervenors, and on July 22, 2024, plaintiffs filed their opening brief on the merits. 
 On April 24, 2024, new Commerce regulations with respect to the administration of AD/CVD cases went into effect, including regulations pertaining to transnational subsidization and particular market situations. On the same day, several companies filed a petition requesting that Commerce initiate an investigation into whether new AD/CVD duties should be imposed on cells and modules imported from Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Vietnam. These petitions cover exports of cells and panels from Southeast Asia that are not otherwise subject to the Commerce circumvention determinations. On May 14, 2024, Commerce initiated new AD/CVD investigations with respect to all four countries, and the U.S. International Trade Commission (the ITC preliminarily voted to continue its investigations on June 7, 2024. On October 4, 2024, Commerce published its CVD preliminary determinations, establishing CVD cash deposit requirements, which may be applied retroactively with respect to Thailand and Vietnam. Commerce is scheduled to announce its AD preliminary determinations in these investigations in late November of 2024. The ITC will conduct its final injury investigation with respect to these exports from Southeast Asia in the first half of 2025. If the Commerce and ITC investigations result in Commerce issuing AD/CVD orders, the orders are likely to be imposed in the second or third quarter of 2025. 
 Separately, the United States maintains a global tariff (currently 14.25 ad valorem) on solar cells and modules pursuant to the Section 201 Safeguard Action on crystalline silicon photovoltaic products, which became effective in February 2018. On June 21, 2024, President Biden issued Proclamation 10779, revoking the exclusion of bifacial panels from safeguard relief previously proclaimed in Proclamation 10339, and reinstating bifacial panels under the Section 201 Safeguard Action, subject to certain qualifications. 
 Additionally, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act UFLPA seeks to block the import of products made with forced labor in cert ain areas of China, at any point in the supply chain, and may lead to certain suppliers being blocked from importing solar cells and panels to the U.S . While this has impacted the U.S. market, AES has managed this issue without significant impact to our projects. Further disruptions may impact our suppliers ability or willingness to meet their contractual agreements or to continue to supply cells or panels into the U.S. market on terms that we deem satisfactory. 
 The impact of new Commerce investigations or any additional adverse Commerce determinations or other tariff disputes or litigation, the impact of the UFLPA, potential future disruptions to the solar panel supply chain and their effect on AES U.S. solar project development and construction activities remain uncertain. AES will continue to monitor developments and take prudent steps towards maintaining a robust supply chain for our renewables projects. To that end, we have contracted and secured all of the necessary solar panels for our projects in our backlog expected to come online through 2026. We have all the 2024 panels and we expect to have the majority of the 2025 and 2026 panels in the United States by November. 
 Additionally, as part of our supply chain strategy, we are well advanced in securing domestically manufactured modules to support our US solar growth from 2026 to 2028, with a contractual option to extend deliveries to 2030. 
 
 Operational Sensitivity to Dry Hydrological Conditions Our hydroelectric generation facilities are sensitive to changes in the weather, particularly the level of water inflows into generation facilities. Dry hydrological conditions in Panama, Brazil, Colombia, and Chile can present challenges for our businesses in these markets. Low inflows can result in low reservoir levels, reduced generation output, and subsequently possible increased prices for electricity. If our hydroelectric generation facilities cannot generate sufficient energy to meet contractual arrangements, we may need to purchase energy to fulfill our obligations, which could have an adverse impact on AES. As mitigation, AES has invested in thermal, wind, and solar generation assets, which have a complementary profile to hydroelectric plants. These plants are expected to have increased generation in low hydrology scenarios, offsetting possible impacts described from hydro assets. 
 According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ("NOAA"), neutral conditions are currently observed. La Ni a is emerging and expected to continue to emerge through November (60 chance) and is expected to persist through January-March 2025. 

57 | The AES Corporation | September 30, 2024 Form 10-Q 

 In Panama, La Ni a phenomenon in contrast to El Ni o typically results in wetter conditions than average, although local system impacts may vary due to other factors. Higher hydrology may result in energy surpluses after covering the contracted hydro positions, available to be sold in the spot market after fulfilling contract obligations. 
 In Colombia, La Ni a is typically characterized by more rainfall, possibly leading to a decrease in spot prices. However, during La Ni a, impacts vary and the basin where Chivor is located may experience drier conditions than the system. Inflows at our Chivor hydroelectric plant have been below historical averages in the third quarter of 2024. Although conditions are currently expected to return to normal levels in the fourth quarter, should dry conditions persist, Chivor may be exposed to higher spot prices. 
 In Brazil, La Ni a results in more rainfall in the north, drier conditions in the south, and milder temperatures in the central region. Current system reservoir levels remain high, supporting lower spot market prices. However, inflows lower than expected may cause spot and future prices to rise. Lower prices limit external thermal generation which, if dispatched, could impact demand for the AES hydro generation. 
 In Chile, the primary driver for AES hydro assets is snowpack volumes. La Ni a in Chile tends to divert the frontal systems to the south of Chile, reducing rainfall in the central area, possibly reducing the snowpack formation. Lower snowpack, together with reduced rainfall in the system, could increase both spot prices and energy purchase volumes required to meet contracted positions. 
 The exact behavior pattern and strength of La Ni a is unknown and therefore the impacts could vary from those described above, and may include impacts to our businesses beyond hydrology, including with respect to power generation from other renewable sources of energy and demand. Even if rainfall and water inflows return to historical averages, in some cases market prices and generation above or below the average could persist until reservoir levels are fully recovered. Further, investments made in thermal, wind, and solar power generation may benefit from uncontracted spot sales at higher market prices. Impacts may be material to our results of operations. 
 
 Macroeconomic and Political 
 During the past few years, some countries where our subsidiaries conduct business have experienced macroeconomic and political changes. In the event these trends continue, there could be an adverse impact on our businesses. 
 
 Inflation Reduction Act and U.S. Renewable Energy Tax Credits The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA includes provisions that benefit the U.S. clean energy industry, including increases, extensions, direct transfers, and/or new tax credits for onshore and offshore wind, solar, storage, and hydrogen projects. The IRA extends solar investment tax credits ("ITCs") and provides higher credits for projects that satisfy wage and apprenticeship requirements, which benefit our U.S. renewables business. 
 Our U.S. renewables business has a 51 GW pipeline that we intend to utilize to continue to grow our business, and these changes in tax policy are supportive of this strategy. We account for U.S. renewables projects according to U.S. GAAP, which, when partnering with tax-equity investors to monetize tax benefits, utilizes the HLBV method. This method recognizes the tax-credit value that is transferred to tax equity investors at the time of its creation, which for projects utilizing the investment tax credit begins in the quarter the project is placed in service. For projects utilizing the production tax credit, this value is recognized over 10 years as the facility produces energy. 
 The IRA also allows us to directly transfer investment tax credits to unrelated tax credit buyers. We account for the transfer proceeds as tax benefit throughout the year the renewables project is placed in service. 
 In 2023, we realized 611 million of earnings from tax attributes, comprised of 593 million from the Renewables SBU and 18 million from the Utilities SBU. In 2024, we expect an increase in tax attributes earned by our U.S. renewables business in line with the growth in that business. Based on construction schedules, a significant portion of these earnings will be realized in the fourth quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 895 million in tax attributes. 
 The implementation of the IRA requires substantial guidance from the U.S. Department of Treasury and other government agencies. While some of that guidance remains pending, there will be uncertainty with respect to the implementation of certain provisions of the IRA. 
 
 Argentina President Javier Milei was elected on December 10, 2023 and has instituted a series of reforms impacting the power sector. 
 On July 8, 2024, the Argentine government enacted Law 27,742 or Ley Bases, translated in English as Law of Bases and Starting Points for the Freedom of the Argentine People. Ley Bases declares a public emergency in 

58 | The AES Corporation | September 30, 2024 Form 10-Q 

 administrative, economic, financial, and energy matters for a term of one year, grants delegated powers to the President, and contains a broad reform of the State in order to deregulate the economy, including measures such as labor reform, the implementation of the Incentive Regime for Large Investments, and the modification of several non-income tax measures. The law also opens avenues for privatization of state-owned energy companies. 
 In addition, the Ministry of Energy published Resolution 150/2024 on July 10, 2024 that repeals certain regulations from previous years that imply excessive involvement of the National State and CAMMESA in the operation and functioning of the wholesale electricity market. 
 These changes may have a profound impact on the sector, influencing our operations and financial results. It is not yet possible to predict the impact of these regulations in our consolidated results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. 
 
 Global Tax The macroeconomic and political environments in the U.S. and in some countries where our subsidiaries conduct business have changed in recent years. This could result in significant impacts to future tax law. In the U.S., the IRA includes a 15 corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) based on adjusted financial statement income. In September 2024, the IRS released proposed regulations on the 15 CAMT. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impacts of these regulations. 
 During 2023, the Netherlands, Bulgaria, and Vietnam adopted legislation to implement Pillar 2 effective as of January 1, 2024. We will continue to monitor the issuance of draft legislation in other non-EU countries where the Company operates that are considering Pillar 2 amendments and new interpretive guidance. The impact to the Company during 2024 is not expected to be material. 
 
 Inflation In the markets in which we operate, there have been higher rates of inflation recently. While most of our contracts in our international businesses that are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar are indexed to inflation, in general, our U.S.-based generation contracts are not indexed to inflation. If inflation continues to increase in our markets, it may increase our expenses that we may not be able to pass through to customers. It may also increase the costs of some of our development projects that could negatively impact their competitiveness. Our utility businesses do allow for recovering of operations and maintenance costs through the regulatory process, which may have timing impacts on recovery. 
 
 Interest Rates In the U.S. and other markets in which we operate, there has been a rise in interest rates since 2021, and interest rates are expected to remain volatile in the near term. 
 As discussed in Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, although most of our existing corporate and subsidiary debt is at fixed rates, an increase in interest rates can have several impacts on our business. For any existing debt under floating rate structures and any future debt refinancings, rising interest rates will increase future financing costs. In most cases in which we have floating rate debt, our revenues serving this debt are indexed to inflation, which helps mitigate the impact of rising rates. For future debt refinancings, AES actively manages a hedging program to reduce uncertainty and exposure to future interest rates. For new business, higher interest rates increase the financing costs for new projects under development and which have not yet secured financing. 
 AES typically seeks to incorporate expected financing costs into our new PPA pricing such that we maintain our target investment returns, but higher financing costs may negatively impact our returns or the competitiveness of some of our development projects. Additionally, we typically seek to enter into interest rate hedges shortly after signing PPAs to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates prior to securing long-term financing. 
 
 Puerto Rico As discussed in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Key Trends and Uncertainties of the 2023 Form 10-K, our subsidiaries in Puerto Rico have long-term PPAs with state-owned PREPA, which has been facing economic challenges that could result in a material adverse effect on our business in Puerto Rico. Despite the Title III protection, PREPA has been making substantially all of its payments to the generators in line with historical payment patterns. 
 The Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act PROMESA was enacted to create a structure for exercising federal oversight over the fiscal affairs of U.S. territories and created procedures for adjusting debt accumulated by the Puerto Rico government and, potentially, other territories Title III ). PROMESA also expedites the approval of key energy projects and other critical projects in Puerto Rico. 
 PROMESA allowed for the establishment of an Oversight Board with broad powers of budgetary and financial control over Puerto Rico. The Oversight Board filed for bankruptcy on behalf of PREPA under Title III in July 2017. 

59 | The AES Corporation | September 30, 2024 Form 10-Q 

 As a result of the bankruptcy filing, AES Ilumina s non-recourse debt of 23 million continues to be in technical default and is classified as current as of September 30, 2024. 
 In 2022, a mediation commenced to resolve the PREPA Title III case. The confirmation trial ended in March 2024 and the decision is pending. 
 Considering the information available as of the date hereof, management believes the carrying amount of our long-lived assets in Puerto Rico of 384 million is recoverable as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Decarbonization Initiatives 
 Our strategy involves shifting towards clean energy platforms, including renewable energy, energy storage, LNG, and modernized grids. It is designed to position us for continued growth while reducing our carbon intensity and to be in support of our mission of accelerating the future of energy, together. We have made significant progress on our exit of coal generation, and we intend to exit the substantial majority of our remaining coal facilities by year-end 2025 and intend to exit all of the coal facilities by year-end 2027, subject to necessary approvals. 
 In addition, initiatives have been announced by regulators, including in Chile, Puerto Rico, Bulgaria, and offtakers in recent years, with the intention of reducing GHG emissions generated by the energy industry. In parallel, the shift towards renewables has caused certain customers to migrate to other low-carbon energy solutions and this trend may continue. 
 Although we cannot currently estimate the financial impact of these decarbonization initiatives, new legislative or regulatory programs further restricting carbon emissions or other initiatives to voluntarily exit coal generation could require material capital expenditures, result in a reduction of the estimated useful life of certain coal facilities, or have other material adverse effects on our financial results. 
 For further information about the risks associated with decarbonization initiatives, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Concerns about GHG emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change have led to increased regulation and other actions that could impact our businesses included in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Regulatory 
 AES Maritza PPA Review DG Comp is conducting a preliminary review of whether AES Maritza s PPA with NEK is compliant with the European Union's State Aid rules. No formal investigation has been launched by DG Comp to date. AES Maritza has previously engaged in discussions with the DG Comp case team and the Government of Bulgaria GoB to attempt to reach a negotiated resolution of the DG Comp s review PPA Discussions ). There are no active PPA Discussions at present but those discussions could resume at any time. The PPA continues to remain in place. However, there can be no assurance that, in the context of DG Comp s preliminary review or any future PPA Discussions, the other parties will not seek a prompt termination of the PPA. 
 We do not believe termination of the PPA is justified. Nevertheless, the PPA Discussions involved a range of potential outcomes, including but not limited to the termination of the PPA and payment of some level of compensation to AES Maritza. Any negotiated resolution would be subject to mutually acceptable terms, lender consent, and DG Comp approval. At this time, we cannot predict whether and when the PPA Discussions might resume or the outcome of any such discussions. Nor can we predict how DG Comp might resolve its review if the PPA Discussions do not resume or if any such discussions fail to result in an agreement concerning the agency's review. AES Maritza believes that its PPA is legal and in compliance with all applicable laws, and it will take all actions necessary to protect its interests, whether through negotiated agreement or otherwise. However, there can be no assurance that this matter will be resolved favorably; if it is not, there could be a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. As of September 30, 2024, the carrying value of our long-lived assets at Maritza is 336 million. 
 AES Indiana DSM Plan Petition On May 31, 2024, AES Indiana filed a petition with the IURC asking for approval of a two year Demand-Side Management (DSM) plan for the 2025-2026 program years. The petition includes requested cost recovery of programs as well as performance incentives, depending on the level of success of the programs consistent with prior DSM plans. On October 1, 2024, AES Indiana and the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor OUCC filed settlement testimony with the IURC in support of approval of a Stipulation and Settlement Agreement reached between the settling parties (AES Indiana, OUCC, and Citizens Action Coalition). An evidentiary hearing on this matter was held by the IURC on October 22, 2024. We expect the IURC to issue an order on this proceeding by the end of 2024. 

60 | The AES Corporation | September 30, 2024 Form 10-Q 

 AES Indiana Regulatory Rate Review On April 17, 2024, the IURC issued an order (the 2024 Rate Order approving the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement that AES Indiana entered into on November 22, 2023, with the OUCC and the other intervening parties in AES Indiana s base rate case filing. Among other matters and consistent with the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement, the 2024 Rate Order approves an increase in AES Indiana's total annual operating revenue of 71 million for AES Indiana s electric service and provides a return on common equity of 9.9 and cost of long-term debt of 4.90 on a rate base of approximately 3.5 billion. Updated customer rates and charges became effective on May 9, 2024. 
 AES Indiana Petersburg Repowering On March 11, 2024, AES Indiana filed for approval of a CPCN seeking for IURC approval to repower Petersburg Generation Units 3 4 from coal to natural gas and to recover costs through future rates. The conversion of Unit 3 is expected to begin in February 2026 and be completed by June 2026 and the conversion of Unit 4 is expected to begin in June 2026 and be completed by December 2026. An evidentiary hearing on this matter was held by the IURC on August 6, 2024, and we expect the IURC to issue an order on this proceeding during the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 AES Ohio Smart Grid Phase 2 Filing In February 2024, AES Ohio filed a Smart Grid Phase 2 with the PUCO proposing to invest approximately 683 million in capital projects over a 10-year period following Smart Grid Phase 1, which ends June 2025. On September 13, 2024, AES Ohio reached a settlement with the PUCO Staff and other parties to resolve the pending Smart Grid Phase 2 Application. The Settlement will provide for a four-year plan to invest 241 million of capital and 19 million of operations and maintenance expense related to grid modernization, support of Distributed Energy Resources and Economic Development and an enhanced Telecommunications network. These costs will be recovered through the existing Investment Infrastructure Rider. 
 If approved, AES Ohio will implement a comprehensive grid modernization project that will deliver benefits to customers, society as a whole and to AES Ohio. An evidentiary hearing was held on October 29, 2024, and we expect an order from PUCO by the second quarter of 2025, prior to the end of Smart Grid Phase 1. 
 AES Ohio Distribution Rate Case On October 30, 2024, AES Ohio filed a Pre-filing Notice of Intent to file an application to increase rates for distribution service. The Distribution Rate Case Application will be filed on November 29, 2024. 
 
 Foreign Exchange Rates 
 We operate in multiple countries and as such are subject to volatility in exchange rates at varying degrees at the subsidiary level and between our functional currency, the USD, and currencies of the countries in which we operate. 
 The overall economic climate in Argentina has deteriorated, resulting in volatility and increased the risk that a further significant devaluation of the Argentine peso against the USD, similar to the devaluations experienced by the country in 2018, 2019, and 2023, may occur. A continued trend of peso devaluation could result in increased inflation, a deterioration of the country s risk profile, and other adverse macroeconomic effects that could significantly impact our results of operations. For additional information, refer to Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk . 
 
 Impairments and Realizability 
 Long-lived Assets and Current Assets Held-for-Sale During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized asset impairment expense of 355 million. See Note 16 Asset Impairment Expense included in Item 1. Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for further information. After recognizing this impairment expense, the carrying value of long-lived assets and current assets held-for-sale that were assessed for impairment totaled 2.5 billion at September 30, 2024. 
 Events or changes in circumstances that may necessitate recoverability tests and potential impairments of long-lived assets may include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, unfavorable changes in power prices or fuel costs, increased competition due to additional capacity in the grid, technological advancements, declining trends in demand, evolving industry expectations to transition away from fossil fuel sources for generation, or an expectation it is more likely than not the asset will be disposed of before the end of its estimated useful life. 

61 | The AES Corporation | September 30, 2024 Form 10-Q 

 Tax Asset Realizability Certain AES Chilean businesses have recorded net deferred tax assets ("DTA") of 235 million relating primarily to net operating loss carryforwards, which are not subject to expiration. Their realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income. At this time, management believes it is more likely than not that all of the DTA will be realized; however, it could be reduced by way of valuation allowance in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced. 
 
 Environmental 
 The Company is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates. The Company faces certain risks and uncertainties related to these environmental laws and regulations, including existing and potential GHG legislation or regulations, and actual or potential laws and regulations pertaining to water discharges, waste management (including disposal of coal combustion residuals) and certain air emissions, such as SO 2 , NO x , particulate matter, mercury, and other hazardous air pollutants, and species and habitat protections. Such risks and uncertainties could result in increased capital expenditures or other compliance costs which could have a material adverse effect on certain of our U.S. or international subsidiaries and our consolidated results of operations. For further information about these risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Our operations are subject to significant government regulation and could be adversely affected by changes in the law or regulatory schemes; Several of our businesses are subject to potentially significant remediation expenses, enforcement initiatives, private party lawsuits and reputational risk associated with CCR; Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws, rules and regulations; and Concerns about GHG emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change have led to increased regulation and other actions that could impact our businesses included in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 CSAPR CSAPR addresses the good neighbor provision of the CAA, which prohibits sources within each state from emitting any air pollutant in an amount which will contribute significantly to any other state s nonattainment, or interference with maintenance of, any NAAQS. The CSAPR required significant reductions in SO 2 and NO x emissions from power plants in many states in which subsidiaries of the Company operate. The Company is required to comply with the CSAPR in certain states, including Indiana and Maryland. The CSAPR is implemented, in part, through a market-based program under which compliance may be achievable through the acquisition and use of emissions allowances created by the EPA. The Company complies with CSAPR through operation of existing controls and purchases of allowances on the open market, as needed. 
 In October 2016, the EPA published a final rule to update the CSAPR to address the 2008 ozone NAAQS CSAPR Update Rule ). The CSAPR Update Rule found that NO x ozone season emissions in 22 states (including Indiana and Maryland) affected the ability of downwind states to attain and maintain the 2008 ozone NAAQS, and, accordingly, the EPA issued federal implementation plans that both updated existing CSAPR NO x ozone season emission budgets for electric generating units within these states and implemented these budgets through modifications to the CSAPR NO x ozone season allowance trading program. Implementation started in the 2017 ozone season (May-September 2017). Affected facilities receive fewer ozone season NO x allowances in 2017 and later, possibly resulting in the need to purchase additional allowances. Following legal challenges to the CSAPR Update Rule, on April 30, 2021, the EPA issued the Revised CSAPR Update Rule. The Revised CSAPR Update Rule required affected EGUs within certain states (including Indiana and Maryland) to participate in a new trading program, the CSAPR NO x Ozone Season Group 3 trading program. These affected EGUs received fewer NO x Ozone Season allowances beginning in 2021. 
 On June 5, 2023, the EPA published a final Federal Implementation Plan to address air quality impacts with respect to the 2015 Ozone NAAQS. The rule establishes a revised CSAPR NO x Ozone Season Group 3 trading program for 22 states, including Indiana and Maryland, and became effective during 2023. The FIP also includes enhancements to the revised Group 3 trading program, which include a dynamic budget setting process beginning in 2026, annual recalibration of the allowance bank to reflect changes to affected sources, a daily backstop emissions rate limit for certain coal-fired electric generating units beginning in 2024, and a secondary emissions limit prohibiting certain emissions associated with state assurance levels. It is too early to determine the impact of the final FIP, but it may result in the need to purchase additional allowances or make operational adjustments. On June 27, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an order granting a stay of the EPA s 2023 Federal Implementation Plan ("FIP") pending resolution of legal challenges to the FIP. 
 While the Company's additional CSAPR compliance costs to date have been immaterial, the future availability of and cost to purchase allowances to meet the emission reduction requirements is uncertain at this time, but it could be material.

 Mercury and Air Toxics Standard In April 2012, the EPA s rule to establish maximum achievable control technology standards for hazardous air pollutants regulated under the CAA emitted from coal and oil-fired electric utilities, known as MATS , became effective and AES facilities implemented measures to comply, as applicable. In June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court remanded MATS to the D.C. Circuit due to the EPA s failure to consider costs before deciding to regulate power plants under Section 112 of the CAA and subsequently remanded MATS to the EPA without vacatur. On May 22, 2020, the EPA published a final finding that it is not appropriate and necessary to regulate hazardous air pollutant emissions from coal- and oil-fired electric generating units EGUs (reversing its prior 2016 finding), but that the EPA would not remove the source category from the CAA Section 112(c) list of source categories and would not change the MATS requirements. On March 6, 2023, the EPA published a final rule to revoke its May 2020 finding and reaffirm its 2016 finding that it is appropriate and necessary to regulate these emissions. On April 24, 2023, the EPA published a proposed rule, the MATS Risk and Technology Review RTR Rule to lower certain emissions limits and revise certain other aspects of MATS. On May 7, 2024, the EPA published a final rule to revise MATS for coal and oil-fired EGUs. The final rule became effective on July 8, 2024. The final rule lowers certain emissions limits and revises certain other aspects of MATS. The MATS RTR Rule is subject to legal challenges. On October 4, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court denied emergency stay applications. 
 Further rulemakings and/or proceedings are possible; however, in the meantime, MATS remains in effect. We currently cannot predict the outcome of the regulatory or judicial process, or its impact, if any, on our MATS compliance planning or ultimate costs. 
 Climate Change Regulation The final NSPS for CO 2 emissions from new, modified, and reconstructed fossil-fuel-fired power plants were published in the Federal Register on October 23, 2015. Several states and industry groups challenged the NSPS for CO 2 in the D.C. Circuit Court. On December 20, 2018, the EPA published proposed revisions to the final NSPS for new, modified, and reconstructed coal-fired electric utility steam generating units. The EPA proposed that the Best System of Emissions Reduction BSER for these units is highly efficient generation that would be equivalent to supercritical steam conditions for larger units and sub-critical steam conditions for smaller units, and not partial carbon capture and sequestration CCS ), which had been the BSER for these units in the 2015 final NSPS. The EPA did not include revisions for natural-gas combined cycle or simple cycle units in the December 20, 2018 proposal. Challenges to the GHG NSPS remain held in abeyance at this time. On May 23, 2023, the EPA published a proposed rule that would establish CO 2 emissions limits for certain new fossil-fuel fired stationary combustion turbines that commence construction or are modified after May 23, 2023. On May 9, 2024, the EPA published the final NSPS requiring carbon capture and sequestration for new and reconstructed baseload stationary combustion turbines, among other requirements. The EPA did not finalize revisions to the NSPS for newly constructed or reconstructed coal-fired electric utility steam generating units as proposed in 2018. 
 On July 8, 2019, the EPA published the final Affordable Clean Energy ACE Rule which would have established CO 2 emission rules for existing power plants under CAA Section 111(d) and would have replaced the EPA's 2015 Clean Power Plan Rule CPP ). However, on January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit vacated and remanded the ACE Rule. Subsequently, on June 30, 2022, the Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the D.C. Circuit Court and remanded for further proceedings consistent with its opinion holding that the generation shifting approach in the CPP exceeded the authority granted to the EPA by Congress under Section 111(d) of the CAA. As a result of the June 30, 2022 Supreme Court decision, on October 27, 2022, the D.C. Circuit issued a partial mandate, holding pending challenges to the ACE Rule in abeyance while the EPA developed a replacement rule. On May 23, 2023, the EPA published a proposed rule that would vacate the ACE Rule and proposed New Source Performance Standards NSPSs that would establish emissions guidelines in the form of CO 2 emissions limitations for certain existing electric generating units EGUs and would require states to develop State Plans that establish standards of performance for such EGUs that are at least as stringent as the EPA s emissions guidelines. Depending on various EGU-specific factors, the bases of proposed emissions guidelines range from routine methods of operation to carbon capture and sequestration or co-firing low-GHG hydrogen starting in the 2030s. On May 9, 2024, the EPA published the final rule regulating GHGs from existing EGUs pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act and effective on July 8, 2024. Existing EGUs are those that were constructed prior to January 8, 2014. Depending on various EGU-specific factors, the bases of emissions guidelines for natural gas-fired units include the use of uniform fuels and routine methods of operation and maintenance and the bases of emissions guidelines for coal-fired units include 40 natural gas co-firing or carbon capture and sequestration with 90 capture of CO 2 depending on the date that coal operations cease. Specific standards for performance for EGUs will be established through a State Plan (or a Federal Plan if a state were to not submit an approvable plan). The May 2024 rule is subject to legal challenges. On October 16, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court denied emergency stay applications. The impact of the rules, the results of further proceedings, and potential future greenhouse gas emissions regulations remain uncertain but could be material. 

63 | The AES Corporation | September 30, 2024 Form 10-Q 

 Waste Management On October 19, 2015, an EPA rule regulating CCR under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act as nonhazardous solid waste became effective. The rule established nationally applicable minimum criteria for the disposal of CCR in new and currently operating landfills and surface impoundments, including location restrictions, design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring, corrective action and closure requirements, and post-closure care. The primary enforcement mechanisms under this regulation would be actions commenced by the states and private lawsuits. On December 16, 2016, the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act ("WIN Act") was signed into law. This includes provisions to implement the CCR rule through a state permitting program, or if the state chooses not to participate, a possible federal permit program. If this rule is finalized before Indiana or Puerto Rico establishes a state-level CCR permit program, AES CCR units in those locations could eventually be required to apply for a federal CCR permit from the EPA. The EPA has indicated that it will implement a phased approach to amending the CCR Rule, which is ongoing. On August 28, 2020, the EPA published final amendments to the CCR Rule titled "A Holistic Approach to Closure Part A: Deadline to Initiate Closure," that, among other amendments, required certain CCR units to cease waste receipt and initiate closure by April 11, 2021. The CCR Part A Rule also allowed for extensions of the April 11, 2021 deadline if the EPA determines certain criteria are met. Facilities seeking such an extension were required to submit a demonstration to the EPA by November 30, 2020. On January 11, 2022, the EPA released the first in a series of proposed determinations regarding CCR Part A Rule demonstrations and compliance-related letters notifying certain other facilities of their compliance obligations under the federal CCR regulations. The determinations and letters include interpretations regarding implementation of the CCR Rule. On April 8, 2022, petitions for review were filed challenging these EPA actions. The petitions are consolidated in Electric Energy, Inc. v. EPA. On June 28, 2024, the D.C. Circuit dismissed the challenges. It is too early to determine the direct or indirect impact of these letters or any determinations that may be made. 
 On May 18, 2023, the EPA published a proposed rule that would expand the scope of CCR units regulated by the CCR Rule to include inactive surface impoundments at inactive generating facilities as well as additional inactive and closed landfills and certain other accumulations of CCR. On May 8, 2024, the EPA published final revisions to the CCR rule which are effective on November 8, 2024. The final revisions expand the scope of CCR units regulated by the CCR rule to include legacy surface impoundments, inactive surface impoundments, and CCR management units. It is too early to determine the potential impact. 
 On February 20, 2020, the EPA published a proposed rule to establish a federal CCR permit program that would operate in states without approved CCR permit programs. If this rule is finalized before Indiana establishes a final state-level CCR permit program, AES Indiana could eventually be required to apply for a federal CCR permit from the EPA. On December 21, 2022, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management IDEM published in the Indiana Register a Second Notice of Comment Period for its proposed CCR rulemaking which would include regulation of CCR through a state permitting program. On August 7, 2024, in response to changes to Indiana statute, as well as comments received during the Second Notice of Comment Period, IDEM published a Continuation of the Second Notice of Comment Period for proposed amendments to the draft rule language for a State CCR Permitting Program. 
 The CCR rule, current or proposed amendments to or interpretations of the CCR rule, the results of groundwater monitoring data, or the outcome of CCR-related litigation could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. AES Indiana would seek recovery of any resulting expenditures; however, there is no guarantee we would be successful in this regard. 
 Cooling Water Intake The Company's facilities are subject to a variety of rules governing water use and discharge. In particular, the Company's U.S. facilities are subject to the CWA Section 316(b) rule issued by the EPA effective in 2014 that seeks to protect fish and other aquatic organisms drawn into cooling water systems at power plants and other facilities. These standards require affected facilities to choose among seven BTA options to reduce fish impingement. In addition, certain facilities must conduct studies to assist permitting authorities to determine whether and what site-specific controls, if any, would be required to reduce entrainment of aquatic organisms. It is possible that this process, which includes permitting and public input, could result in the need to install closed-cycle cooling systems (closed-cycle cooling towers) or other technology. Finally, the standards require that new units added to an existing facility to increase generation capacity are required to reduce both impingement and entrainment. It is not yet possible to predict the total impacts of this final rule at this time, including any challenges to such final rule and the outcome of any such challenges. However, if additional capital expenditures are necessary, they could be material. 
 Certain AES Southland OTC units were required to be retired to provide interconnection capacity and/or emissions credits prior to startup of new (air cooled) generating units, and the remaining AES OTC generating units in California have been or will be shut down and permanently retired by the applicable OTC Policy compliance dates 

64 | The AES Corporation | September 30, 2024 Form 10-Q 

 for the respective units. The SWRCB OTC Policy currently requires the shutdown and permanent retirement of the remaining OTC generating units at AES Huntington Beach, LLC and AES Alamitos, LLC by December 31, 2026, as extended in support of grid reliability. This extension compliance date is contingent upon the facilities participating in the Strategic Reserve established by AB 205. 
 Power plants are required to comply with the more stringent of state or federal requirements. At present, the California state requirements are more stringent and have earlier compliance dates than the federal EPA requirements, and are therefore applicable to the Company's California assets. The Company anticipates that compliance with CWA Section 316(b) regulations and associated costs could have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 
 Water Discharges In June 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ("the Agencies") published a rule defining federal jurisdiction over waters of the U.S., known as the "Waters of the U.S." WOTUS rule. WOTUS defines the geographic reach and authority of the Agencies to regulate streams, wetlands, and other water bodies under the CWA. There have been multiple Supreme Court decisions and dueling regulatory definitions over the past several years concerning the proper standard for how to properly determine whether a wetland or stream that is not navigable is considered a WOTUS. On May 25, 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court rendered a decision Decision in the case of Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency , addressing the definition of WOTUS with regards to the CWA. This decision provides a clear standard that substantially restricts the Agencies' ability to regulate certain types of wetlands and streams. Specifically, under this decision, wetlands that do not have a continuous surface connection with traditional interstate navigable water are not federally jurisdictional. 
 On September 8, 2023, the Agencies published final rule amendments in the Federal Register to amend the final Revised Definition of Waters of the United States rule. This final rule conforms the definition to the definition adopted in the Decision. The Agencies have amended key aspects of the regulatory text to conform the rule to the Decision. It is too early to determine whether the outcome of litigation or current or future revisions to rules interpreting federal jurisdiction over WOTUS may have a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 In November 2015, the EPA published its final ELG rule to reduce toxic pollutants discharged into waters of the U.S. by steam-electric power plants through technology applications. These effluent limitations for existing and new sources include dry handling of fly ash, closed-loop or dry handling of bottom ash, and more stringent effluent limitations for flue gas desulfurization wastewater. AES Indiana Petersburg has installed a dry bottom ash handling system in response to the CCR rule and wastewater treatment systems in response to the NPDES permits in advance of the ELG compliance date. Other U.S. businesses already include dry handling of fly ash and bottom ash and do not generate flue gas desulfurization wastewater. Following the 2019 U.S. Court of Appeals vacatur and remand of portions of the 2015 ELG rule related to leachate and legacy water, on March 29, 2023, the EPA published a proposed rule revising the 2020 Reconsideration Rule. On May 9, 2024, the EPA published a final rule which became effective on July 8, 2024. The final rule established more stringent best available technology limits for flue gas desulfurization wastewater, bottom ash transport water, and combustion residual leachate and established a new set of definitions and new limits for combustion residual leachate and legacy wastewater. The May 2024 rule is subject to legal challenges. On October 10, 2024, the Eighth Circuit Court denied stay applications. It is too early to determine whether any outcome of litigation or current or future revisions to the ELG rule might have a material impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
 Capital Resources and Liquidity 
 Overview 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 1.9 billion, of which 6 million was held at the Parent Company and qualified holding companies. The Company had 62 million in short-term investments, held primarily at subsidiaries, and restricted cash and debt service reserves of 640 million. The Company also had non-recourse and recourse aggregate principal amounts of debt outstanding of 22.5 billion and 6.5 billion, respectively. Of the 3.2 billion of our current non-recourse debt, 2.9 billion was presented as such because it is due in the next twelve months and 330 million relates to debt considered in default. AES Puerto Rico is in payment default. See Note 8 Debt in Item 1. Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for additional detail. All other defaults are not payment defaults but are instead technical defaults triggered by failure to comply with covenants or other requirements contained in the non-recourse debt documents. As of September 30, 2024, the Company also had 698 million outstanding related to supplier financing arrangements, which are classified as Supplier financing arrangements on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

65 | The AES Corporation | September 30, 2024 Form 10-Q 

 We expect current maturities of non-recourse debt, recourse debt, and amounts due under supplier financing arrangements to be repaid from net cash provided by operating activities of the subsidiary to which the liability relates, through opportunistic refinancing activity, or some combination thereof. We have 1.7 billion in recourse debt which matures within the next twelve months, including 611 million in outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program. Furthermore, we have 447 million due under supplier financing arrangements that have a Parent Company guarantee. From time to time, we may elect to repurchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise when management believes that such securities are attractively priced. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, and other factors. The amounts involved in any such repurchases may be material. 
 We rely mainly on long-term debt obligations to fund our construction activities. We have, to the extent available at acceptable terms, utilized non-recourse debt to fund a significant portion of the capital expenditures and investments required to construct and acquire our electric power plants, distribution companies, and related assets. Our non-recourse financing is designed to limit cross-default risk to the Parent Company or other subsidiaries and affiliates. Our non-recourse long-term debt is a combination of fixed and variable interest rate instruments. Debt is typically denominated in the currency that matches the currency of the revenue expected to be generated from the benefiting project, thereby reducing currency risk. In certain cases, the currency is matched through the use of derivative instruments. The majority of our non-recourse debt is funded by international commercial banks, with debt capacity supplemented by multilaterals and local regional banks. 
 Given our long-term debt obligations, the Company is subject to interest rate risk on debt balances that accrue interest at variable rates. When possible, the Company will borrow funds at fixed interest rates or hedge its variable rate debt to fix its interest costs on such obligations. In addition, the Company has historically tried to maintain at least 70 of its consolidated long-term obligations at fixed interest rates, including fixing the interest rate through the use of interest rate swaps. These efforts apply to the notional amount of the swaps compared to the amount of related underlying debt. Presently, the Parent Company s only material unhedged exposure to variable interest rate debt relates to 200 million in senior unsecured term loans. Additionally, commercial paper issuances are short-term in nature and subject the Parent Company to interest rate risk at the time of refinancing the paper. On a consolidated basis, of the Company s 29.3 billion of total gross debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024, approximately 9.1 billion accrues interest at variable rates. The Company actively hedges its current and expected variable rate exposure through a combination of currently effective and forward starting interest rate swaps. As of September 30, 2024, the total maximum outstanding amount of hedges protecting the company against variable rate exposure was 8.9 billion. These hedges generally provide economic protection through the entire expected life of the projects, regardless of the type of debt issued to finance construction or refinance the projects in the future. In addition, AES Brasil holds 2.3 billion of floating rate non-recourse debt, which is classified in Current held-for-sale liabilities and Noncurrent held-for-sale liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024, as variable rate instruments act as a natural hedge against inflation in Brazil. 
 In addition to utilizing non-recourse debt at a subsidiary level when available, the Parent Company provides a portion, or in certain instances all, of the remaining long-term financing or credit required to fund development, construction, or acquisition of a particular project. These investments have generally taken the form of equity investments or intercompany loans, which are subordinated to the project s non-recourse loans. We generally obtain the funds for these investments from our cash flows from operations, proceeds from the sales of assets and/or the proceeds from our issuances of debt, common stock, and other securities. Similarly, in certain of our businesses, the Parent Company may provide financial guarantees or other credit support for the benefit of counterparties who have entered into contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity, equipment, or other services with our subsidiaries or lenders. In such circumstances, if a business defaults on its payment or supply obligation, the Parent Company will be responsible for the business obligations up to the amount provided for in the relevant guarantee or other credit support. As of September 30, 2024, the Parent Company had provided outstanding financial and performance-related guarantees or other credit support commitments to or for the benefit of our businesses, which were limited by the terms of the agreements, of approximately 4.3 billion in aggregate (excluding those collateralized by letters of credit and other obligations discussed below). 
 Some counterparties may be unwilling to accept our general unsecured commitments to provide credit support. Accordingly, with respect to both new and existing commitments, the Parent Company may be required to provide some other form of assurance, such as a letter of credit, to backstop or replace our credit support. The Parent Company may not be able to provide adequate assurances to such counterparties. To the extent we are required and able to provide letters of credit or other collateral to such counterparties, this will reduce the amount of credit available to us to meet our other liquidity needs. As of September 30, 2024, we had 237 million in letters of credit outstanding provided under our unsecured credit facilities, 290 million in letters of credit under bilateral agreements, and 24 million in letters of credit outstanding provided under our revolving credit facility. These letters 

66 | The AES Corporation | September 30, 2024 Form 10-Q 

 of credit operate to guarantee performance relating to certain project development and construction activities and business operations. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company paid letter of credit fees ranging from 1 to 3 per annum on the outstanding amounts. 
 Additionally, in connection with certain project financings, some of the Company's subsidiaries have expressly undertaken limited obligations and commitments. These contingent contractual obligations are issued at the subsidiary level and are non-recourse to the Parent Company. As of September 30, 2024, the maximum undiscounted potential exposure to guarantees issued by our subsidiaries was 2.6 billion, including 1.6 billion of customary payment guarantees under EPC contracts and other agreements, and 996 million of tax equity financing related guarantees. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, our subsidiaries had 1.9 billion of letters of credit outstanding. 
 We expect to continue to seek, where possible, non-recourse debt financing in connection with the assets or businesses that we or our affiliates may develop, construct, or acquire. However, depending on local and global market conditions and the unique characteristics of individual businesses, non-recourse debt may not be available on economically attractive terms or at all. If we decide not to provide any additional funding or credit support to a subsidiary project that is under construction or has near-term debt payment obligations and that subsidiary is unable to obtain additional non-recourse debt, such subsidiary may become insolvent, and we may lose our investment in that subsidiary. Additionally, if any of our subsidiaries lose a significant customer, the subsidiary may need to withdraw from a project or restructure the non-recourse debt financing. If we or the subsidiary choose not to proceed with a project or are unable to successfully complete a restructuring of the non-recourse debt, we may lose our investment in that subsidiary. 
 Many of our subsidiaries depend on timely and continued access to capital markets to manage their liquidity needs. The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, to refinance existing indebtedness, or to fund operations and other commitments during times of political or economic uncertainty may have material adverse effects on the financial condition and results of operations of those subsidiaries. In addition, changes in the timing of tariff increases or delays in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions could affect the cash flows and results of operations of our businesses. 
 
 Long-Term Receivables 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 97 million of gross accounts receivable classified as Other noncurrent assets . These noncurrent receivables mostly consist of accounts receivable in the U.S. and Chile that, pursuant to amended agreements or government resolutions, have collection periods that extend beyond September 30, 2025, or one year from the latest balance sheet date. Noncurrent receivables in the U.S. pertain to the sale of the Redondo Beach land. Noncurrent receivables in Chile pertain primarily to revenues recognized on regulated energy contracts that were impacted by the Stabilization Funds created by the Chilean government. See Note 5 Financing Receivables in Item 1. Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for further information. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 1 billion of loans receivable primarily related to the Mong Duong facility in Vietnam, which was constructed under a build, operate, and transfer contract. This loan receivable represents contract consideration related to the construction of the facility, which was substantially completed in 2015, and will be collected over the 25-year term of the plant s PPA. As of September 30, 2024, Mong Duong met the held-for-sale criteria and the loan receivable balance of 1 billion, net of CECL reserves of 24 million, was classified in held-for-sale assets. Of the loan receivable balance, 118 million was classified in Current held-for-sale assets , and 873 million was classified in Noncurrent held-for-sale assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 14 Revenue in Item 1. Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for further information. 
 
 Cash Sources and Uses 
 The primary sources of cash for the Company in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were debt financings, cash flows from operating activities, purchases under supplier financing arrangements, and sales to noncontrolling interests. The primary uses of cash in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were capital expenditures, repayments of debt, repayments of obligations under supplier financing arrangements, and purchases of short-term investments. 
 The primary sources of cash for the Company in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were debt financings, cash flows from operating activities, purchases under supplier financing arrangements, and sales of short-term investments. The primary uses of cash in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were repayments 

67 | The AES Corporation | September 30, 2024 Form 10-Q 

 of debt, capital expenditures, repayments of obligations under supplier financing arrangements, and purchases of short-term investments. 
 A summary of cash-based activities is as follows (in millions):

 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased 645 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Operating Cash Flows 
 (in millions) 
 
 (1) The change in adjusted net income is defined as the variance in net income , net of the total adjustments to net income as shown on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item 1. Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q. 
 (2) The change in working capital is defined as the variance in total c hanges in operating assets and liabilities as shown on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item 1. Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q. 

68 | The AES Corporation | September 30, 2024 Form 10-Q 

 Adjusted net income increased 84 million, primarily due to higher margins at our Utilities SBU and proceeds from the transfer of U.S. investment tax credits; partially offset by lower margins at our Renewables and Energy Infrastructure SBUs, an increase in interest expense, and a decrease in interest income. 
 Change in working capital decreased 729 million, primarily due to an increase in receivables due to timing of billings and collections, and higher coal consumption coupled with lower coal prices in the prior year; partially offset by the impact of lower coal purchases on accounts payable, and a decrease in other assets due to the sale of financing receivables under the Warrior Run PPA termination agreement. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased 416 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Investing Cash Flows 
 (in millions) 
 
 Cash used for short-term investing activities increased 232 million, primarily as a result of lower net short-term investment sales at our Renewables SBU. 
 Proceeds from sales of business interests decreased 87 million, primarily due to the prior year selldown of sPower OpCo B. 
 Acquisitions of business interests decreased 232 million, primarily due to the prior year acquisitions of Bellefield and Bolero Solar Park at AES Clean Energy and AES Andes, respectively, partially offset by the current year acquisition of Hoosier Wind at AES Indiana. 
 Capital expenditures increased 370 million, discussed further below. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 (in millions) 

69 | The AES Corporation | September 30, 2024 Form 10-Q 

 (1) Growth expenditures generally include expenditures related to development projects in construction, expenditures that increase capacity of a facility beyond the original design, and investments in general load growth or system modernization. 
 (2) Maintenance expenditures generally include expenditures that are necessary to maintain regular operations or net maximum capacity of a facility. 
 (3) Environmental expenditures generally include expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations, expenditures for safety programs and other expenditures to ensure a facility continues to operate in an environmentally responsible manner. 
 Growth expenditures increased 364 million, primarily driven by an increase in renewables project investments in the U.S. and Chile and higher transmission and distribution project investments at our Utilities SBU; partially offset by lower expenditures in Brazil primarily due to the completion of the Cajuina wind projects. 
 Maintenance expenditures increased 5 million, primarily due to higher expenditures at Southland due to the extension of compliance dates for the OTC units, partially offset by the timing of maintenance activities at our Renewables SBU. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities increased 1.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Financing Cash Flows 
 (in millions) 
 
 See Notes 1 Financial Statement Presentation , 8 Debt, and 12 Equity in Item 1. Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for more information regarding significant supplier financing arrangements, debt, and equity transactions, respectively. 
 The 1.4 billion impact from non-recourse debt transactions is mainly due to an increase in borrowings at AES Indiana, AES Andes, and AES Clean Energy Development. 
 The 857 million impact from the Parent Company revolver is due to higher net borrowings in the current period. 
 The 498 million impact from sales to noncontrolling interest is primarily due to an increase in proceeds received at AES Clean Energy from the sales of ownership in project companies to tax equity investors. 
 The 465 million impact from non-recourse revolvers is primarily due to higher net repayments at our Energy Infrastructure and Utilities SBUs. 
 The 450 million impact from recourse debt is primarily due to the prior year issuance of a bridge loan at AES Clean Energy, which was fully guaranteed by the Parent Company, partially offset by an increase in issuances at the Parent Company in the current period. 
 The 409 million impact from supplier financing arrangements is primarily due to higher net repayments at our Renewables SBU. 
 
 Parent Company Liquidity 
 The following discussion is included as a useful measure of the liquidity available to The AES Corporation, or the Parent Company, given the non-recourse nature of most of our indebtedness. Parent Company Liquidity, as outlined below, is a non-GAAP measure and should not be construed as an alternative to Cash and cash equivalents, which is determined in accordance with GAAP. Parent Company Liquidity may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. The principal sources of liquidity at the Parent Company level are dividends 

70 | The AES Corporation | September 30, 2024 Form 10-Q 

 and other distributions from our subsidiaries, including refinancing proceeds; proceeds from debt and equity financings at the Parent Company level, including availability under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program; and proceeds from asset sales. The Parent Company credit facility and commercial paper program are generally used for short-term cash needs to bridge the timing of distributions from subsidiaries. Cash requirements at the Parent Company level are primarily to fund interest and principal repayments of debt, construction commitments, other equity commitments, acquisitions, taxes, Parent Company overhead and development costs, and dividends on common stock. 
 The Company defines Parent Company Liquidity as cash available to the Parent Company, including cash at qualified holding companies, plus available borrowings under our existing credit facility and commercial paper program. The cash held at qualified holding companies represents cash sent to subsidiaries of the Company domiciled outside of the U.S. Such subsidiaries have no contractual restrictions on their ability to send cash to the Parent Company. Parent Company Liquidity is reconciled to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, Cash and cash equivalents , at the periods indicated as follows (in millions): 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Consolidated cash and cash equivalents 1,919 1,426 Less: Cash and cash equivalents at subsidiaries (1,913) (1,393) Parent Company and qualified holding companies cash and cash equivalents 6 33 Commitments under the Parent Company credit facility 1,500 1,500 Less: Letters of credit under the credit facility (24) (124) Less: Borrowings under the credit facility (530) Less: Borrowings under the commercial paper program (611) Borrowings available under the Parent Company credit facility 335 1,376 Total Parent Company Liquidity 341 1,409 
 The Parent Company paid dividends of 0.1725 per outstanding share to its common stockholders during the first, second, and third quarters of 2024 for dividends declared in December 2023, February 2024, and July 2024, respectively. While we intend to continue payment of dividends and believe we will have sufficient liquidity to do so, we can provide no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends, or if continued, the amount of such dividends. 
 
 Recourse Debt 
 Our total recourse debt was 6.5 billion and 4.5 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. See Note 8 Debt in Item 1. Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q and Note 11 Debt in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of our 2023 Form 10-K for additional detail. 
 We believe that our sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future. This belief is based on a number of material assumptions, including, without limitation, assumptions about our ability to access the capital markets, the operating and financial performance of our subsidiaries, currency exchange rates, power market pool prices, and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. In addition, our subsidiaries ability to declare and pay cash dividends to us (at the Parent Company level) is subject to certain limitations contained in loans, governmental provisions and other agreements. We can provide no assurance that these sources will be available when needed or that the actual cash requirements will not be greater than anticipated. We have met our interim needs for shorter-term and working capital financing at the Parent Company level with our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program. See Item 1A. Risk Factors The AES Corporation s ability to make payments on its outstanding indebtedness is dependent upon the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries of the Company s 2023 Form 10-K for additional information. 
 Various debt instruments at the Parent Company level, including our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, contain certain restrictive covenants. The covenants provide for, among other items, limitations on other indebtedness, liens, investments and guarantees; limitations on dividends, stock repurchases and other equity transactions; restrictions and limitations on mergers and acquisitions, sales of assets, leases, transactions with affiliates and off-balance sheet and derivative arrangements; maintenance of certain financial ratios; and financial and other reporting requirements. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with these covenants at the Parent Company level. 
 
 Non-Recourse Debt 
 While the lenders under our non-recourse debt financings generally do not have direct recourse to the Parent Company, defaults thereunder can still have important consequences for our results of operations and liquidity, including, without limitation: 

71 | The AES Corporation | September 30, 2024 Form 10-Q 

 reducing our cash flows as the subsidiary will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to the Parent Company during the time period of any default; 
 triggering our obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee, letter of credit, or other credit support we have provided to or on behalf of such subsidiary; 
 causing us to record a loss in the event the lender forecloses on the assets; and 
 triggering defaults in our outstanding debt at the Parent Company. 
 For example, our revolving credit facility and outstanding debt securities at the Parent Company include events of default for certain bankruptcy-related events involving material subsidiaries. In addition, our revolving credit agreement at the Parent Company includes events of default related to payment defaults and accelerations of outstanding debt of material subsidiaries. 
 Some of our subsidiaries are currently in default with respect to all or a portion of their outstanding indebtedness. The total non-recourse debt classified as current in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets amounts to 3.2 billion. The portion of current debt related to such defaults was 330 million at September 30, 2024, all of which was non-recourse debt related to five subsidiaries: AES Puerto Rico, AES Mexico Generation Holdings, AES Ilumina, AES Jordan Solar, and a project entity at AES Clean Energy Development. AES Puerto Rico is in payment default on its long-term debt and preferred shares due to failure to implement the cash sweep mechanism in accordance with the terms of the loan agreements. AES Puerto Rico is working with the noteholders to resolve this matter. All other subsidiary defaults listed are not payment defaults, but are instead technical defaults triggered by failure to comply with other covenants or other requirements contained in the non-recourse debt documents of the applicable subsidiary. See Note 8 Debt in Item 1. Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for additional detail. 
 None of the subsidiaries that are currently in default are subsidiaries that met the applicable definition of materiality under the Parent Company s debt agreements as of September 30, 2024, in order for such defaults to trigger an event of default or permit acceleration under the Parent Company s indebtedness. However, as a result of additional dispositions of assets, other significant reductions in asset carrying values or other matters in the future that may impact our financial position and results of operations or the financial position of the individual subsidiary, it is possible that one or more of these subsidiaries could fall within the definition of a material subsidiary and thereby trigger an event of default and possible acceleration of the indebtedness under the Parent Company s outstanding debt securities. A material subsidiary is defined in the Parent Company s revolving credit agreement as any business that contributed 20 or more of the Parent Company s total cash distributions from businesses for the four most recently ended fiscal quarters. As of September 30, 2024, none of the defaults listed above resulted in a cross-default under the recourse debt of the Parent Company. Furthermore, none of the non-recourse debt in default listed above is guaranteed by the Parent Company. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The condensed consolidated financial statements of AES are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. 
 The Company s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our 2023 Form 10-K. The Company s critical accounting estimates are described in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the 2023 Form 10-K. An accounting estimate is considered critical if the estimate requires management to make an assumption about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that would have a material impact on the Company s financial condition or results of operations are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Management believes that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. The Company has reviewed and determined that these remain as critical accounting policies as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Overview Regarding Market Risks 
 Our businesses are exposed to, and proactively manage, market risk. Market risk is the potential loss that may 

72 | The AES Corporation | September 30, 2024 Form 10-Q 

 result from market changes associated with AES power generation or with existing or forecasted financial or commodity transactions. Our primary market risk exposure is to the price of commodities, particularly electricity, natural gas, coal, and environmental credits. AES is also exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates associated primarily with outstanding and expected future issuances and borrowing, and from investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. We enter into various transactions, including derivatives, in order to hedge our exposure to these market risks. 
 The disclosures presented in this Item 3 are based upon a number of assumptions; actual effects may differ. The safe harbor provided in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Exchange Act shall apply to the disclosures contained in this Item 3. For further information regarding market risk, see Item 1A. Risk Factors , Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may impact our financial results and position; Wholesale power prices may experience significant volatility in our markets which could impact our operations and opportunities for future growth; We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates; and Certain of our businesses are sensitive to variations in weather and hydrology of the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 Although we prefer to hedge our exposure to the impact of market fluctuations in the price of commodities, some of our generation businesses operate under short-term sales, have contracted electricity obligations greater than supply, or operate under contract sales that leave an unhedged exposure on some of our capacity or through imperfect fuel pass-throughs. These businesses subject our operational results to the volatility of prices for electricity, fuels, and environmental credits in competitive markets. In addition, our businesses are exposed to lower electricity prices due to increased competition, including from renewable sources such as wind and solar, because of lower costs of entry and lower variable costs. We employ risk management strategies to hedge our financial performance against these effects. The implementation of these strategies can involve the use of physical and financial commodity contracts, futures, swaps, and options. We have some natural offsets across our businesses such that low commodity prices may benefit certain businesses and be a cost to others. Exposures are not perfectly linear or symmetric. The sensitivities are affected by a number of local or indirect market factors. Examples of these factors include hydrology, local energy market supply/demand balances, regional fuel supply issues, regional competition, bidding strategies, and regulatory interventions such as price caps. Volume variation also affects our commodity exposure. The volume sold under contracts or retail concessions can vary based on weather and economic conditions, resulting in a higher or lower volume of sales in spot markets. Thermal unit availability and hydrology can affect the generation output available for sale and can affect the marginal unit setting power prices. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we project pre-tax earnings exposure on a 10 increase in commodity prices to be less than a 10 million gain for power, less than a 5 million loss for gas, and less than a 5 million gain for coal. The sensitivities are calculated using industry-standard valuation techniques to revalue all transactions (physical and financial commodity transactions) in the portfolio for a change in the underlying prices the transactions are exposed to and exclude correlation effects, including those due to renewable resource availability. The models reference market prices of commodities across future periods and associated volatility of these market prices. Prices and volatilities are predominantly based on observable market prices. 
 Exposures at individual businesses will change as new contracts or financial hedges are executed, and our sensitivity to changes in commodity prices generally increases in later years with reduced hedge levels at some of our businesses. 
 In the Energy Infrastructure SBU, the generation businesses are largely contracted, but may have residual risk to the extent contracts are not perfectly indexed to the business drivers. In California, our Southland once-through cooling generation units Legacy Assets in Long Beach and Huntington Beach have been extended to operate through 2026 under capacity contracts with the State as part of the Strategic Reserve program. Our facility in Redondo Beach has been retired effective January 1, 2024. Our ability to operate the Long Beach facility at full capacity through 2025 was approved under Tentative Time Schedule Order coverage in November 2023. Approval to operate Long Beach at full capacity in 2026 will be subject to review with State Agencies. Our Southland combined cycle gas turbine (Southland Energy) units benefit from higher power and lower gas prices, depending on the contracted or hedge position. The AES Andes business in Chile owns assets in the central and northern regions of the country and has a portfolio of contract sales in both. A significant portion of our PPAs through 2024 include mechanisms of indexation that adjust the price of energy based on fluctuations in the price of coal, with an index defined by the National Energy Commission based on the physical coal imports for the energy system. This mechanism mitigates exposures to changes in the price of fuel. The increasing share of renewable energy in Chile's power market may reduce reliance on thermal units and impact power price volatility, which could impact our cost to serve certain unregulated PPAs. In the Dominican Republic, we own natural gas plants contracted under a portfolio 

73 | The AES Corporation | September 30, 2024 Form 10-Q 

 of contract sales, and both contract and spot prices may move with commodity prices through 2024. Our thermal asset in Panama has PPAs with distribution companies that match the term of the LNG supply agreement of such thermal assets. New entrants into the Panama thermal generation market could impact the dispatch of existing generation, requiring purchases in the spot market to satisfy the PPA obligations. Contract levels do not always match our generation availability or needs, and our assets may be sellers of spot prices in excess of contract levels or a net buyer in the spot market to satisfy contract obligations, which could impact existing fuel supply commitments. Our assets operating in Vietnam and Bulgaria have minimal exposure to commodity price risk as they have no or minor merchant exposure and fuel is subject to a pass-through mechanism. 
 In the Renewables SBU, our businesses have commodity exposure on unhedged volumes and resource volatility and benefit from higher power prices, where generation exceeds contracted levels. In Colombia, we operate under a shorter-term sales strategy with spot market exposure for uncontracted volumes. Because we own hydroelectric assets there, contracts are not indexed to fuel. In Brazil, the majority of the hydroelectric and other renewable generating facility volumes are covered by contract sales. Under normal hydrological volatility, spot price risk is mitigated through a regulated sharing mechanism across all hydroelectric generators in the country. Under drier conditions, the sharing mechanism may not be sufficient to cover the business' contract position, and therefore it may have to purchase power at spot prices driven by the cost of thermal generation. Our Renewables businesses in Panama are highly contracted under financial and load-following PPA-type structures, exposing the business to hydrology-based variance. To the extent hydrological inflows are greater than or less than the contract volumes, the business will be sensitive to changes in spot power prices which may be driven by oil and natural gas prices in some time periods. 
 Foreign Exchange Rate Risk 
 We operate in multiple countries and as such are subject to volatility in exchange rates at varying degrees at the subsidiary level and between our functional currency, the USD, and currencies of the countries in which we operate. 
 In the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency risk and other foreign operations risks that arise from investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. A key component of these risks stems from the fact that some of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates utilize currencies other than our consolidated reporting currency, the USD. Additionally, certain of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates have entered into monetary obligations in USD or currencies other than their own functional currencies. Certain of our foreign subsidiaries calculate and pay taxes in currencies other than their own functional currency. We have varying degrees of exposure to changes in the exchange rate between the USD and the following currencies: Argentine peso, Brazilian real, Chilean peso, Colombian peso, Dominican peso, Euro, and Mexican peso. Our exposure to certain of these currencies may be material. These subsidiaries and affiliates attempt to limit potential foreign exchange exposure by entering into revenue contracts that adjust to changes in foreign exchange rates. We also use foreign currency forwards, swaps, and options where possible to manage our risk related to certain foreign currency fluctuations. 
 AES enters into foreign currency hedges to protect economic value of the business and minimize the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations to AES' portfolio. While protecting cash flows, the hedging strategy is also designed to reduce forward-looking earnings foreign exchange volatility. Due to variation of timing and amount between cash distributions and earnings exposure, the hedge impact may not fully cover the earnings exposure on a realized basis, which could result in greater volatility in earnings. 
 AES has unhedged forward-looking earnings foreign exchange deterioration risk from the Argentine peso that could be material. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, assuming a 10 USD appreciation, cash distributions attributable to foreign subsidiaries may be exposed to exchange rate movement of less than a 5 million gain from Euro and less than a 5 million gain from the Colombian peso. 
 These numbers have been produced by applying a one-time 10 USD appreciation to forecasted exposed cash distributions for 2024 coming from the respective subsidiaries exposed to the currencies listed above, net of the impact of outstanding hedges and holding all other variables constant. The numbers presented above are net of any transactional gains or losses. These sensitivities may change in the future as new hedges are executed or existing hedges are unwound. Additionally, updates to the forecasted cash distributions exposed to foreign exchange risk may result in further modification. The sensitivities presented do not capture the impacts of any administrative market restrictions or currency inconvertibility. 
 Interest Rate Risks 

74 | The AES Corporation | September 30, 2024 Form 10-Q 

 We are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates primarily because of our current and expected future issuance of debt and borrowing. 
 Decisions on the fixed-floating debt mix are made to be consistent with the risk factors faced by individual businesses or plants. Depending on whether a plant s capacity payments or revenue stream is fixed or varies with inflation, we partially hedge against interest rate fluctuations by arranging fixed-rate or variable-rate financing. In certain cases, particularly for non-recourse financing, we execute interest rate swap, cap, and floor agreements to effectively fix or limit the interest rate exposure on the underlying financing. Most of our interest rate risk is related to non-recourse financings at our businesses. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the portfolio s pre-tax earnings exposure to a one-time 100-basis-point increase in interest rates for our Argentine peso, Brazilian real, Chilean peso, Colombian peso, Euro, and USD denominated debt would be less than 5 million on interest expense for the debt denominated in these currencies. These amounts represent the exposure for the remainder of 2024 and do not take into account the historical correlation between these interest rates. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in such reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes that occurred during the fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II: OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 The Company is involved in certain claims, suits and legal proceedings in the normal course of business. The Company has accrued for litigation and claims when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company believes, based upon information it currently possesses and taking into account established reserves for estimated liabilities and its insurance coverage, that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings and actions is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. It is reasonably possible, however, that some matters could be decided unfavorably to the Company and could require the Company to pay damages or make expenditures in amounts that could be material, but cannot be estimated as of September 30, 2024. Pursuant to SEC amendments Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K, AES policy is to disclose environmental legal proceedings to which a governmental authority is a party if such proceedings are reasonably expected to result in monetary sanctions of greater than or equal to 1 million. 
 In December 2001, Grid Corporation of Odisha GRIDCO served a notice to arbitrate pursuant to the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act of 1996 on the Company, AES Orissa Distribution Private Limited AES ODPL ), and Jyoti Structures Jyoti pursuant to the terms of the shareholders agreement between GRIDCO, the Company, AES ODPL, Jyoti and the Central Electricity Supply Company of Orissa Ltd. CESCO ), an affiliate of the Company. In the arbitration, GRIDCO asserted that a comfort letter issued by the Company in connection with the Company's indirect investment in CESCO obligates the Company to provide additional financial support to cover all of CESCO's financial obligations to GRIDCO. GRIDCO appeared to be seeking approximately 189 million in damages, plus undisclosed penalties and interest, but a detailed alleged damage analysis was not filed by GRIDCO. The Company counterclaimed against GRIDCO for damages. In June 2007, a 2-to-1 majority of the arbitral tribunal rendered its award rejecting GRIDCO's claims and holding that none of the respondents, the Company, AES ODPL, or Jyoti, had any liability to GRIDCO. The respondents' counterclaims were also rejected. A majority of the tribunal later awarded the respondents, including the Company, some of their costs relating to the arbitration. GRIDCO filed challenges of the tribunal's awards with the local Indian court. GRIDCO's challenge of the costs award has been dismissed by the court, but its challenge of the liability award remains pending. A hearing on the liability award has not taken place to date. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. 
 Pursuant to their environmental audit, AES Sul and AES Florestal discovered 200 barrels of solid creosote waste and other contaminants at a pole factory that AES Florestal had been operating. The conclusion of the audit was that a prior operator of the pole factory, Companhia Estadual de Energia CEEE ), had been using those contaminants to treat the poles that were manufactured at the factory. On their initiative, AES Sul and AES Florestal communicated with Brazilian authorities and CEEE about the adoption of containment and remediation measures. In March 2008, the State Attorney of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil filed a public civil action against AES Sul, AES Florestal and CEEE seeking an order requiring the companies to mitigate the contaminated area located on the grounds of the pole factory and an indemnity payment of approximately R 6 million 1 million). In October 2011, the State Attorney filed a request for an injunction ordering the defendant companies to contain and remove the contamination immediately. The court granted injunctive relief on October 18, 2011, but determined that only CEEE was required to perform the removal work. In May 2012, CEEE began the removal work in compliance with the injunction. The case is now awaiting judgment. The removal and remediation costs are estimated to be approximately R 15 million to R 60 million 3 million to 11 million), and there could be additional costs which cannot be estimated at this time. In June 2016, the Company sold AES Sul to CPFL Energia S.A. and as part of the sale, AES Guaiba, a holding company of AES Sul, retained the potential liability relating to this matter. The Company believes that there are meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. 
 In September 2015, AES Southland Development, LLC and AES Redondo Beach, LLC filed a lawsuit against the California Coastal Commission (the CCC over the CCC's determination that the site of AES Redondo Beach included approximately 5.93 acres of CCC-jurisdictional wetlands. The CCC has asserted that AES Redondo Beach has improperly installed and operated water pumps affecting the alleged wetlands in violation of the California Coastal Act and Redondo Beach Local Coastal Program LCP ). Potential outcomes of the CCC determination could include an order requiring AES Redondo Beach to perform a restoration and/or pay fines or penalties. AES Redondo Beach believes that it has meritorious arguments concerning the underlying CCC determination, but there can be no assurances that it will be successful. On March 27, 2020, AES Redondo Beach, LLC sold the site to an unaffiliated third-party purchaser that assumed the obligations contained within these proceedings. On May 26, 2020, CCC staff sent AES an NOV directing AES to discontinue any operation of the water pumps in the alleged 

76 | The AES Corporation | September 30, 2024 Form 10-Q 

 wetlands and to submit a Coastal Development Permit CDP application for the removal of the water pumps within the alleged wetlands. The NOV also directed AES to submit technical analysis regarding additional water pumps located within onsite electrical vaults and, if necessary, a CDP application for their continued operation. With respect to the vault pumps, AES provided the CCC, with the requested analysis, and the CCC has not required further action. With respect to the pumps in the alleged wetlands, AES locked out those pumps to prevent further operation and submitted the CDP to the permitting authority, the City of Redondo Beach (the City ), with respect to AES plans to disable or remove the pumps. On October 14, 2020, the City deemed the CDP application to be complete and indicated a public hearing will be required. AES submitted all required information and waited for the City to continue processing the application. In December 2023, the City indicated it would continue processing the CDP application. AES will vigorously defend its interests with regard to the NOV, but we cannot predict the outcome of the matter at this time. However, settlements and litigated outcomes of Coastal Act and LCP claims alleged against other companies have required them to pay significant civil penalties and undertake remedial measures. 
 In October 2015, AES Indiana received an NOV alleging violations of the Clean Air Act CAA ), the Indiana State Implementation Plan SIP ), and the Title V operating permit related to alleged particulate and opacity violations at Petersburg Station Unit 3. In addition, in February 2016, AES Indiana received an NOV from the EPA alleging violations of New Source Review and other CAA regulations, the Indiana SIP, and the Title V operating permit at Petersburg Station. On August 31, 2020, AES Indiana reached a settlement with the EPA, the DOJ and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management IDEM ), resolving these purported violations of the CAA at Petersburg Station. The settlement agreement, in the form of a proposed judicial consent decree, was approved and entered by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana on March 23, 2021, and includes, among other items, the following requirements: annual caps on NO x and SO 2 emissions and more stringent emissions limits than AES Indiana's current Title V air permit; payment of civil penalties totaling 1.5 million; a 5 million environmental mitigation project consisting of the construction and operation of a new, non-emitting source of generation at the site; expenditure of 0.3 million on a state-only environmentally beneficial project to preserve local, ecologically-significant lands; and retirement of Units 1 and 2 prior to July 1, 2023. 
 In December 2018, a lawsuit was filed in Dominican Republic civil court against the Company, AES Puerto Rico, and three other AES affiliates. The lawsuit purports to be brought on behalf of over 100 Dominican claimants, living and deceased, and appears to seek relief relating to CCRs that were delivered to the Dominican Republic in 2004. The lawsuit generally alleges that the CCRs caused personal injuries and deaths and demands 476 million in alleged damages. The lawsuit does not identify, or provide any supporting information concerning, the alleged injuries of the claimants individually. Nor does the lawsuit provide any information supporting the demand for damages or explaining how the quantum was derived. The relevant AES companies believe that they have meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against them and will defend themselves vigorously in this proceeding; however, there can be no assurances that they will be successful in their efforts. 
 In February 2019, a separate lawsuit was filed in Dominican Republic civil court against the Company, AES Puerto Rico, two other AES affiliates, and an unaffiliated company and its principal. Subsequently, the claimants withdrew the lawsuit with respect to AES Puerto Rico. The lawsuit remains pending against the other AES defendants AES Defendants and the unaffiliated defendants. The lawsuit purports to be brought on behalf of over 200 Dominican claimants, living and deceased, and appears to seek relief relating to CCRs that were delivered to the Dominican Republic in 2003 and 2004. The lawsuit generally alleges that the CCRs caused personal injuries and deaths and demands over 900 million in alleged damages. The lawsuit does not identify, or provide any supporting information concerning, the alleged injuries of the claimants individually, nor does the lawsuit provide any information supporting the demand for damages or explaining how the quantum was derived. In August 2020, at the request of the relevant AES companies, the case was transferred to a different civil court, namely, the Civil Court of La Vega CFI ). In May 2024, the CFI dismissed the entire case due to the expiry of the statute of limitations. The claimants may seek to appeal. Recently, the claimants appealed the dismissal to the relevant intermediate appellate court. To date, the AES Defendants have not been formally served with the appeal. The AES Defendants believe that they have meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against them and will defend themselves vigorously in this proceeding; however, there can be no assurances that they will be successful in their efforts. 
 In October 2019, the Superintendency of the Environment (the "SMA") notified AES Andes of certain alleged breaches associated with the environmental permit of the Ventanas Complex, initiating a sanctioning process through Exempt Resolution N 1 / ROL D-129-2019. The alleged charges include exceeding generation limits, failing to reduce emissions during episodes of poor air quality, exceeding limits on discharges to the sea, and exceeding noise limits. AES Andes has submitted a proposed Compliance Program to the SMA for the Ventanas Complex. The latest version of this Compliance Program was submitted on May 26, 2021. On December 30, 2021, the Compliance Program was approved by the SMA. However an ex officio action was brought by the SMA due to alleged exceedances of generation limits, which would require the Company to reduce SO 2 , NO X and PM emissions 

77 | The AES Corporation | September 30, 2024 Form 10-Q 

 in order to achieve the emissions offset established in the Compliance Program. On January 6, 2022, AES Andes filed a reposition with the SMA seeking modification of the means for compliance with the ex officio action. On January 17, 2023, the SMA approved street paving measures, or alternatively a program providing heaters for community members, as the means to satisfy the air emissions offsets in the approved Compliance Plan. The cost of the proposed Compliance Program is approximately 10.8 million USD and is in the execution stage. Fines are possible if the SMA determines there is an unsatisfactory execution of the Compliance Program. On April 21, 2023, the SMA notified AES Andes of a resolution alleging an additional serious non-compliance of the Ventanas Complex failing to reduce emissions during episodes of poor air quality. On May 24, 2023, AES Andes submitted disclaimers to the SMA in response to this resolution. On May 10, 2024, the Company was notified of a fine for 180,515 USD. On June 3, 2024, the Company appealed this fine to the Environmental Court. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses and will continue to assert them vigorously in this dispute; however, there can be no assurances that it will successful. 
 In March 2020, Mexico s Comisi n Federal de Electricidad CFE served an arbitration demand upon AES M rida III. CFE alleged that AES M rida was in breach of a power and capacity purchase agreement Contract between the two parties, even though the allegations relate to CFE s own failure to provide fuel within the specifications of the Contract. CFE sought to recover approximately 200 million in payments made to AES M rida under the Contract as well as approximately 480 million in alleged damages for having to acquire power from alternative sources in the Yucatan Peninsula. AES M rida filed an answer denying liability to CFE and asserted a counterclaim for damages due to CFE s breach of its obligations. The evidentiary hearing took place in November 2021. Closing arguments were heard in May 2022. In November 2022, the arbitration Tribunal issued its decision in the case, rejecting CFE s claims for damages and granting AES M rida a net amount of damages on AES M rida s counterclaims ("Award"). There are ongoing proceedings in the Mexican courts concerning AES M rida's attempt to enforce the Award and CFE's attempt to challenge the Award. The enforcement proceeding initiated by AES M rida is still pending before the relevant court of first instance. In contrast, in March 2024, the relevant court of first instance denied CFE s request to nullify the Award March 2024 Decision ). The March 2024 Decision was affirmed by the relevant federal District Court and is currently under review by the Collegiate Circuit Court. AES M rida believes that it has meritorious claims and defenses and will assert them vigorously in this dispute; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. 
 On May 12, 2021, the Mexican Federal Attorney for Environmental Protection (the Authority initiated an environmental audit at the TEP thermal generating facility. On January 20, 2023, TEP was notified of the resolution issued by the Authority, which alleges breaches of air emission regulations, including the failure to submit reports. The resolution imposes a fine of 27,615,140 pesos (approximately USD 1.5 million). On March 3, 2023, the facility filed a nullity judgment to challenge such resolution, which has been admitted by the local judge with an injunction granted against execution of the proposed fine during the course of the underlying proceedings. However, the local tax authority rejected receiving the bond that is required to guarantee the injunction, and as a result, on September 18, 2023, TEP filed a complaint seeking to compel the tax authority to accept the bond and recognize the validity of the injunction. The Specialized Chamber has not issued a response to the complaint, and therefore on January 12, 2024, TEP filed a request for the Specialized Chamber to rule on the admission of the complaint. On February 2, 2024, TEP filed an amparo lawsuit on the basis that no resolution has been issued regarding TEP's May 2023 filing with the Chamber to inform if the Authority had submitted its response to the nullity lawsuit, and if not, to declare that the Authority's right precluded. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. 
 In February 2022, a lawsuit was filed in Dominican Republic civil court against the Company. The lawsuit purports to be brought on behalf of over 425 Dominican claimants, living and deceased, and appears to seek relief relating to CCRs that were delivered to the Dominican Republic in 2003 and 2004. The lawsuit generally alleges that the CCRs caused personal injuries and deaths and demands over 600 million in alleged damages. The lawsuit does not identify or provide any supporting information concerning the alleged injuries of the claimants individually. Nor does the lawsuit provide any information supporting the demand for damages or explaining how the quantum was derived. In February 2024, at the request of the Company, the Dominican Supreme Court of Justice transferred the case to a different civil court, namely, the Civil Court of La Vega. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in this proceeding; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. 
 On July 25, 2022, AES Puerto Rico, LP AES-PR received from the EPA an NOV alleging certain violations of the CAA at AES-PR s coal-fired power facility in Guayama, Puerto Rico. The NOV alleged AES-PR exceeded an emission limit and did not continuously operate certain monitoring equipment, conduct certain analyses and testing, maintain complete records, and submit certain reports as required by the EPA s Mercury and Air Toxics Standards. 

78 | The AES Corporation | September 30, 2024 Form 10-Q 

 The NOV further alleged AES-PR did not comply fully with the facility s Title V operating permit. In August 2024, AES-PR and the EPA entered into a Consent Agreement and Final Order CAFO settling this matter. Pursuant to the CAFO, AES-PR paid a 3.125 million fine to the agency and agreed to implement certain additional compliance and reporting measures. 
 On January 26, 2023, the SMA notified Alto Maipo SpA of four alleged charges relating to the Alto Maipo facility, all of which are categorized by the SMA as serious. The alleged charges include untimely completion of intake works and insufficient capture by the provisional works, irrigation water outlet and canal contemplated by an agreement with local communities; non-compliance with the details of the forest management plans and intervention in unauthorized areas; construction of a road in a restricted paleontological area; and unlawful moving of fauna. On February 16, 2023, the Alto Maipo project submitted a compliance program to the SMA which has undergone two rounds of observations by the SMA and interested third parties. On June 19, 2024, the SMA issued new observations. In response, on July 17, 2024, Alto Maipo submitted an updated version of the compliance program, which is currently under review by the Environmental Authority. The costs associated with the compliance program are estimated to amount to CLP 3,111,437 (approximately 3 million USD). If the compliance program is not approved, Alto Maipo reserves the right to appeal such a decision before the environmental courts. If such an appeal is unsuccessful - or if the compliance program is not executed to the satisfaction of the SMA - fines, revocation of the facility s RCA environmental permit, or facility closure are possible outcomes for such alleged serious violations under applicable regulations. 
 In May 2024, the Chilean competition agency (the Fiscal a Nacional Econ mica or FNE opened an investigation regarding AES Andes s declarations with respect to coal prices and coal blends used to generate electricity in Chile. The investigation was prompted by a confidential complaint filed in December 2023, which has not been disclosed to AES Andes. In general terms, the investigation seeks to determine whether the facts alleged in the complaint could be considered as an abuse of a dominant position by AES Andes. The investigation is at a very early stage; AES Andes is currently responding to the FNE s information requests. The FNE will independently conduct the investigation and will ultimately decide whether to dismiss the matter or initiate a judicial proceeding on the allegations in the confidential complaint. These types of investigations in Chile commonly last for years. AES Andes does not believe that it has violated any competition laws. Further, if the FNE ever initiates a judicial proceeding on this matter, AES Andes will defend itself vigorously. Given the early nature of this investigation, we are unable to estimate any potential impact of the investigation or its eventual outcome on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

 (1) On July 7, 2010, The AES Corporation announced that its Board of Directors approved a common stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase up to 500 million of shares of its outstanding common stock, depending on cash availability, market conditions, and other factors. The original authorization was set to expire on December 31, 2010, however, in December 2010, the Board authorized an extension of the stock repurchase program. The current program does not have a predetermined expiration date. Repurchases under this program may be made using a variety of methods, which may include open market repurchases, purchases by contract (including, without limitation, accelerated stock repurchase programs or 10b5-1 plans), and/or privately negotiated transactions. No repurchases were made under this program during the third quarter of 2024. As of September 30, 2024, 264 million remained available for purchase under this authorization.

Information disclosed in one section of the notice in response to one provision of such Sections shall not be deemed responsive to any other provision of such Sections unless it is expressly cross-referenced to such other provision and it is clearly apparent how the information included in one section of the notice is directly and expressly responsive to the information required to be included in another section of the notice. For the avoidance of doubt, statements purporting to provide global cross-references that purport to provide that all information provided shall be deemed to be responsive to all requirements of this Section 2.16 (and, as applicable, Section 2.15, Section 9.01 and Section 9.02) shall not satisfy the requirements thereof and shall be disregarded. 
 1.16.7. For a notice to comply with the requirements of this Section 2.16 (and, as applicable, Section 2.15, Section 9.01 and Section 9.02), it must set forth in writing directly within the body of the notice (as opposed to being incorporated by reference from any other document or writing not prepared solely in response to the requirements of these By-Laws) all the information required to be included therein as set forth in such Section(s). A notice shall not be deemed to be in compliance with such Section(s) if it attempts to include the required information by incorporating by reference 

into the body of the notice any other document, writing or part thereof, including, but not limited to, any documents publicly filed with the SEC not prepared solely in response to the requirements of these By-Laws. For the further avoidance of doubt, the body of the notice shall not include any documents that are not prepared solely in response to the requirements of these By-Laws.

If such information shall not be true, correct and complete in all respects prior to the deadline for submitting the notice, such information may be deemed not to have been validly provided. 
 1.17. (A) Any action that may be taken at any annual meeting or special meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting and without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is signed by the stockholders having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Prompt notice of the taking of such action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to each stockholder who did not consent thereto in writing. 
 1.17.1. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more than ten days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request the 

Board of Directors to fix a record date. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within ten days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within ten days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in Delaware, its principal place of business or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporation s registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business (as defined in Section 2.15(E)) on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolutions taking such prior action.

 2.7.Members of the Board of Directors or any committee designated by the Board pursuant to Section 3.12 may participate in a meeting of such Board or committee by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.

Attendance in person or by proxy of a person at a meeting of stockholders shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the stockholder attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting and does so object at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Any director attending a meeting of the Board of Directors without protesting, prior to the meeting or at its commencement, any lack of notice shall be conclusively deemed to have waived notice of such meeting.

 5.1.The shares of capital stock of the Corporation may be represented by certificates or may be uncertificated. To the extent that shares are represented by certificates, the certificates shall be in such form as shall be determined by the Board of Directors and shall be numbered consecutively and entered in the books of the Corporation as they are issued. Every holder of shares of capital stock of the Corporation theretofore represented by certificates and, upon request, every holder of uncertificated shares, shall be entitled to have a certificate for shares of capital stock of the Corporation in the form approved by the Board of Directors, signed by, or in the name of the Corporation by, (A) the Chairperson of the Board or the President or a Vice President and (B) the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, certifying the number of such shares owned by such stockholder in the Corporation.

 5.2.Where any such certificate is signed either by a transfer agent or an assistant transfer agent, or by a transfer clerk acting on behalf of the Corporation and by a registrar, the signature of any such Chairperson of the Board, President, Vice President, Treasurer, Assistant Treasurer, Secretary or Assistant Secretary may be facsimile. In case any such officer who has signed, or whose facsimile signature has been affixed on, any such certificate shall cease to be such officer, whether because of resignation, removal or otherwise, before such certificate has been 

issued or delivered by the Corporation, such certificate may nevertheless be issued and delivered by the Corporation with the same effect as if such officer had not ceased to be such at the date of such delivery. 
 5.3.In case any certificate of stock shall be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Board of Directors, in its discretion, or any officer or officers thereunto duly authorized by the Board, may authorize the issuance of uncertificated shares or, if requested by the registered owner, a substitute certificate in place of the certificate so lost, stolen or destroyed provided, however, that in each such case the applicant for uncertificated shares or a substitute certificate shall furnish evidence to the Corporation which the Board of Directors, or any office or officers authorized as aforesaid, determines is satisfactory, of the loss, theft or destruction of such certificate and of the ownership thereof, and also such security or indemnity as may be required by the Board.

With respect to certificated shares of stock, every certificate exchanged, returned or surrendered to the Corporation shall be marked Cancelled, with the date of cancellation, by the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Corporation or the transfer agent of the Corporation.

 5.5.(A) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of 

Directors, and which record date shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business (as defined in Section 2.15(E) above) on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting providing, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. 
 5.6.The Corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends, and to vote as such owner, and to hold liable for calls and assessments a person registered on its books as the owner of shares, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by Delaware Law.

the laws of the State of Delaware as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than such laws permitted prior to such amendment), against all expenses (including, but not limited to, attorneys fees), judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with the action, suit or proceeding. In the event of any action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor, such persons shall be indemnified by the Corporation against expenses (including attorneys fees) under the same conditions and to the same extent as specified above, except that no indemnification is permitted in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such persons shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper. The indemnification expressly provided by statute in a specific case shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any person indemnified may be entitled under any lawful agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

undertaking by or on behalf of such director, officer or employee to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such director, officer or employee is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article VIII or otherwise. 
 7.1.2. To obtain indemnification under this Article VIII, an indemnitee shall submit to the Corporation a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to such person and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the indemnitee is entitled to indemnification. 
 7.1.3. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss incurred by such person in any such capacity or arising out of such person s status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under Delaware Law. To the extent that the Corporation maintains any policy or policies providing such insurance, each such director, officer or employee, and each such agent to which rights to indemnification have been granted as provided in paragraph (E) of this Section 8.01, shall be covered by such policy or policies in accordance with its or their terms to the maximum extent of the coverage thereunder for any such director, officer, employee or agent. 
 7.1.4.
