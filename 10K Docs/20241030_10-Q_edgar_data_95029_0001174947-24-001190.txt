million per claim, or an aggregate maximum loss of million annually, except for certain new claims which might be brought by governments
or municipalities after July 10, 2000, which are excluded from coverage. Insurance coverage was not renewed with incumbent carriers effective
September 1, 2024. Rather, the Company established a wholly-owned captive insurance company for claims made on or after September 1, 2024. 

The Company management monitors
the status of known claims and the product liability accrual, which includes amounts for asserted and unasserted claims. While it is not
possible to forecast the outcome of litigation or the timing of costs, in the opinion of management, after consultation with special and
corporate counsel, it is not probable and is unlikely that litigation, including punitive damage claims, will have a material adverse
effect on the financial position of the Company, but may have a material impact on the Company's financial results for a particular period. 

Product liability claim payments
are made when appropriate if, as, and when claimants and the Company reach agreement upon an amount to finally resolve all claims. Legal
costs are paid as the lawsuits and claims develop, the timing of which may vary greatly from case to case. A time schedule cannot be determined
in advance with any reliability concerning when payments will be made in any given case. 

Provision is made for product
liability claims based upon many factors related to the severity of the alleged injury and potential liability exposure, based upon prior
claim experience. Because the Company's experience in defending these lawsuits and claims is that unfavorable outcomes are typically not
probable or estimable, only in rare cases is an accrual established for such costs. 

In most cases, an accrual
is established only for estimated legal defense costs. Product liability accruals are periodically reviewed to reflect then-current estimates
of possible liabilities and expenses incurred to date and reasonably anticipated in the future. Threatened product liability claims are
reflected in the Company's product liability accrual on the same basis as actual claims; i.e. , an accrual is made for reasonably
anticipated possible liability and claims handling expenses on an ongoing basis.

. The amount claimed at December 31, 2021 was million and is set forth as an indication of possible maximum

of this amount being awarded to claimants) as a result of adverse judgments that are sustained on appeal. 

per share, for shareholders of record as of , payable

The Company
has evaluated events and transactions occurring subsequent to September 28, 2024 and determined that there were no other unreported events
or transactions that would have a material impact on the Company s results of operations or financial position.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Company Overview 

Sturm, Ruger Company,
Inc. (the Company is principally engaged in the design, manufacture, and sale of firearms to domestic customers. Approximately
99 of sales are from firearms. Export sales accounted for approximately 5 and 7 of total sales for the nine month periods ended September
28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The Company s design and manufacturing operations are located in the United States
and almost all product content is domestic. The Company s firearms are sold through a select number of independent wholesale distributors,
principally to the commercial sporting market. 

The Company also manufactures
investment castings made from steel alloys and metal injection molding MIM parts for internal use in its firearms and
for sale to unaffiliated, third-party customers. Less than 1 of sales are from the castings segment. 

Orders for many models of
firearms from the independent distributors tend to be stronger in the first quarter of the year and weaker in the third quarter of the
year. This is due in part to the timing of the distributor show season, which occurs during the first quarter. 

Results of Operations 

Demand 

The estimated unit sell-through
of the Company s products from the independent distributors to retailers increased 4 in the first nine months of 2024 compared
to the prior year period. For the same period, National Instant Criminal Background Check System NICS background checks
(as adjusted by the National Shooting Sports Foundation NSSF )) decreased 3 . Estimated sell-through from the independent
distributors to retailers and total adjusted NICS background checks for the trailing seven quarters follow:

(1) The estimates for each period were calculated by taking the beginning inventory at the distributors, plus
shipments from the Company to distributors during the period, less the ending inventory at distributors. These estimates are only a proxy
for actual market demand as they: 

Rely on data provided by independent distributors that are not verified by the Company, 

Do not consider potential timing issues within the distribution channel, including goods-in-transit, and 

Do not consider fluctuations in inventory at retail. 

21 

(2) NICS background checks are performed when the ownership of most firearms, either new or used, is transferred
by a Federal Firearms Licensee. NICS background checks are also performed for permit applications, permit renewals, and other administrative
reasons. 

The adjusted NICS
data presented above was derived by the NSSF by subtracting out NICS checks that are not directly related to the sale of a firearm, including
checks used for concealed carry CCW permit application checks, as well as checks on active CCW permit databases. The adjusted
NICS checks represent less than half of the total NICS checks. 

Adjusted NICS data can be impacted
by changes in state laws and regulations and any directives and interpretations issued by governmental agencies. 

Orders Received and Ending Backlog 

The Company uses the estimated
unit sell-through of its products from the independent distributors to retailers, along with inventory levels at the independent distributors
and at the Company, as the key metrics for planning production levels. The Company generally does not use the orders received or ending
backlog for planning production levels. 

The units ordered, value of
orders received, average sales price of units ordered, and ending backlog for the trailing seven quarters are as follows (dollars in millions,
except average sales price):

The increase in total consolidated
net sales and net firearms sales for the three months ended September 28, 2024 is attributable to strong demand for certain of the Commpany s
firearms. Sales of new products, including the Security-380 pistol, Super Wrangler revolver, Marlin lever-action rifles, LC Carbine, Small-Frame
Autoloading Rifle, and American Centerfire Rifle Generation II represented 35.5 million or 31.0 of firearm sales in the three months
ended September 28, 2024. New product sales include only major new products that were introduced in the past two years. 

The decreased gross profit
for the three months ended September 28, 2024 is attributable to unfavorable deleveraging of fixed costs resulting from decreased production
and a product mix shift toward products with relatively lower margins that remain in relatively stronger demand. 

The decrease in gross margin
for the three months ended September 28, 2024 is attributable to the aforementioned factors, partially offset by increased pricing.

The decrease in total consolidated
net sales and net firearms sales for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 is attributable to decreased consumer demand for firearms.
Sales of new products, including the Security-380 pistol, Super Wrangler revolver, Marlin lever-action rifles, LC Carbine, Small-Frame
Autoloading Rifle, and American Centerfire Rifle Generation II, represented 113.3 million or 31.2 of firearm sales in the first nine
months of 2024. New product sales include only major new products that were introduced in the past two years. 

The decreased gross profit
for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 is attributable to unfavorable deleveraging of fixed costs resulting from decreased production,
a product mix shift toward products with relatively lower margins that remain in relatively stronger demand, and the decrease in sales. 

The decrease in gross margin
for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 is attributable to the aforementioned factors, partially offset by increased pricing.

The increase in selling expenses
for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 was attributable increased spending on advertising, partially offset by modest reductions
in several selling and marketing initiatives. 

The increase in general and
administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 was primarily attributable to accrued severances of 1.5 million
taken in the first quarter of 2024 related to a reduction in force involving approximately 80 employees, partially offset by decreased
incentive compensation expenses. The aforementioned accrued severances are expected to be settled in cash and consist of one-time termination
charges arising from severance obligations and other customary employee benefit payments in connection with a reduction in force. 

The reduction in force is
expected to result in approximately 9 million of annualized cash savings. This action is part of the Company s initiatives to reallocate
its resources and cost structure into prioritized areas that will drive long-term growth and improve margins.

The decrease in other income

Income Taxes and Net Income 

The Company's 2024 and 2023
effective tax rates differ from the statutory federal tax rate due principally to research and development tax credits, state income taxes
and the nondeductibility of certain executive compensation. The Company s effective income tax rate was 10.0 and 18.9 for the
three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, respectively. The Company s effective income tax rate was 8.1 and 18.9 for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

As a result of the foregoing
factors, consolidated net income was 4.7 million for the three months ended September 28, 2024, a decrease of 36.2 from 7.4 million
in the comparable prior year period. 

26 

Consolidated net income was
 20.1 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024, a decrease of 47.1 from 38.0 million in the comparable prior year period. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

In an effort to provide investors
with additional information regarding its financial results, the Company refers to various United States generally accepted accounting
principles GAAP financial measures and two non-GAAP financial measures, EBITDA and EBITDA margin, which management believes
provides useful information to investors. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled financial measures
being disclosed by other companies. In addition, the Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition
to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that EBITDA and EBITDA margin are useful to understanding its operating
results and the ongoing performance of its underlying business, as EBITDA provides information on the Company s ability to meet
its capital expenditure and working capital requirements, and is also an indicator of profitability. The Company believes that this reporting
provides better transparency and comparability to its operating results. The Company uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures to
evaluate the Company s financial performance. 

EBITDA is defined as earnings
before interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization. The Company calculates this by adding the amount of interest expense, income
tax expense, and depreciation and amortization expenses that have been deducted from net income back into net income, and subtracting
the amount of interest income that was included in net income from net income to arrive at EBITDA. The Company calculates EBITDA margin
by dividing EBITDA by total net sales. 

EBITDA was 9.9 million for
the three months ended September 28, 2024, a decrease of 25.2 from 13.3 million in the comparable prior year period. 

For the nine months ended
September 28, 2024 EBITDA was 37.9 million, a decrease of 39.2 from 62.4 million in the comparable prior year period.

Financial Condition 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

At the end of the third quarter
of 2024, the Company s cash and short-term investments totaled 96.0 million. Pre-LIFO working capital of 260.4 million, less the
LIFO reserve of 68.3 million, resulted in working capital of 192.1 million and a current ratio of 4.5 to 1. 

Operations 

Cash provided by operating
activities was 35.5 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024, compared to 1.3 million for the comparable prior year period.
The increase in cash provided in the nine months ended September 28, 2024 is primarily attributable to decreases in inventory and prepaid
expenses and other assets in the nine months ended September 28, 2024, partially offset by the decrease in net income in the nine months
ended September 28, 2024. 

Third parties supply the Company
with various raw materials for its firearms and castings, such as steel, fabricated steel components, walnut, birch, beech, maple and
laminated lumber for rifle stocks, wax, ceramic material, metal alloys, various synthetic products and other component parts. A limited
supply of these materials in the marketplace can result in increases to purchase prices and adversely affect production levels. If market
conditions result in a significant prolonged inflation of certain prices or if adequate quantities of raw materials cannot be obtained,
the Company s manufacturing processes could be interrupted and the Company s financial condition or results of operations
could be materially adversely affected. 

Investing and Financing 

Capital expenditures for the
nine months ended September 28, 2024 totaled 17.2 million, an increase from 11.6 million in the comparable prior year period. In 2024,
the Company expects capital expenditures related to new product introductions and upgrades to our manufacturing equipment and facilities
to total approximately 20 million. Actual capital expenditures could vary significantly from the projected amount due to the timing of
capital projects. The Company finances, and intends to continue to finance, all of these activities with funds provided by operations
and current cash and cash equivalents. 

Dividends of 10.0 million
were paid during the nine months ended September 28, 2024. The Company has financed its dividends with cash provided by operations and
current cash. The quarterly dividend varies every quarter because the Company pays a percentage of earnings rather than a fixed amount
per share. The Company s practice is to pay a dividend of approximately 40 of net income. 

On October 25, 2024, the Company s
Board of Directors authorized a dividend of 11 per share to shareholders of record on November 13, 2024, payable on November 27,
2024. The payment of future dividends depends on many factors, including internal estimates of future performance, then-current cash and
short-term investments, and the Company s need for funds. 

As of September 28, 2024,
the Company had 61.5 million of United States Treasury instruments which mature within one year. The Company also invests available cash
in a bank-managed money market fund that invests exclusively in United States Treasury instruments which mature within one year. At September
28, 2024, the Company s investment in this money market fund totaled 27.0 million. 

During the nine months ended
September 28, 2024 the Company purchased 698,759 shares of its common stock for 29.3 million in the open market. The average price per
share purchased was 41.99. These purchases were funded with cash on hand. As of September 28, 2024, 45.3 million remained authorized
for future stock repurchases. 

28 

Based on its unencumbered
assets, the Company believes it has the ability to raise cash through the issuance of short-term or long-term debt. The Company s
unsecured 40 million credit facility, which expires on January 7, 2028, was unused at September 28, 2024. 

Other Operational Matters 

In the normal course of its
manufacturing operations, the Company is subject to occasional governmental proceedings and orders pertaining to workplace safety, firearms
serial number tracking and control, waste disposal, air emissions and water discharges into the environment. The Company believes that
it is generally in compliance with applicable Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms Explosives, environmental, and safety regulations
and the outcome of any proceedings or orders will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations
of the Company. If these regulations become more stringent in the future and the Company is not able to comply with them, such noncompliance
could have a material adverse impact on the Company. 

The Company has 15 independent
distributors that service the domestic commercial market. Additionally, the Company has 44 and 26 distributors servicing the export and
law enforcement markets, respectively. 

The Company self-insures a
significant amount of its product liability, workers compensation, medical, and other insurance. It also carries significant deductible
amounts on various insurance policies. In September 2024, the Company did not renew its product liability coverage with its incumbent
carriers and established a wholly-owned captive insurance company for claims made on or after September 1, 2024. 

The Company expects to realize
its deferred tax assets through tax deductions against future taxable income. 

Adjustments to Critical Accounting Policies 

The Company has not made any
adjustments to its critical accounting estimates and assumptions described in the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed
on February 21, 2024, or the judgments affecting the application of those estimates and assumptions. 

Forward-Looking Statements and Projections 

The Company may, from time
to time, make forward-looking statements and projections concerning future expectations. Such statements are based on current expectations
and are subject to certain qualifying risks and uncertainties, such as market demand, sales levels of firearms, anticipated castings sales
and earnings, the need for external financing for operations or capital expenditures, the results of pending litigation against the Company,
the impact of future firearms control and environmental legislation, and accounting estimates, any one or more of which could cause actual
results to differ materially from those projected. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements,
which speak only as of the date made. The Company undertakes no obligation to publish revised forward-looking statements to reflect events
or circumstances after the date such forward-looking statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of subsequent unanticipated events. 

29 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

The interest rate market risk
implicit to the Company at any given time is typically low, as the Company does not have significant exposure to changing interest rates
on invested cash. There has been no material change in the Company s exposure to interest rate risks during the three months ended
September 28, 2024. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Company s management,
with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of
the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (the Disclosure Controls and Procedures ), as such term is defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of September
28, 2024. 

Based on that evaluation,
the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 28, 2024, such Disclosure
Controls and Procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s periodic reports filed
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange
Commission s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including
its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding disclosure. 

The Company s Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have further concluded that, as of September 28, 2024, there have been no material changes
in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
during the quarter ended September 28, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal
control over financial reporting. 

The effectiveness of any system
of internal controls and procedures is subject to certain limitations, and, as a result, there can be no assurance that the Disclosure
Controls and Procedures will detect all errors or fraud. An internal control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the internal control system will be attained.
