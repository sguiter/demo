(the TRS Lessee and its subsidiaries, invests in hotels where it can add value through capital investment, hotel repositioning and asset management. In addition, the Company seeks to capitalize on its portfolio s embedded value and balance sheet strength to actively recycle past investments into new growth and value creation opportunities in order to deliver strong stockholder returns and superior per share net asset value growth. As a REIT, certain tax laws limit the amount of non-qualifying income the Company can earn, including income derived directly from the operation of hotels. The Company leases all of its hotels to its TRS Lessee, which in turn enters into long-term management agreements with third parties to manage the operations of the Company s hotels, in transactions that are intended to generate qualifying income. As of both September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company owned hotels.

 million held in escrow related to certain current and potential employee-related obligations at one of the Company s former hotels. In the second quarter of 2024, the escrow agreement was terminated and the remaining million of restricted cash held in escrow was returned to the Company (see Note 11). As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, restricted cash included million held as collateral for certain letters of credit (see Note 11). for buildings and improvements and three years to for FF E. Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of their estimated useful life or over the length of the related agreement. The Company s investment in hotel properties, net also includes initial franchise fees which are recorded at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over the terms of the franchise agreements ranging from fifteen years to . All other franchise fees that are based on the Company s results of operations are expensed as incurred. While the Company believes its estimates are reasonable, a change in the estimated lives could affect depreciation expense and net income or the gain or loss on the sale of any of the Company s hotels. The Company has not changed the useful lives of any of its assets during the periods discussed. Impairment losses are recorded on investments in hotel properties to be held and used by the Company whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Factors the Company considers when assessing whether impairment indicators exist include, but are not limited to, hotel disposition strategy and hold period, a significant decline in operating results not related to renovations or repositionings, significant changes in the manner in which the Company uses the asset, physical damage to the property due to unforeseen events such as natural disasters, and other market and economic conditions. Recoverability of assets that will continue to be used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the related total future undiscounted net cash flows. If an asset s carrying value is not recoverable through those cash flows, the asset is considered to be impaired. The impairment is measured by the difference between the asset s carrying amount and its fair value. The Company performs a fair value assessment using valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows and comparable sale transactions in the market to estimate the fair value of the hotel and, if appropriate and available, current estimated net sales proceeds from pending offers. The Company s judgment is required in determining the discount rate, terminal capitalization rate, the estimated growth of revenues and expenses, revenue per available room and margins, as well as specific market and economic conditions. Based on the Company s review, hotels were impaired during either the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Fair value represents the amount at which an asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties, that is, other than a forced or liquidation sale. The estimation process involved in determining if assets have been impaired and in the determination of fair value is inherently uncertain because it requires estimates of current market yields as well as future events and conditions. Such future events and conditions include economic and market conditions, as well as the availability of suitable financing. The realization of the Company s investment in hotel properties is dependent upon future uncertain events and conditions and, accordingly, the actual timing and amounts realized by the Company may be materially different from their estimated fair values.

 or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. Expense for these short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For leases with an initial term greater than , the Company records a right-of-use ROU asset and a corresponding lease obligation. ROU assets represent the Company s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease obligations represent the Company s obligation to make fixed lease payments as stipulated by the lease. The Company has elected to not separate lease components from nonlease components, resulting in the Company accounting for lease and nonlease components as one single lease component. Leases are accounted for using a dual approach, classifying leases as either operating or financing based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase of the leased asset by the Company. This classification determines whether the lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease for operating leases or based on an effective interest method for finance leases. Lease ROU assets are recognized at the lease commencement date and include the amount of the initial operating lease obligation, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, excluding any lease incentives received, and any initial direct costs incurred. For leases that have extension options that the Company can exercise at its discretion, management uses judgment to determine if it is reasonably certain that the Company will in fact exercise such option. If the extension option is reasonably certain to occur, the Company includes the extended term s lease payments in the calculation of the respective lease liability. None of the Company s leases contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Lease obligations are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the Company s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate IBR based on information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The IBR is the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. In order to estimate the Company s IBR, the Company first looks to its own unsecured debt offerings, and adjusts the rate for both length of term and secured borrowing using available market data as well as consultations with leading national financial institutions that are active in the issuance of both secured and unsecured notes. The Company reviews its right-of-use assets for indicators of impairment. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the related assets are adjusted to their estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized. The impairment loss recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets. Based on the Company s review, ROU assets were impaired during either the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

We operate as a self-managed and self-administered real estate investment trust REIT ). A REIT is a corporation that directly or indirectly owns real estate assets and has elected to be taxable as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes. To qualify for taxation as a REIT, the REIT must meet certain requirements, including regarding the composition of its assets and the sources of its income. REITs generally are not subject to federal income taxes at the corporate level as long as they pay stockholder dividends equivalent to 100 of their taxable income. REITs are required to distribute to stockholders at least 90 of their REIT taxable income. We own, directly or indirectly, 100 of the interests of Sunstone Hotel Partnership, LLC (the Operating Partnership ), which is the entity that directly or indirectly owns our hotels. We also own 100 of the interests of our taxable REIT subsidiary, Sunstone Hotel TRS Lessee, Inc. (the TRS Lessee ), which, directly or indirectly, leases all of our hotels from the Operating Partnership, and engages independent third-parties to manage our hotels. We own hotels in urban and resort destinations that benefit from significant barriers to entry by competitors and diverse economic drivers. As of September 30, 2024, we owned 15 hotels (the 15 Hotels ), which average 484 rooms in size. All of our hotels are operated under nationally recognized brands, except the Oceans Edge Resort Marina, which has established itself in a resort destination market. Operating Activities Revenues. Substantially all of our revenues are derived from the operation of our hotels. Specifically, our revenues consist of the following: Room revenue , which is comprised of revenue realized from the sale of rooms at our hotels; Food and beverage revenue , which is comprised of revenue realized in the hotel food and beverage outlets as well as banquet and catering events; and Other operating revenue , which includes ancillary hotel revenue and other items primarily driven by occupancy such as telephone/internet, parking, spa, destination and resort fees, entertainment and other guest services. Additionally, this category includes, among other things, attrition and cancellation revenue, tenant revenue derived from hotel space and marina slips leased by third parties, winery revenue, any business interruption proceeds and any performance guarantee or reimbursements to offset net losses. Expenses. Our expenses consist of the following: Room expense , which is primarily driven by occupancy and, therefore, has a significant correlation with room revenue; Food and beverage expense , which is primarily driven by hotel food and beverage sales and banquet and catering bookings and, therefore, has a significant correlation with food and beverage revenue; Other operating expense , which includes the corresponding expense of other operating revenue, advertising and promotion, repairs and maintenance, utilities and franchise costs; Property tax, ground lease and insurance expense , which includes the expenses associated with property tax, ground lease and insurance payments, each of which is primarily a fixed expense, however property tax is subject to regular revaluations based on the specific tax regulations and practices of each municipality, along with our cash and noncash operating lease expenses, general excise tax assessed by Hawaii and taxes assessed on commercial rents by San Francisco and Texas; Other property-level expenses , which includes our property-level general and administrative expenses, such as payroll, benefits and other employee-related expenses, contract and professional fees, credit and collection expenses, employee recruitment, relocation and training expenses, labor dispute expenses, consulting fees, management fees and other expenses;

Operating Performance Indicators . The following performance indicators are commonly used in the hotel industry: Occupancy , which is the quotient of total rooms sold divided by total rooms available; Average daily room rate, or ADR, which is the quotient of room revenue divided by total rooms sold; Revenue per available room, or RevPAR, which is the product of occupancy and ADR, and does not include food and beverage revenue, or other operating revenue; RevPAR index, which is the quotient of a hotel s RevPAR divided by the average RevPAR of its competitors, multiplied by 100. A RevPAR index in excess of 100 indicates a hotel is achieving higher RevPAR than the average of its competitors. In addition to absolute RevPAR index, we monitor changes in RevPAR index; EBITDAre , which is net income excluding: interest expense; benefit or provision for income taxes, including any changes to deferred tax assets, liabilities or valuation allowances and income taxes applicable to the sale of assets; depreciation and amortization; gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change in control); and any impairment write-downs of depreciated property; Adjusted EBITDAre , which is EBITDA re adjusted to exclude: amortization of deferred stock compensation; amortization of contract intangibles; amortization of right-of-use assets and obligations; the impact of any gain or loss from undepreciated asset sales or property damage from natural disasters; any lawsuit settlement costs; the write-off of development costs associated with abandoned projects ; property-level restructuring, severance, and management transition costs; pre-opening costs associated with extensive renovation projects such as the work being performed at The Confidante Miami Beach; debt resolution costs; and any other nonrecurring identified adjustments;

Factors Affecting Our Operating Results. The primary factors affecting our operating results include overall demand for hotel rooms, the pace of new hotel development, or supply, and the relative performance of our operators in increasing revenue and controlling hotel operating expenses. Demand. The demand for lodging has traditionally been closely linked with the performance of the general economy. Our hotels are classified as either upper upscale or luxury hotels. In an economic downturn or recession, these types of hotels may be more susceptible to a decrease in revenue, as compared to hotels in other categories that have lower room rates in part because upper upscale and luxury hotels generally target business and leisure travelers at higher price points, and these groups may seek to curtail spending in periods of economic decline. In addition, operating results at our hotels in resort markets may be negatively affected by reduced demand from domestic travelers due in part to elevated demand for international travel in the post-pandemic-era, and by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to other currencies which may make international travel more affordable; whereas operating results at our hotels in key gateway markets may be negatively affected by reduced demand from international travelers due to financial conditions in their home countries or a material strengthening of the U.S. dollar in relation to other currencies which makes travel to the U.S. less affordable. Also, volatility in transportation fuel costs, increases in air and ground travel costs, decreases in airline capacity, and prolonged periods of inclement weather in our markets may reduce the demand for our hotels. Supply . The addition of new competitive hotels affects the ability of existing hotels to absorb demand for lodging and, therefore, impacts the ability to generate growth in RevPAR and profits. The development of new hotels is largely driven by construction costs, the cost and availability of financing, and the expected performance of existing hotels. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. hotel supply continued to increase, and some markets experienced new hotel room openings at or greater than historic levels. In the years since the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. hotel supply growth has been below historic levels in most markets as the cost of construction and the cost and availability of financing have not been conducive to the development of new hotels. Separate from the development of new hotels, an increase in the supply of vacation rental or sharing services such as Airbnb may negatively affect the ability of existing hotels to generate growth in RevPAR and profits. Revenues and expenses . We believe that marginal improvements in RevPAR index, even in the face of declining revenues, are a good indicator of the relative quality and appeal of our hotels, and our operators effectiveness in maximizing revenues. Similarly, we also evaluate our operators effectiveness in minimizing incremental operating expenses in the context of increasing revenues or, conversely, in reducing operating expenses in the context of declining revenues. Inflationary pressures could increase operating costs, which could limit our operators effectiveness in minimizing expenses.

 Summary of Operating Results . The following items significantly impact the year-over-year comparability of our operations: Hotel Renovations : During the first nine months of 2024, operations at The Confidante Miami Beach and the Renaissance Long Beach (the Two Renovation Hotels were negatively impacted by renovations as they transitioned to Andaz Miami Beach and the Marriott Long Beach Downtown, respectively. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023 and continuing into the first quarter of 2024, hotel amenities at The Confidante Miami Beach, including the pool, meeting space, and food and beverage outlets, were closed in phases in preparation for the hotel s temporary suspension of operations on March 25, 2024 to allow the extensive renovation work to be performed more efficiently. We expect the resort to resume operations as Andaz Miami Beach in February 2025. The Renaissance Long Beach converted to Marriott Long Beach Downtown in March 2024. Renovation work at the hotel continued through the end of the second quarter of 2024, and the hotel began to ramp-up operations in the third quarter of 2024. As a result of these two renovations, our revenues and operating expenses in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 are not comparable to the same periods in 2023. Hotel Disposition : In October 2023, we sold the Boston Park Plaza. As a result, our revenues, operating expenses, and depreciation expense in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 are not comparable to the same periods in 2023. Hotel Acquisition : In April 2024, we acquired the Hyatt Regency San Antonio Riverwalk. As a result, our revenues, operating expenses, and depreciation expense in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 are not comparable to the same periods in 2023. Room revenue . Room revenue decreased 19.7 million, or 12.4 , in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023 as follows: The sale of the Boston Park Plaza caused room revenue to decrease by 24.0 million. The Two Renovation Hotels caused room revenue to decrease by 3.3 million. Occupancy decreased 2,430 basis points; however, the average daily room rate increased 7.2 , reflecting Marriott Long Beach Downtown s post- conversion ramp-up in the third quarter of 2024. RevPAR decreased 33.6 .

Occupancy increased 250 basis points and the average daily room rate decreased 2.8 , resulting in a 0.7 increase in RevPAR. The Comparable Portfolio s room revenue was positively impacted by continued strength in group activity, as well as an acceleration in business travel. These positive impacts were partially reduced by the negative effects of a market-wide moderation in leisure demand in Maui and labor activity at the Hilton San Diego Bayfront, which led to the cancellation of certain group events and overall lower business volume at the hotel.

 Food and beverage revenue . Food and beverage revenue decreased 0.1 million, or 0.2 , in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023, as follows: The sale of the Boston Park Plaza caused food and beverage revenue to decrease by 7.2 million. 
 The Two Renovation Hotels caused food and beverage revenue to decrease by 1.4 million. Food and beverage revenue at the Comparable Portfolio increased 5.2 million due to increases in both banquet and outlet revenues, primarily due to increases in both group and transient occupancy. In addition, food and beverage revenue increased at the Wailea Beach Resort due to the negative impact of the wildfire in the third quarter of 2023, and at The Westin Washington, DC Downtown, which was under renovation in the prior year. These increases in food and beverage revenue were partially offset by decreases in both banquet and outlet revenue at the Hilton San Diego Bayfront due to labor activity at the hotel during the third quarter of 2024, which led to the cancellation of certain group events and overall lower business volume at the hotel. The acquisition of the Hyatt Regency San Antonio Riverwalk caused food and beverage revenue to increase by 3.2 million.

 Interest and other income . Interest and other income totaled 2.4 million and 1.2 million in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 11.3 million and 6.4 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, we recognized interest income of 2.3 million and 1.2 million, respectively. Interest income increased in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023 due to increases in our cash balances as well as increased interest rates. In addition, during the third quarter of 2024, we recognized other miscellaneous income of 0.1 million. During the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, we recognized interest income of 10.9 and 2.7 million, respectively.

Interest expense . We incurred interest expense as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Interest expense on debt 12,395 12,623 37,012 36,299 Noncash interest on derivatives, net 3,326 (1,469) 1,095 (3,348) Amortization of deferred financing costs 741 740 2,219 1,960 Capitalized interest (480) (641) Total interest expense 15,982 11,894 39,685 34,911

 Interest expense increased 4.1 million, or 34.4 , and 4.8 million, or 13.7 , in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase in interest expense during the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to a 4.8 million noncash change in the fair market value of our derivatives. This increase to expense was partially offset by 0.5 million in capitalized interest and a 0.2 million decrease in interest expense on our debt. During the third quarter of 2024, we capitalized 0.5 million of interest expense related to the extensive renovation work at The Confidante Miami Beach as it transitions to Andaz Miami Beach. Interest expense on our debt decreased 0.2 million primarily due to decreased interest on our variable rate debt. The increase in interest expense during the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to a 4.4 million noncash change in the fair market value of our derivatives. In addition, interest expense on our debt increased 0.7 million primarily due to increased interest on our variable rate debt and our draw of the 225.0 million available under our third term loan in May 2023, which was partially offset due to our repayment of the 220.0 million loan secured by the Hilton San Diego Bayfront in May 2023. The amortization of deferred financing costs caused interest expense to increase 0.3 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 due to costs incurred on our third term loan. These increases were partially offset by 0.6 million of interest capitalized related to the extensive renovation work at The Confidante Miami Beach as it transitions to Andaz Miami Beach. Our weighted average interest rate per annum, including our variable rate debt obligations and excluding capitalized interest, was approximately 5.7 and 5.8 at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Approximately 51.1 and 51.2 of our outstanding notes payable had fixed interest rates or had been swapped to fixed interest rates at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Gain on sale of assets, net . Gain on sale of assets, net totaled zero and 0.5 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, and zero for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2023. In the first quarter of 2024, we recognized an additional 0.5 million net gain related to a contingency resolution at a hotel sold in a prior year. Gain on extinguishment of debt . Gain on extinguishment of debt totaled zero and a nominal amount for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. In the third quarter of 2023, we recorded a nominal gain associated with reassessments of the remaining potential employee-related obligations held in escrow associated with our assignment of a hotel to the hotel s mortgage holder in 2020. For the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, gain on extinguishment of debt totaled 0.1 million and 9.9 million, respectively, both of which were related to the remaining potential employee-related obligations noted above in the discussion regarding the third quarter of 2023. During the first nine months of 2024, we recognized 21,000 due to reassessments of the remaining potential employee-related obligations held in escrow, and 38,000 due to the release of the remaining potential employee-related obligations in conjunction with the termination of the escrow agreement during the second quarter of 2024. During the first nine months of 2023 we recognized a gain of 9.9 million, comprised of 9.8 million from the relief of the majority of the potential employee-related obligations, with the funds released to us from escrow, and 0.1 million due to reassessments of the remaining potential employee-related obligations held in escrow. Income tax benefit (provision), net . We lease our hotels to the TRS Lessee and its subsidiaries, which are subject to federal and state income taxes. In addition, we and the Operating Partnership may also be subject to various state and local income taxes. In the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, we recognized net current income tax benefits of 0.5 million and 1.1 million, respectively, resulting from current state and federal income tax expenses, net of any refunds. In the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, we recognized current income tax provisions of 0.6 million and 1.8 million, respectively, resulting from current state and federal income tax expenses. Preferred stock dividends . Preferred stock dividends were incurred as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Series G preferred stock 745 40 1,739 1,204 Series H preferred stock 1,761 1,761 5,283 5,283 Series I preferred stock 1,425 1,425 4,275 4,275 Total preferred stock dividends 3,931 3,226 11,297 10,762 The Series G preferred stock initially accrued dividends at a rate equal to the Montage Healdsburg s annual net operating income yield on our total investment in the resort. In the first and third quarters of 2024, the annual dividend rate increased to the

Table of Contents 
 greater of 3.0 and 4.5 , respectively, or the rate equal to the Montage Healdsburg s annual net operating income yield on our total investment in the resort. Non-GAAP Financial Measures . We use the following non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to investors as key supplemental measures of our operating performance: EBITDA re; Adjusted EBITDA re ; FFO attributable to common stockholders; and Adjusted FFO attributable to common stockholders. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ). In addition, our calculation of these measures may not be comparable to other companies that do not define such terms exactly the same as the Company. These non-GAAP measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. They should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss), cash flow from operations, or any other operating performance measure prescribed by GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect additional ways of viewing our operations that we believe, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. We strongly encourage investors to review our financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure. We present EBITDA re in accordance with guidelines established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts Nareit ), as defined in its September 2017 white paper Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate. We believe EBITDA re is a useful performance measure to help investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period in comparison to our peers. Nareit defines EBITDA re as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) plus interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on the disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change in control), impairment write-downs of depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in the value of depreciated property in the affiliate, and adjustments to reflect the entity s share of EBITDA re of unconsolidated affiliates. We make additional adjustments to EBITDA re when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful information to investors regarding our operating performance, and that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA re , when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income, is beneficial to an investor s complete understanding of our operating performance. In addition, we use both EBITDA re and Adjusted EBITDA re as measures in determining the value of hotel acquisitions and dispositions. We adjust EBITDA re for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDA re : Amortization of deferred stock compensation : we exclude the noncash expense incurred with the amortization of deferred stock compensation as this expense is based on historical stock prices at the date of grant to our corporate employees and does not reflect the underlying performance of our hotels. Amortization of contract intangibles : we exclude the noncash amortization of any favorable or unfavorable contract intangibles recorded in conjunction with our hotel acquisitions. We exclude the noncash amortization of contract intangibles because it is based on historical cost accounting and is of lesser significance in evaluating our actual performance for the current period. Amortization of right-of-use assets and obligations : we exclude the amortization of our right-of-use assets and related lease obligations, as these expenses are based on historical cost accounting and do not reflect the actual rent amounts due to the respective lessors or the underlying performance of our hotels. Undepreciated asset transactions : we exclude the effect of gains and losses on the disposition of undepreciated assets because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDA re is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets. Gains or losses from debt transactions : we exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt, including the acceleration of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired because, like interest expense, their removal helps investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure. Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle : from time to time, the FASB promulgates new accounting standards that require the consolidated statement of operations to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. We exclude these one-time adjustments, which include the accounting impact from prior periods, because they do not reflect our actual performance for that period. Other adjustments : we exclude other adjustments that we believe are outside the ordinary course of business because we do not believe these costs reflect our actual performance for the period and/or the ongoing operations of our hotels. Such items may include: lawsuit settlement costs; the write-off of development costs associated with abandoned projects;

 property-level restructuring, severance, and management transition costs; pre-opening costs associated with extensive renovation projects such as the work being performed at The Confidante Miami Beach; debt resolution costs; lease terminations; property insurance restoration proceeds or uninsured losses; and other nonrecurring identified adjustments. The following table reconciles our unaudited net income to EBITDA re and Adjusted EBITDA re for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net income 3,249 15,558 42,426 79,723 Depreciation and amortization 31,689 33,188 91,841 97,927 Interest expense 15,982 11,894 39,685 34,911 Income tax (benefit) provision, net (483) 602 (1,083) 1,763 Gain on sale of assets, net (457) EBITDA re 50,437 61,242 172,412 214,324 Amortization of deferred stock compensation 2,430 2,511 8,381 8,263 Amortization of right-of-use assets and obligations (153) (13) (271) (82) Amortization of contract intangibles, net (19) (55) Gain on extinguishment of debt (9) (59) (9,930) Gain on insurance recoveries (314) (3,722) Pre-opening costs 853 1,452 Adjustments to EBITDA re , net 3,130 2,470 9,189 (5,526) Adjusted EBITDA re 53,567 63,712 181,601 208,798 Adjusted EBITDA re decreased 10.1 million, or 15.9 , in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023, and 27.2 million, or 13.0 , in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to the following: The Boston Park Plaza recorded Adjusted EBITDA re of 12.9 million and 26.6 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA re at the Two Renovation Hotels decreased 0.7 million, or 74.5 , and 15.6 million, or 119.2 , in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA re at the Comparable Portfolio decreased 0.8 million, or 1.6 , and 4.0 million, or 2.2 , in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to the changes in the Comparable Portfolio s revenues and expenses included in the discussion above regarding the operating results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024. The Hyatt Regency San Antonio Riverwalk recorded Adjusted EBITDA re of 4.0 million and 8.6 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively. We believe that the presentation of FFO attributable to common stockholders provides useful information to investors regarding our operating performance because it is a measure of our operations without regard to specified noncash items such as real estate depreciation and amortization, any real estate impairment loss and any gain or loss on sale of real estate assets, all of which are based on historical cost accounting and may be of lesser significance in evaluating our current performance. Our presentation of FFO attributable to common stockholders conforms to the Nareit definition of FFO applicable to common shares. Our presentation may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the terms in accordance with the current Nareit definition, or that interpret the current Nareit definition differently than we do. We also present Adjusted FFO attributable to common stockholders when evaluating our operating performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance and may facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and our peer companies. We adjust FFO attributable to common stockholders for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted FFO attributable to common stockholders: Amortization of deferred stock compensation : we exclude the noncash expense incurred with the amortization of deferred stock compensation as this expense is based on historical stock prices at the date of grant to our corporate employees and does not reflect the underlying performance of our hotels.

 Amortization of contract intangibles : we exclude the noncash amortization of any favorable or unfavorable contract intangibles recorded in conjunction with our hotel acquisitions. We exclude the noncash amortization of contract intangibles because it is based on historical cost accounting and is of lesser significance in evaluating our actual performance for the current period. Real estate amortization of right-of-use assets and obligations : we exclude the amortization of our real estate right-of-use assets and related lease obligations (with the exception of our corporate operating lease) as these expenses are based on historical cost accounting and do not reflect the actual rent amounts due to the respective lessors or the underlying performance of our hotels. Gains or losses from debt transactions : we exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt, including the acceleration of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired, as well as the noncash interest on our derivatives. We believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs. Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle : from time to time, the FASB promulgates new accounting standards that require the consolidated statement of operations to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. We exclude these one-time adjustments, which include the accounting impact from prior periods, because they do not reflect our actual performance for that period. Other adjustments : we exclude other adjustments that we believe are outside the ordinary course of business because we do not believe these costs reflect our actual performance for that period and/or the ongoing operations of our hotels. Such items may include: lawsuit settlement costs; the write-off of development costs associated with abandoned projects; changes to deferred tax assets, liabilities or valuation allowances; property-level restructuring, severance, and management transition costs; pre-opening costs associated with extensive renovation projects such as the work being performed at The Confidante Miami Beach; debt resolution costs; preferred stock redemption charges; lease terminations; property insurance restoration proceeds or uninsured losses; income tax benefits or provisions associated with the application of net operating loss carryforwards, uncertain tax positions or with the sale of assets; and other nonrecurring identified adjustments.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources During the periods presented, our sources of cash included our operating activities and working capital, as well as proceeds from our term loan, property insurance, and a hotel disposition deposit. Our primary uses of cash were for capital expenditures for hotels and other assets, an acquisition of a hotel, operating expenses, repurchases of our common stock, repayments of notes payable and dividends and distributions on our preferred and common stock. We cannot be certain that traditional sources of funds will be available in the future. Operating activities . Our net cash provided by or used in operating activities fluctuates primarily as a result of changes in the net cash generated by our hotels, offset by the cash paid for corporate expenses. Our net cash provided by or used in operating activities may also be affected by changes in our portfolio resulting from hotel acquisitions, dispositions or renovations. Net cash provided by operating activities was 139.9 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to 168.7 million in the first nine months of 2023. The net decrease in cash provided by operating activities during the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to decreases in operating cash at the Two Renovation Hotels, as well as decreases caused by our sale of the Boston Park Plaza and higher interest payments on our variable rate debt, partially offset by the acquisition of the Hyatt Regency San Antonio Riverwalk as well as additional operating cash provided by the increase in travel demand benefiting our hotels. Investing activities . Our net cash provided by or used in investing activities fluctuates primarily as a result of acquisitions, dispositions and renovations of hotels and other assets. Net cash used in investing activities during the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023 was as follows (in thousands): 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Acquisition of hotel property (229,330) Disposition deposit 10,000 Proceeds from property insurance 314 3,722 Renovations and additions to hotel properties and other assets (110,241) (73,944) Net cash used in investing activities (339,257) (60,222) During the first nine months of 2024, we paid 229.3 million to acquire the Hyatt Regency San Antonio Riverwalk, including closing costs and prorations and we invested 110.2 million for renovations and additions to our portfolio and other assets. These cash outflows were slightly offset by 0.3 million in property insurance proceeds received related to fire damage at the Hilton San Diego Bayfront. During the first nine months of 2023, we received a disposition deposit of 10.0 million from the buyer of the Boston Park Plaza, which we sold in October 2023, and we received insurance proceeds of 3.7 million for hurricane-related property damage at the Hilton New Orleans St. Charles. These cash inflows were offset by 73.9 million invested for renovations and additions to our portfolio and other assets. Financing activities . Our net cash provided by or used in financing activities fluctuates primarily as a result of our dividends and distributions paid, issuance and repurchase of common stock, issuance and repayment of notes payable and our credit facility, and issuance and redemption of other forms of capital, including preferred equity. Net cash used in financing activities during the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023 was as follows (in thousands): 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Acquisition of noncontrolling interest, including transaction costs (299) Payment of common stock offering costs (428) Repurchases of outstanding common stock (26,294) (35,523) Repurchases of common stock for employee tax obligations (4,160) (3,348) Proceeds from note payable 225,000 Payments on notes payable (1,613) (221,554) Payments of deferred financing costs (2,332) Dividends and distributions paid (69,697) (42,246) Net cash used in financing activities (101,764) (80,730) During the first nine months of 2024, we paid 26.3 million to repurchase 2,670,373 shares of our outstanding common stock, 4.2 million to repurchase common stock to satisfy the tax obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted common stock issued to employees, 1.6 million in scheduled principal payments on our loan secured by the JW Marriott New Orleans and 69.7 million in dividends and distributions to our preferred and common stockholders.

 During the first nine months of 2023, we paid an additional 0.3 million to true-up the total acquisition cost of the outside 25.0 equity interest in the entity that owns the Hilton San Diego Bayfront and 0.4 million in common stock offering costs related to our shelf registration statement. In addition, we paid 35.5 million to repurchase 3,827,759 shares of our outstanding common stock, 3.3 million to repurchase common stock to satisfy the tax obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted common stock issued to employees, and 42.2 million in dividends and distributions to our preferred and common stockholders. We also entered into a term loan agreement, receiving 225.0 million in proceeds and paying 2.3 million in related deferred financing costs. We utilized the proceeds received from the term loan to repay the 220.0 million loan secured by the Hilton San Diego Bayfront. We also paid 1.6 million in scheduled principal payments on our loan secured by the JW Marriott New Orleans. Future. We expect our primary sources of cash will continue to be our operating activities, working capital, borrowing under our credit facility, additional issuances of notes payable, dispositions of hotel properties and proceeds from offerings of common and preferred stock. However, there can be no assurance that our future asset sales, debt issuances or equity offerings will be successfully completed. As a result of potential increases in inflation rates and interest rates, as well as possible recessionary periods in the future, certain sources of capital may not be as readily available to us as they have in the past or may only be available at higher costs. We expect our primary uses of cash to be for operating expenses, capital investments in our hotels, repayment of principal on our notes payable and credit facility, interest expense, repurchases of our common stock, distributions on our common stock, dividends on our preferred stock and acquisitions of hotels or interests in hotels. In October 2024, we paid 0.2 million to repurchase 18,209 shares of our outstanding common stock, leaving 428.3 million available for repurchase under our stock repurchase program. While both inflation and interest rates began to decrease in the third quarter of 2024, the recent increases in inflation and interest rates have had a negative effect on our operations. We have experienced increases in wages, employee-related benefits, food costs, commodity costs, including those used to renovate or reposition our hotels, property taxes, property and liability insurance, utilities and borrowing costs. The ability of our hotel operators to adjust rates has mitigated the impact of increased operating costs on our financial position and results of operations. However, the increases in interest rates negatively affected our variable rate debt, resulting in increased interest payments during the first nine months of 2024. Cash Balance . As of September 30, 2024, our unrestricted cash balance was 115.5 million. We believe that our current unrestricted cash balance and our ability to draw the 500.0 million capacity available for borrowing under the unsecured revolving credit facility will enable us to successfully manage our Company. Debt. As of September 30, 2024, we had 817.4 million of debt, 192.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, and total assets of 3.1 billion. We believe that by maintaining appropriate debt levels, staggering maturity dates and maintaining a highly flexible structure, we will have lower capital costs than more highly leveraged companies, or companies with limited flexibility due to restrictive covenants. As of September 30, 2024, 51.1 of our outstanding debt had fixed interest rates or had been swapped to fixed interest rates, including the loan secured by the JW Marriott New Orleans, unsecured corporate-level Term Loan 1 and two unsecured corporate-level senior notes. The Company s floating rate debt as of September 30, 2024 included the 175.0 million unsecured corporate-level Term Loan 2 and the 225.0 million unsecured corporate-level Term Loan 3. On November 7, 2024, the Company entered into a new delayed draw 100.0 million term loan agreement with several financial institutions. The new term loan will bear interest pursuant to a leverage-based pricing grid ranging from 1.35 to 2.20 over the applicable adjusted term SOFR and we may elect to swap some or all of the loan balance to fixed rates. The new term loan has an initial term of one year with two six-month extension options at the Company s election, resulting in an extended maturity of November 7, 2026. The Company expects to fully draw the new term loan in early December and use most of the proceeds received to repay the loan secured by the JW Marriott New Orleans, which matures December 11, 2024 and is projected to have a balance of 72.1 million. We may in the future seek to obtain mortgages on one or more of our 14 unencumbered hotels (subject to certain provisions under our unsecured term loans and senior notes), all of which were held by subsidiaries whose interests were pledged to our credit facility as of September 30, 2024. Should we obtain secured financing on any of our unencumbered hotels, the amount of capital available through our credit facility or future unsecured borrowings may be reduced. Following the repayment of the loan secured by the JW Marriott New Orleans in December 2024, all of our hotels will be unencumbered and held by subsidiaries whose interests are pledged to our credit facility.

 Contractual Obligations . The following table summarizes our payment obligations and commitments as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands): Payment due by period Less Than 1 to 3 3 to 5 More than Total 1 year years years 5 years Notes payable (1) 817,437 72,437 465,000 280,000 Interest obligations on notes payable (1) (2) 118,560 44,365 66,927 7,268 Operating lease obligations, including imputed interest (3) 11,687 5,881 3,057 1,765 984 Construction commitments 79,339 79,339 Total 1,027,023 202,022 534,984 289,033 984 
 (1) Notes payable and interest obligations on notes payable include the 225.0 million unsecured Term Loan 3 assuming the Company has exercised its one-time option to extend the maturity of the loan from May 1, 2025 to May 1, 2026 upon payment of applicable fees and the satisfaction of certain customary conditions. (2) Interest is calculated based on the loan balances and variable rates, as applicable, at September 30, 2024, and includes the effect of our interest rate derivatives. (3) Operating lease obligations include the lease on our current corporate headquarters and the sublease on our former corporate headquarters. In addition, operating lease obligations include a ground lease that expires in 2071 and requires a reassessment of rent payments due after 2025, agreed upon by both us and the lessor; therefore, no amounts are included in the above table for this ground lease after 2025. Capital Expenditures and Reserve Funds We believe we maintain each of our hotels in good repair and condition and in general conformity with applicable franchise and management agreements, ground lease, laws and regulations. Our capital expenditures primarily relate to the ongoing maintenance of our hotels and are budgeted in the reserve accounts described in the following paragraph. We also incur capital expenditures for cyclical renovations, hotel repositionings and development. We invested 110.2 million and 73.9 million in our portfolio and other assets during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we have contractual construction commitments totaling 79.3 million for ongoing renovations. During the remainder of 2024, we will continue to incur significant capital expenditures as we complete the substantial renovation and rebranding of The Confidante Miami Beach to Andaz Miami Beach. If we renovate additional hotels in the future, our capital expenditures will likely increase. With respect to our hotels that are operated under management or franchise agreements with major national hotel brands and our hotel subject to a first mortgage lien, we are obligated to maintain an FF E reserve account for future planned and emergency-related capital expenditures at these hotels. The amount funded into each of these reserve accounts is determined pursuant to the management, franchise and loan agreements for each of the respective hotels, ranging between 2.0 and 5.5 of the respective hotel s applicable annual revenue. As of September 30, 2024, our balance sheet includes restricted cash of 76.4 million, which was held in FF E reserve accounts for future capital expenditures at the majority of our hotels. According to certain loan and management agreements, reserve funds are to be held by the lender or managers in restricted cash accounts, and we are not required to spend the entire amount in such reserve accounts each year. Inflation Inflation affects our expenses, including, without limitation, by increasing such costs as wages, employee-related benefits, food costs, commodity costs, including those used to renovate or reposition our hotels, property taxes, property and liability insurance, utilities and borrowing costs. We rely on our hotel operators to adjust room rates and pricing for hotel services to reflect the effects of inflation. However, previously contracted rates, competitive pressures or other factors may limit the ability of our operators to respond to inflation. As a result, our expenses may increase at higher rates than our revenue. Seasonality and Volatility As is typical of the lodging industry, we experience seasonality in our business. Demand at certain of our hotels is affected by seasonal business patterns that can cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenues. Quarterly revenue also may be adversely affected by renovations and repositionings, our managers effectiveness in generating business and by events beyond our control, such as economic and business conditions, including a U.S. recession or increased inflation, trade conflicts and tariffs, changes impacting global travel, regional or global economic slowdowns, any flu or disease-related pandemic that impacts travel or the ability to travel, weather patterns, the adverse effects of climate change, the threat of terrorism, terrorist events, civil unrest, government shutdowns, events that reduce the capacity or availability of air travel, increased

 competition from other hotels in our markets, new hotel supply or alternative lodging options and unexpected changes in business, commercial travel, leisure travel and tourism. Critical Accounting Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience, information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Impairment of investments in hotel properties . Impairment losses are recorded on investments in hotel properties to be held and used by us whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Factors we consider when assessing whether impairment indicators exist include, but are not limited to, hotel disposition strategy and hold period, a significant decline in operating results not related to renovations or repositioning, significant changes in the manner in which the Company uses the asset, physical damage to the property due to unforeseen events such as natural disasters, and other market and economic conditions. Recoverability of assets that will continue to be used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the related total future undiscounted net cash flows. If an asset s carrying value is not recoverable through those cash flows, the asset is considered to be impaired. The impairment is measured by the difference between the asset s carrying amount and its fair value. We perform a fair value assessment using valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows and comparable sales transactions in the market to estimate the fair value of the hotel and, if appropriate and available, current estimated net sales proceeds from pending offers. Our judgment is required in determining the discount rate, terminal capitalization rate, the estimated growth of revenues and expenses, revenue per available room and margins, as well as specific market and economic conditions. Acquisition-related assets and liabilities . The acquisition of a hotel property or other entity requires an analysis of the transaction to determine if it qualifies as the purchase of a business or an asset. If the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets, then the transaction is an asset acquisition. Transaction costs associated with asset acquisitions are capitalized and subsequently depreciated over the life of the related asset, while the same costs associated with a business combination are expensed as incurred and included in corporate overhead on our consolidated statements of operations. Also, given the subjectivity, business combinations are provided a one-year measurement period to adjust the provisional amounts recognized if the necessary information is not available by the end of the reporting period in which the acquisition occurs; whereas asset acquisitions are not subject to a measurement period. Accounting for the acquisition of a hotel property or other entity requires either allocating the purchase price to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in the transaction at their respective relative fair values for an asset acquisition or recording the assets and liabilities at their estimated fair values with any excess consideration above net assets going to goodwill for a business combination. The most difficult estimations of individual fair values are those involving long-lived assets, such as property, equipment and intangible assets, together with any finance or operating lease right-of-use assets and their related obligations. When we acquire a hotel property or other entity, we use all available information to make these fair value determinations, including discounted cash flow analyses, market comparable data and replacement cost data. In addition, we make significant estimations regarding capitalization rates, discount rates, average daily rates, revenue growth rates and occupancy. We also engage independent valuation specialists to assist in the fair value determinations of the long-lived assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The determination of fair value is subjective and is based in part on assumptions and estimates that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. Depreciation and amortization expense . Depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets. The life of the assets is based on a number of assumptions, including the cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish our hotels, as well as specific market and economic conditions. Hotel properties are depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives primarily ranging from five years to forty years for buildings and improvements and three years to twelve years for FF E. Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the length of the related agreement. While we believe our estimates are reasonable, a change in the estimated lives could affect depreciation expense and net income or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels. We have not changed the useful lives of any of our assets during the periods discussed.

 Income Taxes . To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we currently distribute at least 90 of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains) to our stockholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on that portion of our taxable income that is currently distributed to stockholders. We are subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and property, and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income. In addition, our wholly owned TRS, which leases our hotels from the Operating Partnership, is subject to federal and state income taxes. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases, and for net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted income tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled. The effect on the deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the new rate is enacted. However, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be realized based on consideration of all available evidence, including the future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies. Valuation allowances are provided if, based upon the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We review any uncertain tax positions and, if necessary, we will record the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions in the consolidated financial statements. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. We are required to analyze all open tax years, as defined by the statute of limitations, for all major jurisdictions, which includes federal and certain states. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk To the extent that we incur debt with variable interest rates, our future income, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates. Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. We have no derivative financial instruments held for trading purposes. We use derivative financial instruments, which are intended to manage interest rate risks on our floating rate debt. As of September 30, 2024, 51.1 of our debt obligations were fixed in nature or were subject to interest rate swap derivatives, which mitigates the effect of changes in interest rates on our cash interest payments. If the market rate of interest on our variable rate debt increases or decreases by 50 basis points, interest expense on an annualized basis would increase or decrease, respectively, our future consolidated earnings and cash flows by approximately 2.0 million based on the debt balances and variable rates at September 30, 2024. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Attached as exhibits to this Form 10-Q are the certifications required by Rule 13a-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This section includes information concerning the controls and control evaluations referred to in the certifications. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . Based upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures, our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. During our fiscal quarter to which this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relates, there has not occurred any change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
