 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 As at October 31, 2024 (Unaudited) 

revenues for the nine months ended October 31, 2024. The Company has had income in current year but has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenue sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses. The Company intends to position itself so that it will be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. Considering management s efforts, there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going concern.

that may be available to reduce future years taxable income in varying amounts indefinitely. Future tax benefits which may arise because of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards. 
 
 The income tax valuation allowance as of October 31, 2024, was approximately . The net change in income tax valuation allowance from January 31, 2024, through October 31, 2024, was . In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. 
 
 The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on consideration of these items, management has determined that enough uncertainty exists relative to the realization of the deferred income tax asset balances to warrant the application of a full valuation allowance as of October 31, 2024. All tax years since inception remain open for examination by taxing authorities.

Blockchain Developments: 
 As for our endeavours in blockchain technology, our two principal controllers have recently been awarded a patent for customized NFTs in early 2024, underscoring our commitment to intellectual property and innovation. Building on this momentum, our company has laid out plans for product development in the Web3 space this year, signalling our entrance into the next evolution of the internet with a focus on decentralized products and services. 
 
 In addition, Real World Assets (RWA), as a trending topic in blockchain, has seen the Company actively involved in three key areas: (1) research related to RWA compliance, (2) development of software infrastructure, and (3) identification of assets suitable for RWA tokenization.

Furthermore, we look forward to integrating and developing a comprehensive framework combining AI, FinTech, and blockchain, focusing on an AI-based algorithmic trading framework in the cryptocurrency market for proprietary trading. 
 
 REVENUE 
 
 The Company s plan for revenue is as such: 
 
 AI Revenue: 
 The Company's AI solutions for cross-border e-commerce clients are a major revenue driver. Services include selecting Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs), designing live-stream scripts, and creating short video content. As a TikTok Affiliate Partner (TAP) , TikTok Shop Partner (TSP), and part of TikTok s Creator Network, the Company earns a share of sales from e-commerce clients' TikTok shops as well as a share of the tip revenue from the TikTok creators live-streaming and live-streaming commissions from TikTok, ensuring stable income. In addition, as a secondary agency for the TikTok traffic ad placement. By providing the clients AI-assisted consulting services focused on ad placement strategy, the Company expects to generate revenue through consulting fees from clients and ad placement commissions from TikTok. 
 
 FinTech Revenue: 
 In the FinTech sector, our revenue comes from providing consulting services to cross-border e-commerce payment service providers. We also offer custom software development and white-label solutions. This comprehensive service model ensures a consistent revenue stream, aligning our financial success with the operational success of our clients. In addition, the Company is expanding its services to include the design, foundational software development, and operational support related to algorithmic trading, further diversifying its FinTech offerings. 
 
 Blockchain Revenue: 
 Revenue in the blockchain sphere is derived from development and consulting services for Web3 projects. Our deep expertise in this cutting-edge technology positions us as a valuable partner for clients looking to innovate in the decentralized digital space. Furthermore, the patents owned by our principal controllers, particularly in the area of customized NFTs, open up additional revenue channels through licensing fees. This intellectual property elevates our market standing and contributes to a robust financial model that capitalizes on the burgeoning interest in blockchain applications. In addition, the Company hopes to add revenue from consulting services and software development related to the design, issuance, management, operation, and compliance of Real World Assets (RWA). Moreover, the Company plans to enhance its blockchain revenue streams by engaging in proprietary cryptocurrency trading activities. 
 
 In summary, the Company s revenue is derived from a diversified mix of AI-driven solutions, FinTech services, and blockchain initiatives. Key sources include partnerships and consulting in the TikTok ecosystem, custom software development, algorithmic trading, and blockchain projects like Web3 development, NFT licensing, and RWA tokenization. These interconnected revenue streams, supported by our expertise and intellectual property, create a strong foundation for sustainable growth and profitability.

MARKETING 
 
 Our company's marketing strategy is uniquely crafted for each division AI, FinTech, and blockchain to leverage our strengths and maximize market penetration. 
 
 AI Marketing: 
 As a TikTok Affiliate Partner (TAP) and TikTok Shop Partner (TSP), the Company benefits from referrals within TikTok's active social network communities and direct promotions from TikTok. This partnership ensures a steady stream of potential clients. Additionally, by collaborating with Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) who have significant cross-border fan and client bases, the Company expects to consistently acquire new leads. In addition, being part of the TikTok Creator Network enables the Company to reach a vast number of TikTok current and potential creators. This has a positive impact on the Company's promotion of its live-streaming AI tools. For instance, by offering free AI tools to creators, the Company can encourage them to join its network, subsequently profiting from the live-streaming commissions from TikTok and tip revenue share from the creators. 
 
 PGEM also plays a crucial role in our business development. While providing entertainment marketing services to their clients, PGEM promotes our AI solutions, specifically those designed for cross-border e-commerce. This synergy enhances our market reach and drives further growth in our client base. 
 
 FinTech Marketing: 
 The Company collaborates with local law firms in Brazil to identify clients who provide cross-border e-commerce payment services. Through these partnerships, the Company offers its fintech services to these local clients. 
 
 Blockchain and Web3 Marketing: 
 Our blockchain services in the Web3 space benefit from our patented technologies, which enhance our reputation and attract clients. We use patent licensing entities to promote our capabilities, drawing in clients interested in advanced blockchain technology. 
 
 Our marketing strategy aligns with our operational strengths and market conditions, ensuring visibility and growth for each division. By leveraging existing relationships, intellectual property, and strategic partnerships, we expand our market presence and build a strong brand in our operating sectors. 
 
 COMPETITION 
 
 Our company operates in dynamic and competitive sectors, each with its unique set of challenges and opportunities. 
 
 AI Competitive Environment: 
 In the field of AI, particularly in entertainment marketing, our controlling team's rich experience and our collaborations with platforms like TikTok and YouTube provide us with significant competitive advantages. These partnerships grant us access to vast application scenarios and enable us to offer experienced and effective solutions. Despite these strengths, we recognize that competition in computational power and the experience of our R D personnel pose ongoing challenges. Continuous investment in these areas is essential to maintain our competitive edge and deliver the high-quality solutions our clients expect. 
 
 FinTech Competitive Dynamics: 
 The new algorithmic trading business builds upon the trading strategy designs and related expertise previously developed by Mr. Yitian Xue, the CEO of the Company. While these strategies and frameworks were originally designed for traditional stock and futures markets, adapting them to the cryptocurrency market presents unique challenges. The transition requires significant adjustments to account for the inherent volatility, 24/7 trading cycle, and decentralized nature of the crypto market. Additionally, the migration involves an extensive development timeline and considerable workload to reconfigure the algorithmic trading architecture to align with the technological and regulatory complexities of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Overcoming these challenges will be critical to establishing a competitive edge and ensuring the success of this new business line. 
 16 

Blockchain and Web3 Competition: 
 The blockchain, Web3, and NFT sectors are currently characterized by their lack of clear market direction, with all players seeking new opportunities and directions. This exploratory phase of the industry results in inherent instability that poses a challenge to our business operations. However, our approach to this uncertainty is to leverage our patented technologies and adaptability to serve as a stable partner to our clients during times of market flux. We remain vigilant and responsive to the evolving trends, ensuring that our offerings are aligned with the emerging needs and expectations of the marketplace. 
 
 In addition, the Company plans to enter the cryptocurrency proprietary trading market, which is inherently volatile and uncertain compared to traditional financial markets. This new venture will require time for adaptation, development, and refinement of trading strategies and systems before it can reach a mature and optimized operational state. Overcoming these challenges is essential to capturing opportunities in this rapidly evolving space. 
 
 In conclusion, while we face substantial competition in AI, FinTech, and blockchain sectors, our strategic partnerships, deep market experience, and innovative technologies provide us with robust tools to meet these challenges head-on. Our commitment to ongoing improvement and market adaptability positions us to not just compete but lead in our chosen markets.
