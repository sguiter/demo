million and used cash of million for operating
activities. At September 30, 2024, the Company has a cash balance of million and an accumulated deficit of million. 

The
continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon generating profit from its operations and its ability to obtain debt
or equity financing. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to generate sufficient profits, obtain such financings, or obtain
them on favorable terms, which could limit its operations. Any such financing activities are subject to market conditions. These uncertainties
cause substantial doubt to exist as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for 12 months from issuance of these
financial statements. These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification
of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern. These adjustments could be material. 

The
going concern assessment excludes the Company s at-the-market ATM offering (Note 13), which could provide sources of liquidity. 

Based
on our current operating plan, unless we generate income from the operations of our facilities or raise
additional capital (debt or equity), it is possible that we will be unable to maintain our financial covenants under our existing Note
agreement (Note 11). If such covenant violations are not waived by the Note holder, it would result in an event of default, causing an
acceleration of the outstanding balances. If we do raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings, as opposed to
debt or additional Note issuances, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders may be diluted. 

million as of and for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.
As certain of these awards are liability-classified, the correction of this error resulted in an increase of million in accounts
payable and accrued liabilities for the current portion of the awards, and an increase of million in additional paid-in capital
for the awards where the number of common share warrants or RSUs are fixed as of September 30, 2023.

The
Company also identified an error in application of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, related to the initial and subsequent
recognition of a freestanding call option in the Company s convertible notes that does not qualify for equity classification. ASC
815 requires bifurcation of the freestanding call option with subsequent changes in the fair value of the bifurcated derivative to be
recorded in earnings. At issuance of the convertible notes, the Company should have recognized a derivative liability and a corresponding
discount on the convertible notes resulting from bifurcation of the derivative, with subsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative
liability and accretion of the discount recorded in earnings. 

The
correction of this error resulted in an increase in amortization and accretion of financing costs expense of less than million for
the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 

The
Company has evaluated the effects of the correction detailed in the tables below on the previously issued consolidated financial statements,
individually and in the aggregate, in accordance with the guidance in ASC 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. 
The Company has concluded such corrections to be immaterial to its previously issued consolidated financial statements. While management
believes the effect of the error is immaterial to the Company s previously issued consolidated financial statements as of and for
the quarter ended September 30. 2023, the financial statement line items impacted by this error have been corrected.

In November 2024, the FASB Issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense
Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses. The amendments in this update require disclosures,
in the notes to financial statements, of specified information about certain costs and expenses. The amendment clarifies which certain
costs and expenses that are included in cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expense categories that should be disclosed
with qualitative descriptions of amounts that are not separately disaggregated quantitatively. Additionally, the amendment requires disclosure
of total amounts of selling expenses and an entity s definition of selling expense. The update will be effective for annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. The
Company is in the process of determining the effect this ASU will have on the disclosures contained in the notes to the consolidated financial

On
March 28, 2024, ABTC was selected for a tax credit for up to 
million through the Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credits program (48C). This tax credit was granted by the U.S. Department of
Treasury Internal Revenue Service following a highly competitive technical and economic review process performed by the U.S.DOE,
which evaluated the feasibility of applicant facilities to advance America s buildout of globally competitive critical
material recycling, processing, and refining infrastructure. This tax credit may be utilized both for the reimbursement of capital
expenditures spent to date and also future capital expenditures at ABTC s battery recycling facility in the Tahoe-Reno
Industrial Center (TRIC) in Storey County, Nevada. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has incurred qualifying expenditures for this tax credit but will not recognize
any amounts until it has reasonable assurance of compliance with the relevant standards. 

Also
on March 28, 2024, ABTC was selected for an additional tax credit of up to 
million through the 48C program, which may be used in support of the design and construction of a new commercial battery recycling

million
in proceeds received from the private placement, million
was received from related parties of the Company, including current employees and an immediate family member of the Chief Executive
Officer. The Company recognized common shares and warrants to purchase common shares with a total fair value of million,
compensation expense of million
and a loss on private placement of million
in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company recognized less than a million
loss on change in fair value of these liability-classified equity-linked financial instruments. As of September 30, 2024, derivative
liabilities totaling million
relate to the warrants held by the related parties in this transaction and are included in long-term liabilities in the condensed
consolidated balance sheets. 

For
the remaining private placement subscription agreements, the Company recognized the fair value of the warrants of 
million and a loss on private placement of million as of issuance, and a fair value of 
million as of September 30, 2024, with the loss on change in fair value of less than 
million recorded to change in fair value of liability-classified equity-linked contracts in the condensed consolidated statements
of operations. The associated derivative liability is included in long-term liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance
sheets. 

In
September 2024, the Company s convertible notes were amended to increase the conversion rate of the conversion option. See further
discussion at Note 11. Upon modification, the Company no longer had sufficient authorized shares to settle all equity-linked contracts
including the convertible notes upon a potential conversion and accordingly, the embedded conversion feature was bifurcated from the
convertible notes to be accounted for as a derivative liability. The Company calculated a fair value of the bifurcated conversion feature
of million as of the modification date and a fair value of million as of September 30, 2024, with the loss on change in fair
value of million recorded to change in fair value of liability-classified financial instruments in the condensed consolidated
statements of operations. The associated derivative liability is included in long-term liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance
sheets.

On
July 3, 2024, the Company and Mercuria Energy America, LLC agreed to resolve their respective disputes related to a Marketing Agreement
entered into in May 2023. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the Company agreed to make six monthly payments to Mercuria Energy
America, LLC of million. Upon the completion of the payments, the parties agreed to release any and all claims, disputes, actions,
suits, proceedings, demands and/or liabilities in law and/or equity or otherwise. The total amount of payments due of million was
accrued as of June 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, million remained unpaid. 

million, comprised of (i) an initial term loan in the
aggregate principal amount of million and (ii) delayed draw term loan commitments in an aggregate amount equal to million. . The agreement contains provisions that allow the Company to remit principal and interest payments via future delivery of
its initial recycling byproduct, black mass. 

On
August 30, 2023, the Company caused the repayment in full of all indebtedness, liabilities and other obligations under, and terminated
the Credit Agreement
The Company did not incur any material early termination penalties because of such termination of the credit agreement. 

On
August 29, 2023, the Company and High Trail (the Buyers entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Purchase
Agreement ), pursuant to which the Company sold to the Buyers up to million of a new series of senior secured convertible
notes (the Notes ). To date, million has been received and million has been repaid. The remaining million
under the facility includes million with the condition that the Company started trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market, had 
in sales, and establish an ATM or ELOC, and another million at the discretion of the Buyers. Buyers may request partial redemptions
of up to an aggregate of million on the 15 th of each month or may convert the Notes into shares of common stock of the
Company Conversion Shares at a conversion rate of of the last reported sales price on the date of the agreement
to acquire such Notes. The Notes bear zero coupon, mature on , require a minimum of million maintained in cash
and cash equivalents, and are secured by certain real property and cash and investment accounts of the Company. 

The
Company analyzed the conversion features of the Notes for derivative accounting considerations under ASC 815-15, Derivatives and
Hedging, and determined a freestanding call option should be bifurcated and separately accounted for as a derivative liability. Accordingly,
the derivative liability is carried at fair value at each reporting date with the corresponding gain or loss reflected in earnings in
the condensed consolidated statements of operations. See Correction of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements in
Note 3. The Company determined the derivative liability to have a fair value of million at issuance of the Notes. For the three
months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a gain of million within the change in fair value of the derivative
liability in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the derivative liability
was determined to be nil given the expiration of the freestanding call option on October 1, 2024. 

Note
discount and issuance costs totaled million and reduced the carrying value of the Notes as a debt discount. The carrying value,
net of debt discount and issuance costs, is being accreted over the term of the Notes from date of issuance to date of full repayment,
expected to be in October 2024 based on partial redemption payments, using the effective interest rate method. For the three months ended
September 30, 2024, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs totaled million. 

On
September 13, 2024, the Notes were amended to allow payment of principal totaling 
million in common shares of the Company in lieu of cash, with the remaining principal due in September 2024 deferred to October
2024. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, further payment on the Notes has been deferred by the Buyers while negotiations on a
potential amendment to the Notes are on-going. Total common shares of 
were issued with a fair market value of 
million. The Notes were also amended to increase the conversion option rate. The Company concluded that the amendment to the Notes
was an extinguishment for accounting purposes due to the increase in the conversion option fair value. The Company recognized a
 
million loss on extinguishment in the condensed consolidated statement of operations, comprised of the write-off of the remaining
debt discount and debt issuance costs of 
million and the excess of fair value of the common shares paid in lieu of cash over the principal owed of 
million.

Three
months ended September 30, 2024: 

During
the period the Company issued 
 common shares upon vesting of share-based awards. 

On
April 3, 2024, the Company entered into an ATM sales agreement with Virtu Americas LLC, pursuant to which the Company may
offer and sell, from time to time through the sales agent, shares (the Shares of the Company s common stock,
par value per share, having an aggregate offering price of up to , subject to the terms and conditions of the Sales
Agreement. On September 30, 2024, the Company filed a prospectus supplement to its registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-252492)
offering the Shares. During the period, the Company sold common
shares, related to the ATM sales agreement, for total proceeds of million,
of which million
is recorded as a subscription receivable on the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024. In addition, the Company settled the issuance of common shares for a total of million that was included
in subscriptions receivable as of June 30, 2024. 

On
August 1, 2024, the Company agreed to sell in
a private placement Group A Units (defined below) to several accredited investors and 23 Group B Units to the Company s new
Chief Operating Officer, to an immediate family member of the Chief Executive Officer, and to two current employees, a portion of which
was rescinded on November 12, 2024, resulting in the sale of a total of only 18 Group A Units and 23 Group B Units in such private placement.
Each Group A Unit consists of shares
of Common Stock, Series
A warrants with a five-year term to purchase Common Stock Series A Warrants and Series
B Warrants with an 18-month term to purchase Common Stock (collectively with the Series A Warrants, the Warrants with
a purchase price of 
 per
Unit; each Group B Unit consists of shares
of Common Stock and Series
A Warrants with a five-year term and a purchase price of U.S. per
Unit. The Company received an initial payment of approximately 1.9 million but after the recission retained only an aggregate purchase
price of 
 million.
The recission is an event that will be accounted for as part of the second quarter results. 

Upon issuance, the Company concluded that it had insufficient authorized
shares to settle the warrants (see Note 6). As the warrants are therefore liability-classified and remeasured at fair value each reporting
period, the Company allocated the proceeds first to the warrants with any residual proceeds allocated to the common shares. A day-one loss is recognized to the extent
the recognized fair value of common shares and warrants exceeds the proceeds received. 

During
the period, the Company issued 
 common shares pursuant to the debt conversion option in lieu of cash payment of million (see Note 11). The fair value of the common shares
issued of million was recorded in additional paid-in
capital for this transaction. 

On
July 22, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized and approved to extend the expiration date to April
 30, 2025 for 
 certain warrants with an exercise price of 
 issued in connection with a previous equity offering
which were previously scheduled to expire on October 31, 2024. Of the 
 warrants, 
 warrants are held by Ryan Melsert, Chief Executive
Officer. The modification of the warrants resulted in incremental fair value of 
 million as of the modification date, of which
less than 
 million was recognized as stock-based compensation
expense for those warrants held by the Chief Executive Officer and the remainder as a deemed dividend per the requirements of ASC 815-40,
 Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity. The Company utilized a Black-Scholes option-pricing
model to determine the incremental fair value with assumptions including volatility of 
and a risk-free rate of . 

During
the period, the Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of million, which was an increase to additional paid-in capital
of million and an increase to the equity compensation liability of million. Stock-based compensation expense also included
the million related to the excess fair value related to warrants issued to the Insiders and the incremental fair value from modification
of certain warrants discussed above.

Overview 

American
Battery Technology Company (the Company is a growth company within the lithium ion battery industry that is working to
increase the domestic U.S. production of battery materials, such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese through its exploration of
new domestic-US primary resources of battery metals, development and commercialization of new technologies for the extraction of these
battery metals from primary resources, and commercialization of an internally developed integrated process for the recycling of lithium ion
batteries. Through this three pronged approach the Company is working to both increase the domestic production of these battery
materials, and to ensure spent batteries have their elemental battery metals returned to the domestic manufacturing supply chain in an
economical, environmentally-conscious, closed loop fashion. 

To
implement this business strategy, the Company has constructed its first integrated lithium ion battery recycling facility, which
takes in waste and end of life battery materials from the electric vehicle, stationary storage, and consumer electronics
industries. The ramp-up and operations of this facility are of the highest priority to the Company, and as such it has significantly
increased the resources devoted to its execution including the further internal hiring of technical staff, expansion of laboratory facilities,
and purchasing of equipment. The Company has been awarded a competitively bid grant from the U.S. Advanced Battery Consortium to support
a 2 million project to accelerate the development and demonstration of the technologies within this integrated lithium ion battery
recycling facility. The Company has also been awarded an additional grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to support a 20 million
project under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to validate, test, and deploy three next-generation disruptive advanced separation and
processing recycling technologies. 

Additionally,
the Company is accelerating the demonstration and commercialization of its internally developed low cost and
low environmental impact processing train for the manufacturing of battery grade lithium hydroxide from Nevada based
sedimentary claystone resources. The Company has been awarded a competitive grant from the U.S. Department of
Energy s Advanced Manufacturing and Materials Technologies Office through the Critical Materials Innovation program to support
a 4.5 million project for the construction and operation of a multi ton per day integrated continuous demonstration system to
support the scale up and commercialization of these technologies. The Company has also been awarded an additional grant award
under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to support a 115 million project to design, construct, and commission a first-of-kind
commercial-scale refinery to produce 30,000 MT of battery-grade lithium hydroxide per year from this resource. 

19 

ABTC
has completed the construction and commissioning of its claystone to lithium hydroxide (LiOH) pilot plant, marking a significant
milestone in the commercialization of its internally-developed processes to access an unrealized domestic primary lithium resource.
The construction and commissioning of this pilot plant enables ABTC to demonstrate its technologies for accessing the lithium housed
in its unconventional resource, Tonopah Lithium Flats Project (TFLP), in an integrated and continuous system, and to generate large
amounts of battery grade lithium hydroxide for delivery to customers for qualifications and evaluation. The construction and
operation of this pilot demonstration plant are supported by a competitively awarded grant from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)
for this 4.5 million effort. Product from the pilot plant is being sent for analysis to confirm and validate the resource. 

ABTC
has filed an amended Initial Assessment for its Tonopah Flats Lithium Project (TFLP). The TFLP is one of the largest identified lithium
resources in the U.S., and while initial pit designs and economic analyses in previous assessments evaluated the full resource, this
updated Initial Assessment utilizes a commercialization pathway with a more rigorous mine plan that contemplates utilization of only
Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources, and excludes Inferred Mineral Resources, to supply the planned commercial-scale lithium hydroxide refinery. This commercialization pathway allows for an engineered phased development, with improved access to the higher
quality portions of the resource, and at improved project economics. 

On
March 28, 2024, ABTC was selected for an approximately 19.5 million tax credit through the Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credits
program (48C). This tax credit was granted by the U.S. Department of Treasury Internal Revenue Service following a highly competitive
technical and economic review process performed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), which evaluated the feasibility of applicant
facilities to advance America s buildout of globally competitive critical material recycling, processing, and refining infrastructure.
This 19.5 million tax credit can be utilized both for the reimbursement of capital expenditures spent to date, and also for equipment
and infrastructure for additional value-add operations at ABTC s battery recycling facility in the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center
(TRIC) in Storey County, Nevada. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has incurred qualifying expenditures for this tax credit but will not recognize
any amounts until it has reasonable assurance of compliance with the relevant standards. The Company intends to sell the credit in order to monetize it s
value. 

Also
on March 28, 2024, ABTC was selected for an additional 40.5 million tax credit through the Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credits
program (48C) to support the design and construction of a new, next-generation, commercial battery recycling facility to be located in
the United States. As with ABTC s initial 19.5 million tax credit under the 48C program supporting the construction and buildout
of its battery recycling facility in Nevada, this additional award was granted by the U.S. Department of Treasury Internal Revenue Service
following a highly competitive technical and economic review process performed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), which evaluated
the feasibility of applicant facilities to advance America s buildout of globally competitive critical material recycling, processing,
and refining infrastructure. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not incurred any qualifying expenditures towards this tax credit. 

Financial
Highlights: 

Revenues were 202,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, following the Company s initial recognition
of revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. 

Cash COGS was 1.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, after the removal of non-cash items such
as depreciation expense and stock-based compensation. 

On September 23, 2024, the Company was selected for a new highly competitive grant from the US DOE for 150 million
in federal funding to construct a second lithium-ion battery recycling facility. 

Government
 grant reimbursement was 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.5 million during the same period
 of the prior year. Out of the current period s 1.4 million in grant funding, 0.3 million was recorded as an offset to fixed
 assets, as reimbursements related to equipment purchases, and 0.8 million was recorded as an offset to research and development
 costs within the condensed consolidated statement of operations. 

As

Components
of Statements of Operations 

Revenue 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, our revenue was 0.2 million. This is related to the sale of our recycled products produced from recycling operations
and followed our initial revenue generated by the Company in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. The materials were sold to a customer
who took delivery at our plant and the materials will remain at our plant to be further processed when phase two of the plant is complete. 

Cost of Goods Sold 

Cost of goods
sold during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.5 million. After the removal of non-cash items of 1.2 million such as depreciation
expense of 1.1 million and stock-based compensation of 0.1 million, cash cost of goods sold was 1.3 million. The high cost of goods
sold is related to the depreciation of the recycling facility fixed assets in the amount of 1.1 million, which is time based, and the
finalization of the production process. We expect these costs to continue to rise on an absolute basis but will be reduced as a percentage
of revenue as we scale our production and sales and gain efficiencies in the production process. In Q4 of fiscal 2024, the Company generated
its first revenue and started to record cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold during the three months ended June 30, 2024 was 3.3 million
of which 1.3 million was related to depreciation expense and 0.2 million was related to stock-based compensation. Cash cost of goods
sold for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was 1.8 million. 

Operating
Expenses 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred 7.5 million of operating expenses compared to 8.0 million during
the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

General
and administrative expenses consist of stock-based compensation, office expenses, legal, recruitment, business development, public relations,
and general facility expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses were 5.0 million,
an increase of 1.9 million over the same period in the prior year primarily related to increased stock-based compensation, personnel costs, audit
and insurance costs. 

Research
and development expenses consist primarily of laboratory leases, supplies, salaries, stock-based compensation, and employee benefits.
Research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 2.0 million and 3.6 million, respectively.
The decrease is primarily due to allocation of such costs to cost of goods sold and inventory as part of phase 1 recycling operations coming online
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. These costs are partially offset by federal grant funds for awards that
it has contracted with various federal agencies. The Company recognized an offset to its research and development costs of 0.8 million
and 0.5 million related to these awards for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively. 

Exploration
costs consist primarily of drilling, assay, claim fees, personnel, stock-based compensation, office and warehouse costs, travel, and
other costs related to exploration of claims in central Nevada. Exploration expenses totaled 0.4 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2024 compared to 1.4 million during the same period in the prior year. The decrease year-over-year resulted
principally from higher costs in prior year related to drilling, assaying and engineering to further define and potentially
upgrade the geological classification of the mineral rights. 

Other
Income (Expense) 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded other expense of 1.9 million, including 1.2 million for
amortization of debt financing costs, 0.7 million loss on debt extinguishment, 0.6 million loss on private placement and 0.2
million for change in fair value of liability classified instruments; offset by other income of 0.7 million for change in fair
value of derivative liability and 0.1 million for interest income. 

Net
Loss 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of 11.8 million or 0.17 loss per share compared to a net loss of
 8.9 million, or 0.19 loss per share, during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

At
September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of 5.8 million and total assets of 73.8 million compared to cash of 7.0 million and total assets of 77.7 million at June 30, 2024. The decrease of cash is due to normal transactional activities related to plant production and paydown of debt obligation. 

The
Company had total current liabilities of 10.0 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 15.8 million
at June 30, 2024. The decrease related to paydown of debt and timing of payments for accounts payable and accrued expenses. 

As
of September 30, 2024 the Company had working capital of 5.5 million compared to 2.6 million at June 30, 2024. The positive
working capital at the end of both periods results from the classification of 8.4 million of held-for-sale assets as current at
September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024. Absent this classification, the working capital deficiency would have been 2.9 million and
 5.8 million at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. 

The
continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon generating profit from its operations and its ability to obtain debt
or equity financing. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to generate sufficient profits, obtain such financings, or obtain
them on favorable terms, which could limit its operations. Any such financing activities are subject to market conditions. These uncertainties
cause substantial doubt to exist as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for 12 months from issuance of these
financial statements. These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification
of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern. These adjustments could be material. 

The
going concern assessment excludes the Company s at-the-market ATM offering, which could provide sources of liquidity. 

Based
on our current operating plan, unless we generate income from the operations of our facilities or raise additional capital (debt or equity),
it is possible that we will be unable to maintain our financial covenants under our existing Note agreement. If such covenant violations
are not waived by the Note holder, it would result in an event of default, causing an acceleration of the outstanding balances. If we
do raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings, as opposed to debt or additional Note issuances, the ownership
interest of our existing stockholders may be diluted.

Cash
from Operating Activities. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company used 5.5 million of cash for operating activities, compared to 4.8 million
cash used during the three months ended September 30, 2023. In both periods, the cash used has supported an increased scale of operations including employee headcount and personnel costs, production, and, administrative costs related to insurance, legal and accounting. 

Cash
from Investing Activities 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company used cash in investing activities of 0.9 million for acquisition of property and equipment for its recycling facilities. This is in comparison to cash used in investing activities of
 7.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is due to the Company purchasing more equipment in the beginning stages of the plant build-out in prior
year. 

Cash
from Financing Activities 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had cash provided by financing activities of 5.2 million, compared to 15.1
million provided during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company has relied on equity and debt financings to support
the increased operating activities, and the ramp up of the recycling plant, development of the lithium ore pilot plant, and upgrades
to the geological category of its Tonopah claims through additional studies and assessments. 

The
Company had proceeds from equity financings of 8.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.4 million in
the prior year period. The reduction in cash provided by financing activities in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared
to the prior year results from the paydown of notes payable of 3.6 million without any borrowings while, in the 2023 period, the
Company had net borrowings of 12.7 million.

Financing 

We
will continue to rely on sales of our common shares, debt, or other financing to fund our business operations as needed beyond any revenue
generated from internal operations and the government tax credits and grants that offset research development expenses, and capital
expenditures. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve
any additional sales of the securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund planned operating activities, acquisitions and
exploration activities.

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

Our
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of the condensed consolidated
financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing
basis using historical experience and other factors and adjust those estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate.
Actual results could differ materially from those estimates and assumptions. 

While some of our significant accounting policies are more fully described
in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements in
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, all our critical accounting policies and significant estimates are detailed in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024.

Controls
and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
 Exchange Act ). Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that the information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) is recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we
file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and
our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating
the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated,
can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily applies
its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 

The
Company s management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, carried
out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this report. Based on
such evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024,
the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, based on the material weaknesses described below. 

Material
Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act). Management, with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
under the oversight of our Board of Directors, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September
30, 2024 based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework (2013 Framework). Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our internal control over
financial reporting was not effective, due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, described below. 

Internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
the individuals serving as our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis. 

The
Company did not have a sufficient complement of personnel with appropriate technical expertise to perform an effective risk assessment.
In addition, the Company did not maintain proper segregation of duties related to accounting processes. As a consequence, internal control
deficiencies related to the design and operation of process-level controls were determined to be pervasive throughout the Company s
financial reporting processes. While these material weaknesses did result in immaterial misstatements of the Company s consolidated
financial statements, these material weaknesses create a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of account balances or disclosures
in the consolidated financial statements may not be prevented or detected in a timely manner. Therefore, we concluded that the deficiencies
represent material weaknesses in the Company s internal control over financial reporting and our internal control over financial
reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

24 

Remediation
Plan 

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, remediation efforts included removing accounting personnel access to both create and
post a journal entry, moving the systems administration tasks to personnel outside of the accounting department, and adding review procedures
by qualified personnel over complex accounting matters by way of engaging third-party professionals with whom to consult regarding complex
accounting applications and valuations. However, there is no guarantee that these measures will remediate the material weaknesses described
above. 

In addition to
the above steps taken, in July 2024, we hired a new corporate controller with extensive experience in technical accounting, SEC
reporting and internal control over financial reporting. In October 2024, we hired a senior accountant with public accounting and
public company reporting experience, which will help to mitigate segregation of duties weakness. We plan to continue to utilize an
outside CPA firm for technical expertise and we plan to perform a complete risk assessment to update our control procedures. These
additional steps will help mitigate the technical expertise weakness, the segregation of duties weakness and identify any other areas of risk to be incorporated in our
overall internal control plan. We expect to remediate these material weaknesses by the end of fiscal year 2025. 

We
are committed to ensuring that our internal control over financial reporting is designed and operating effectively. While we believe
procedures are in place as of September 30, 2024 to address the material weaknesses, remediation steps are required to be in place and
effective for an adequate period of time. We cannot provide assurance that such material weaknesses will be remediated, and we may discover
additional material weaknesses that may require additional time and resources to remediate. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Except
as noted above with respect to the completion of certain steps in the remediation plan, there was no change in our internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter covered
by this Interim Report on Form 10 Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting. 

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

We
may be involved in certain routine legal proceedings from time to time before various courts and governmental agencies. We cannot predict
the final disposition of such proceedings. We regularly review legal matters and record provisions for claims considered probable of
loss. The resolution of these pending proceedings is not expected to have a material effect on our operations or consolidated financial
statements in the period in which they are resolved. 

On
September 24, 2024, the Company filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada, Case No. 3:24-cv-00434, asserting
claims against Tysadco Partners, LLC Tysadco for amounts due and owing under March 16, 2024, March 21, 2024, and March
31, 2024, purchase agreements between Tysadco and the Company related to a Prospectus Supplement for the sale of Company stock. The Company
promptly fulfilled its obligations under the Purchase Agreements by issuing the agreed upon shares of its common stock. However, to date
Tysadco has only made partial payments to the Company under the purchase agreements, with the remaining 1,415,804.65 still unpaid. 
The Company intends to vigorously pursue its remedies against Tysadco for its nonpayment. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

Our
business is subject to various risks, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
June 30, 2024. There have been changes to the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
June 30, 2024 under Item 1A - Risk Factors as noted below. 

An
investment in the Company s securities is subject to a number of risks at any given time. Below is a description of the principal
risk factors affecting the Company. The risk factors set out below are not exhaustive and unidentified risks may have potential to adversely
affect the Company s financial condition, operating results, business or future prospects. Investors should carefully consider
these risk factors, many of which are beyond the Company s control, together with other disclosures and market information before
investing in the Company s securities. 

25 

Pre-Commercialization
Company Risks 

Because
we have not yet achieved full commercialization, a company like ours is inherently subject to many risks. These risks and difficulties
include (a) significant capital requirements and challenges with respect to obtaining financing until we can achieve full commercialization;
(b) accumulated and continuing losses; (c) challenges in accurate financial planning; (d) uncertainties resulting from a relatively limited
time period in which to develop and evaluate business strategies as compared to companies with longer operating histories; (e) cost and
complexity of compliance with significant regulations in connection with our operations and products; (f) reliance on third parties for
consulting, laboratory work, regulatory, commercialization or other activities; (g) reliance on third parties to carry out contractual
arrangements; and (h) meeting the challenges of the other risk factors described herein. We are subject to all risks incident to an emerging
company. 

Working
Capital Risks 

We
will need additional financing to execute our business plan and fund operations, which additional financing may not be available on reasonable
terms or at all. We will need to raise capital over the next 12 months to satisfy such requirements, the receipt of which cannot be assured.
We will also require capital in order to fully develop our recycling, extraction and refining operations. We intend to seek additional
funds through various financing sources, including the private sale of our equity and debt securities, potential joint ventures with
capital partners, grants, government loans, and project financing of our recycling facilities. However, there can be no guarantees that
such funds will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we
may be unable to further pursue our business plan and we may be unable to continue operations, in which case you may lose your entire
investment. 

Risks
of Competitive Industry 

Inherent
to competitive industries, there are risks the Company may be unable to maintain or acquire financing, seek available opportunities,
retain existing personnel or hire new personnel, or maintain or acquire technical or other resources, supplies or equipment, all on terms
it considers acceptable to complete the development of its projects. Battery recycling is a highly competitive and speculative business.
Competing recycling processes and facilities are primarily located in the United States, Europe, and China and employ various techniques
for extraction of the contained battery metals. In seeking available opportunities, we will compete with a number of other companies,
including established, multi-national companies that have more experience and resources than we do. There also may be other small companies
that are developing similar processes and are farther along than the Company. Because we may not have the financial and managerial resources
to compete with other companies, we may not be successful in our efforts to develop technology which is commercially viable. 

Business
Model Risks 

We
intend to engage in the business of lithium recycling through proprietary recycling technology. While the production of lithium-ion recycling
is an established business, to date most lithium-ion recycling has been produced by way of performing bulk high temperature calcinations
or bulk acid dissolutions. We have developed a highly strategic recycling processing train that does not employ any high temperature
operations or any bulk chemical treatments of the full battery. We have tested our recycling process on a small scale and to a limited
degree; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to produce battery metals in commercial quantities at a cost of production
that will provide us with an adequate profit margin. The uniqueness of our process presents potential risks associated with the development
of a business model that is untried and unproven as we undertake the build-out and operation of a large-scale facility capable of recycling
commercial quantities. There can be no assurance that as we commence large scale manufacturing or operations that we will not incur unexpected
costs or hurdles that might restrict the desired scale of our intended operations or negatively impact our projected gross profit margin. 

Share
Price Risks 

The
market price of the stock of a publicly traded company is affected by a number of variables, many of which are outside the Company s
control. Such factors include: the general condition of markets for resource stocks, and particularly for stocks of lithium exploration
and development companies and other battery-metals stocks; the general strength of the economy; the availability and attractiveness of
alternative investments; analysts recommendations and their estimates of financial performance; investor perception and reactions
to disclosures made by the Company, and by the Company s competitors; future securities sales; reputational risks of the Company;
and the breadth of the public markets for the stock. Investors could suffer significant losses if the Company s common stock is
depressed or illiquid when an investor seeks liquidity. 

26 

Market
Risks 

The
Company is exposed to commodity price movements for the inventory it holds and the products it plans to produce. Commodity price risk
management activities are currently limited to monitoring market prices. The Company s future revenues, if any, are sensitive to
the market prices of the metals contained in its planned products. 

The
Company s projects are highly dependent on the demand for and uses of lithium-based end products. This includes lithium-ion batteries
for electric vehicles and other large format batteries that currently have limited market share and whose projected adoption rates are
not assured. To the extent that such markets do not develop in the manner contemplated by the Company, then the long-term growth in the
market for lithium products will be adversely affected. This would inhibit the potential for development of the projects, their potential
commercial viability and would otherwise have a negative effect on the business and financial condition of the Company. In addition,
as a commodity, lithium market demand is subject to the substitution effect in which end-users adopt an alternate commodity as a response
to supply constraints or increases in market pricing. These circumstances could limit the quantity of customers and prices paid for our
products. To the extent that these factors arise in the market for lithium, it could have a negative impact on overall prospects for
growth of the lithium market and pricing, which in turn could have a negative effect on the Company and its projects. 

Product
Price and Quality Risks 

The
ability to reach and sustain profitable operations on the recycling and extraction projects, if and to the extent the projects are developed
and enter full commercial operation, will be significantly affected by changes in the market price of lithium-based end products. The
market price of these products fluctuates widely and is affected by numerous factors beyond the Company s control, including world
supply and demand, pricing characteristics for alternate energy sources such as oil and gas, government policy and laws, interest rates,
the rate of inflation and the stability of currency exchange rates, and other geopolitical and global economic factors. Such external
economic factors are influenced by changes in international investment patterns, various political developments and macro-economic circumstances.
Furthermore, the price of lithium products is significantly affected by their purity and performance, and by the specifications of end-user
battery manufacturers. If the products produced from the Company s projects do not meet battery-grade quality and/or do not meet
customer specifications, pricing will be reduced from that expected for battery-grade product. In turn, the company may lose or fail
to attract customers. The Company may not be able to effectively mitigate pricing risks for its products. Depressed pricing for the Company s
products will affect the level of revenues expected to be generated by the Company, which in turn could affect the value of the Company,
its share price and the potential value of its properties. 

Project
and Process Risks 

The
processes contemplated by the Company for refining of extracted materials and refining of recycled materials have not previously been
demonstrated at commercial scale. There are risks that efficiencies of recovery and throughput capacity will not be met, and risks that
scaled production will not be cost effective or operate as expected. In addition, there is potential for unforeseen costs, additional
changes to the process chemistry and engineering, and other unforeseen circumstances that could result in delays to the projects or increased
capital or operating costs. 

The
Company is in the process of exploring and assessing a mineral resource in Tonopah, Nevada, with the intent of progressing the project
to mining and processing activities. The Company has no prior history of completing the development of a mining project or conducting
mining operations. If found to be economically feasible, the future development of mineral resources will require the construction and
operation of a mine, processing plant and related infrastructure. While certain members of management have mining development and operational
experience, the Company does not have any such experience as a collective organization. As a result of these factors, the Company s
future success is more uncertain than if it had a proven operating history. 

27 

If
the Tonopah project advances, the Company is and will continue to be subject to all risks inherent with establishing new mining operations
including: the time and costs of construction of mining and processing facilities and related infrastructure; the availability and costs
of skilled labor and mining equipment and supplies; the need to obtain necessary environmental and other governmental approvals, licenses
and permits, and the timing of the receipt of those approvals, licenses and permits; the availability of funds to finance construction
and development activities; potential opposition from non-governmental organizations, indigenous peoples, environmental groups or local
groups which may delay or prevent development activities; and potential increases in construction and operating costs due to various
factors, including changes in the costs of fuel, power, labor, contractors, materials, supplies and equipment. 

It
is common in new mining operations to experience unexpected costs, problems and delays during construction, commissioning and mine start-up,
as well as delays in the early stages of mineral production. 

The
Company is concurrently overseeing the advancement of our major lithium projects. Work to advance these projects requires the dedication
of considerable time and resources by the Company and its management team. The advancement of the projects concurrently brings with it
the associated risk of strains on managerial, human and other resources. The Company s ability to successfully manage each of these
processes will depend on a number of factors, including its ability to manage competing demands on time and other resources, financial
or otherwise, and successfully retain personnel and recruit new personnel to support its growth and the advancement of its projects. 

Risks
Relating to the U.S. DOE Grant Programs 

The
DOE s invitation to enter into confirmatory due diligence and term sheet negotiations is not an assurance that DOE will offer a
term sheet to the applicant, or that the terms and conditions of any term sheet will be consistent with the terms proposed by the applicant.
The outcome of the Company s application to the DOE for funding is wholly dependent on the results of DOE advanced due diligence
and DOE s determination whether to proceed, and there can be no assurances as to the outcome of such due diligence review, whether
the DOE will determine to proceed and as to the terms and conditions of any term sheet that may be offered, if any. 

Permitting
Risks 

Our
operations in the United States are subject to the federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws applicable to the reclamation
of lithium-ion batteries and exploration for, and the development and operation of, mineral properties. Depending on how any particular
operation is structured, our operations and related facilities will have to obtain environmental permits or approvals to operate, including
those associated with, among other things, air emissions, water discharges, waste management and storage, and exploration and development
of mineral properties on federal lands and related processing facilities. We may face opposition from local residents or public interest
groups to the installation and operation of our facilities. Failure to secure (or significant delays in securing) the necessary approvals
could prevent us from pursuing some of our planned operations and adversely affect our business, financial results and growth prospects.
Additionally, there can be no certainty that current permits will be maintained, permitting changes will be approved, estimated permitting
timelines will be met, estimated costs will be accurate, or additional or approvals required to carry out recycling, extraction and refining
will be obtained. There is the risk that existing permits will be subject to challenges of regulatory administrative processes and similar
litigation and appeal processes. Litigation and regulatory review processes can result in lengthy delays, with uncertain outcomes. Such
issues could impact the expected timelines of the Company s projects and consequently have a material adverse effect on the Company s
prospects and business. 

Geopolitical
Risks 

In
recent years there has been a substantial increase in political tensions, which is particularly acute in respect to lithium. Lithium
has been identified as a critical mineral in multiple jurisdictions and is the subject of increasingly active industrial
policy. The Company does not believe this will result in a substantive adverse change to its business or operations. However, the Company
does expect that over time it may limit our ability to undertake business opportunities with actors from non-Western countries. 

28 

Cost
Estimate Risks 

Capital
costs, operating costs, raw materials costs, production and other estimates may differ significantly from those anticipated by the Company s
current estimates, and there can be no assurance that the Company s actual costs will not be higher than currently anticipated.
The Company s actual costs and production may vary from estimates for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to: lack
of or availability of raw materials, resources or necessary supplies or equipment; inflationary pressures flowing from global supply
chain shortages and increased transportation costs, which in turn are causing increased costs for supplies and equipment; increasing
labor and personnel costs; unexpected construction or operating problems; higher than expected cost of commodities or feedstock; lower
than expected realized lithium prices; revisions to construction plans; risks and hazards associated with exploration or mineral production;
natural phenomena; floods; unexpected labor shortages or strikes; and general inflationary pressures. Many of these factors are beyond
the Company s control and could have a material effect on the Company s operating cash flow, including the Company s
ability to service its indebtedness. 

Operating
Risks 

The
Company s operations are subject to all the hazards and risks normally incidental to the exploration for, and the development and
operation of, mineral properties. The Company strives to implement comprehensive health and safety measures designed to comply with government
regulations and protect the health and safety of the Company s workforce in all areas of its business. The Company also strives
to comply with environmental regulations in its operations. Nonetheless, risks associated with the Company s planned operations
include fires, power outages, shutdowns due to equipment breakdown or failure, aging of equipment or facilities, unexpected maintenance
and replacement expenditures, human error, labor disruptions or disputes, inclement weather, higher than forecast precipitation, flooding,
shortages of water, explosions, releases of hazardous materials, landslides, earthquakes, industrial accidents and explosions, protests
and other security issues, and the inability to obtain adequate machinery, equipment or labor due to shortages, strikes or public health
issues such as pandemics. 

Risk
of Hazardous Substances 

We
may be held responsible for the costs of remediating contamination at the site of current or former activities or at third party sites
or be held liable to third parties for exposure to hazardous substances should those be identified in the future. Under the U.S. Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 CERCLA and its state law equivalents, current or former
owners of properties may be held jointly and severally liable for the costs of site cleanup or required to undertake, remedial actions
in response to unpermitted releases of hazardous substances at such property, in addition to, among other potential consequences, liability
to governmental entities for the cost of damages to natural resources, which may be significant. 

Costs
and Requirements of Being a Public Company 

As
a public reporting company, we are subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
and other federal securities laws, rules and regulations. Complying with these laws and regulations requires more time and attention
of our Board of Directors and management and requires additional employees compared to a privately-held company. In addition, the costs
of preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC, furnishing audited reports
to stockholders, maintaining more comprehensive compliance functions, policies and procedures, and corporate governance, are greater
than that of a privately-held company. 

To
the extent any public or private offering of our securities is not conducted in accordance with applicable federal or state securities
laws, purchasers of our securities could be entitled to rescission rights. 

We
have issued a significant number of securities in public and private offerings and as payment for services or in connection with transactions.
It is possible, by reason of procedural or similar failures, or failures to provide disclosure or notices of sales, that a violation
of federal or state securities laws may have occurred. If a holder of our securities were successful in claiming that securities were
issued to such holder without such issuance being in compliance with applicable securities laws, we believe that the remedy to such holder
would be a rescission of the sale, pursuant to which the holder could be entitled to recover the amount paid for the security, plus interest
(usually at a statutory rate prescribed by state law). 

Risk
of Fraud, Misconduct, or Non-Compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws 

We
may be exposed to fraud, non-compliance with anti-corruption laws, or other misconduct committed by our employees, potential joint venture
partners, representatives, agents, vendors, customers or other third parties undertaking actions on our behalf that could subject us
to litigation, financial losses and fines or penalties imposed by governmental authorities and affect our reputation. 

29 

Such
misconduct could include, but is not limited to, misappropriating funds, engaging in misrepresentation or fraudulent, deceptive or otherwise
improper activities, including activities in exchange for personal benefit or gain or activities that otherwise do not comply with applicable
laws or our internal policies and procedures. The risk of fraud or other misconduct could increase as we expand our business. 

Risk
of Failure to Meet Development Timelines and Capital Estimates 

Our
required capital expenditures can be complex and challenging to predict, may experience delays or other difficulties, and the costs may
exceed our estimates. 

Our
capital expenditures primarily consist of substantial investments in new or used equipment, facilities and properties, as well as expenditures
to maintain and improve existing equipment, facilities and properties. Execution of these capital expenditures can be complex, and commencement
of production requires start-up, commission and certification of product quality by our customers, which may impact the expected output
and timing of sales of product from such facilities. Construction of large operations is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties,
including, among others, the ability to complete a project on a timely basis and in accordance with the estimated budget for such project
and our ability to estimate future demand for our products. In addition, our returns on these capital expenditures may not meet our expectations.
Future capital expenditures may be significantly higher, depending on the investment requirements of each of our business lines, and
may also vary substantially if we are required to undertake actions to compete with new technologies in our industry. We may not have
the capital necessary to undertake these capital investments. If we are unable to do so, we may not be able to effectively compete in
some of our markets. 

Risk
of Failure to Comply with Covenants 

The
Company has contractual arrangements that contain affirmative and negative covenants that must be adhered to. It is possible that the
Company could fail to meet the requirements of one or more covenants, resulting in penalties or acceleration of amounts due. No assurance
can be given that a breach will not occur. This could result in a default under our credit agreements that would permit the applicable
lenders to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If we are unable
to repay our debt, creditors would have the right to proceed against the collateral securing the debt. This in turn could have a material
adverse effect on the Company s business and operations. 

Going
Concern Risk 

The
continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon generating profit from its operations and its ability to obtain debt
or equity financing to meet expected cash requirements. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to generate sufficient profits,
obtain such financings, or obtain them on favorable terms, which could limit its operations. Any such financing activities are subject
to market conditions. 

These
uncertainties cause substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for 12 months from issuance of
these financial statements. In their report on our financial statements included in this Form 10-K, our independent auditors have expressed
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

Risks
from Changing Regulations and Laws 

Changes
to government laws and regulations may affect the development of the Company s projects. Such changes could include laws relating
to grant funds availability, taxation, royalties, restrictions on production, environmental, biodiversity and ecological compliance,
mine development and operations, mine safety, permitting and numerous other aspects of the business. 

Environmental
Risks and Regulations 

The
Company must comply with stringent environmental regulations. These are evolving in a manner that is expected to require stricter standards
and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects and
a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and employees. Applicable environmental laws and regulations
may require enhanced public disclosure and consultation. It is possible that a legal protest could be triggered through one of these
requirements or processes that could delay development activities. No assurance can be given that new environmental laws and regulations
will not be enacted or that existing environmental laws and regulations will not be applied in a manner that could limit or curtail the
Company s development programs. Such changes in environmental laws and regulations and associated regulatory requirements could
delay and/or increase project costs or increase the risk of environmental liability associated with project operations. This in turn
could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business and operations. 

30 

Insurance
Risks 

While
the Company maintains insurance to protect against certain risks associated with its business, insurance may not be available to insure
against all risks, or the costs of such insurance may be uneconomic. The Company may also elect not to obtain insurance for other reasons.
Insurance policies maintained by the Company may not be adequate to cover the full costs of actual liabilities incurred by the Company
or may not be continued by insurers for reasons not solely within the Company s control. The Company maintains liability insurance
in accordance with industry standards. However, losses from uninsured and underinsured liabilities have the potential to materially affect
the Company s financial position and prospects. 

Health
and Safety Risks 

The
Company carries a risk of liability related to workers health and safety. Compliance with health and safety laws, and any changes
to such laws, and the requirements of applicable permits and other regulatory requirements remains material to the Company s business.
The Company may become subject to government orders, investigations, inquiries or other proceedings (including civil claims) relating
to health and safety matters. The occurrence of any of these events or any changes, additions to or more rigorous enforcement of health
and safety laws, permits or other approvals could have a significant impact on operations and result in additional costs or penalties.
In turn, these could have a material adverse effect on the Company s reputation, operations and future prospects. 

Risk
of Catastrophic Events, Terrorism and War 

The
occurrence or threat of extraordinary events, including domestic and international terrorist attacks, may disrupt our operations and
decrease demand for our products. Certain assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the
United States and around the world. Extraordinary events cannot be predicted, and their occurrence may negatively affect the economy
in general, and the markets for our products in particular. The resulting damage from a direct attack on our assets, or assets used by
us, could include loss of life and property damage. In addition, available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all the
damage incurred or, if available, may be prohibitively expensive. 

Risk
of Accounting Estimates and Impairment Charges 

We
make certain accounting estimates and projections in connection with our impairment analysis for long-lived assets in accordance with
applicable accounting guidance. An impairment charge may be required if the impairment analysis indicates that the carrying value of
an asset exceeds the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows of the asset. The projection of future cash flows used in this analysis
requires the use of judgment and a number of estimates and projections of future operating results. If actual results differ from Company
estimates, additional charges for asset impairments may be required in the future. If impairment charges are significant, our financial
results could be negatively affected. 

Mineral
Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimation Risks 

Mineral
Resources and Mineral Reserves figures are estimates only. Estimated tonnages and grades may not be achieved if the projects are brought
into production; differences in grades and tonnage could be material; and, estimated levels of recovery may not be realized. The estimation
of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves carries with it many inherent uncertainties, of which many are outside the control of the Company.
Estimation is by its very nature a subjective process, which is based on the quality and quantity of available data, engineering assumptions,
geological interpretation and judgements used in the engineering and estimation processes. Estimates may also need to be revised based
on changes to underlying assumptions, such as commodity prices, drilling results, metallurgical testing, production, and changes to mine
plans of operation. Any material decreases in estimates of Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves, or an inability to extract Mineral
Reserves could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its business, results of operations and financial position. 

31 

Any
estimates of Inferred Mineral Resources are also subject to a high degree of uncertainty and may require a significant amount of exploration
work to determine if they can be upgraded to a higher confidence category. Risks associated with upgrading the Tonopah project to a higher
confidence category include the accuracy of fault modeling and offset of lithium-hosting lithologies on western-side of mineral resource,
the lack of project-specific lithologic density data, the accuracy of processing cost used in the pit optimization to define the resource
which can potentially affect resource cut-off grades, and the large fluctuations in commodity prices which can potentially affect resource
cut-off grades. 

Exploration
Stage Company Risks 

We
cannot assure you about the existence of economically extractable mineralization at this time, nor about the quantity or grade of any
mineralization we may have found. Because the probability of an individual prospect ever having reserves is uncertain, our properties
may not contain any reserves and any funds spent on evaluation and exploration may be lost. Even if we confirm reserves on our properties,
any quantity or grade of reserves we indicate must be considered as estimates only until such reserves are mined. We do not know with
certainty that economically recoverable minerals exist on our properties. In addition, the quantity of any reserves may vary depending
on commodity prices. Any material change in the quantity or grade of reserves may affect the economic viability of our properties. Further,
our lack of established reserves means that we are uncertain about our ability to generate revenue from our operations. 

Even
if we do eventually discover a mineral reserve on one or more of our properties, there can be no assurance that they can be developed
into producing mines and that we can extract those minerals. Both mineral exploration and development involve a high degree of risk,
and few mineral properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. 

Water
Management Risks 

Water
management regulations are in place in Nevada where the Company s projects are located. As such, the Company must obtain sufficient
water rights and transfer those rights such that they may be used for planned recycling and extraction projects. The Company s
flowsheets are designed and/or being designed to lower the use of water to the extent possible by incorporating recycling technologies.
The availability of water and pricing of water rights are risks that may be heightened by the potential effects of climate change and
could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business. 

Climate
Change Risks 

The
introduction of climate change legislation is an increasing focus of various levels of government worldwide. The Company is committed
to developing its business with a view to contributing to the low carbon economy. This includes incorporating sustainable energy sources
and minimizing the use of non-renewable sources of energy to the extent that renewable sources are available with sufficient capacity,
at cost effective pricing and that are complementary to the facilities and site design. However, the use of such low carbon technologies
may be more costly in certain instances than non-renewable options in the near-term, or may result in higher design costs, long-term
maintenance costs or replacement costs. Additionally, if the trend toward increasing regulations continues, the Company may face increasing
operating costs at its projects to comply with these changing regulations. Until then, the Company views the risk of occurrence of such
litigation as being low. 

Risk
of Future Losses and Lack of Profitability 

The
Company anticipates it will continue to have negative cash flow from operating activities in future periods until profitable commercial
production is achieved. Although the Company has cash on hand and access to additional cash, the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern will be dependent upon its ability to generate profits from its proposed operations, or to raise capital through equity
or debt financing to continue to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come
due. 

32 

Intellectual
Property Risks 

The
Company relies on the ability to protect its intellectual property rights and depends on patent, trademark and trade secret legislation
to protect its proprietary know-how. There is no assurance that the Company has adequately protected or will be able to adequately protect
its valuable intellectual property rights or will at all times have access to all intellectual property rights that are required to conduct
its business or pursue its strategies, or that the Company will be able to adequately protect itself against any intellectual property
infringement claims. There is also a risk that the Company s competitors could independently develop similar technology, processes
or know-how; that the Company s trade secrets could be revealed to third parties; that any current or future patents, pending or
granted, will be broad enough to protect the Company s intellectual property rights; or, that foreign intellectual property laws
will adequately protect such rights. The inability to protect the Company s intellectual property could have a material adverse
effect on the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, the applied science industry is
characterized by frequent allegations of intellectual property infringement. Though we do not expect to be subject to any of these allegations,
any allegation of infringement could be time consuming and expensive to defend or resolve, result in substantial diversion of management
resources, cause suspension of operations or force us to enter into royalty, license, or other agreement, rather than dispute the merits
of such allegation. If patent holders or other holders of intellectual property initiate legal proceedings, we may be forced into protracted
and costly litigation. We may not be successful in defending such litigation and may not be able to procure any required royalty or license
agreements on acceptable terms or at all. 

Risk
of Defects in Title 

We
have investigated our rights to the assets we have purchased and developed, and, to the best of our knowledge, those rights are in good
standing. However, no assurance can be given that such rights will not be revoked, or significantly altered, to our detriment. There
can also be no assurance that our rights will not be challenged or impugned by third parties, including by governments and non-governmental
organizations. 

Risks
Related to Research, and Development, and Changing Technology 

Our
research and development efforts may not succeed in addressing changes in our customers needs, and our competitors may develop
more effective or successful products. The development and adoption of new battery technologies could rely on inputs other than lithium
compounds which could significantly impact our prospects and future revenues. 

Current
and next generation high energy density batteries for use in electric vehicles rely on lithium compounds as a critical input. The pace
of advances in current battery technologies, the development and adoption of new battery technologies that rely on inputs other than
lithium compounds, or a delay in the development and adoption of next generation high nickel battery technologies that utilize lithium
hydroxide could significantly impact our prospects and future revenues. Many materials and technologies are being researched and developed
with the goal of making batteries lighter, more efficient, faster charging and less expensive. Some of these could be less reliant on
lithium hydroxide or other lithium compounds, especially if the demand for batteries for use in electric vehicles outstrips the available
supply of lithium hydroxide or other lithium compounds. We cannot predict which new technologies may ultimately prove to be commercially
viable and their share in the overall mix over any time horizon. Commercialized battery technologies that use less lithium compounds
could materially and adversely impact our prospects and future revenues. 

Joint
Venture, Acquisition and Strategic Alliance Risks 

Our
business strategy includes, in part, entering into potential joint ventures, acquisitions, and strategic alliances with parties involved
in the manufacture and recycling of lithium-ion products. Failure to successfully identify or integrate such potential joint ventures,
acquisitions or strategic alliances into our operations could adversely affect our business. Joint ventures, acquisitions and strategic
alliances may involve significant other risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management s attention away from normal
business operations, insufficient revenue generation to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the transaction, and
unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence process, such as product quality, technology issues and legal contingencies.
In addition, we may be unable to effectively integrate any such initiatives into our operations. Our operating results could be adversely
affected by any problems arising during or from such activity. 

33 

Risks
of Relying on Consultants 

The
Company has relied on, and may continue to rely on, consultants and others for mineral exploration and exploitation expertise. The Company
believes that those consultants are competent and that they have carried out their work in accordance with internationally recognized
industry standards. However, if the work conducted by those consultants is ultimately found to be incorrect or inadequate in any material
respect, the Company may experience delays or increased costs in developing its properties. 

Risk
of No Dividends 

The
Company has not paid dividends on its Common Shares since incorporation, and currently has no ability to generate earnings as it is pre-revenue.
The Company anticipates that it will retain its earnings and other cash resources for future operations and the ongoing development of
its business. As such, the Company does not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Payment of any future
dividends is solely at the discretion of the Board, which will take into account many factors including the Company s operating
results, financial condition and anticipated cash needs. 

Information
Technology and Cybersecurity Risks 

Threats
to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow and evolve in terms
of severity and sophistication, particularly with the increase in remote work that began during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cybersecurity
attack has the potential to compromise the business, financial and other systems of the Company, and could go unnoticed for some time.
Risks associated with cybersecurity threats include, among other things, loss of intellectual property, disruption of business operations
and safety procedures, loss or damage to worksite data delivery systems, privacy and confidentiality breaches, and increased costs and
time to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity incidents. The Company has implemented a cybersecurity policy and provided training
to its personnel as mitigation measures. System and network maintenance, upgrades and similar best practices are also followed. However,
despite these measures, the occurrence of a significant cybersecurity incident could have a material adverse effect on the Company s
business and result in a prolonged disruption to it. 

Talent
Risk 

The
Company highly values the contributions of its key personnel. The success of the Company continues to depend largely upon the performance
of key officers, employees and consultants who have advanced the Company to its current stage of development and contributed to its potential
for future growth. The market for qualified talent has become increasingly competitive, with shortages of qualified talent relative to
the number of available opportunities being experienced in all markets where the Company conducts its operations. The ability to remain
competitive by offering higher compensation packages and programs for growth and development of personnel, with a view to retaining existing
talent and attracting new talent, has become increasingly important to the Company and its operations in the current climate. Any prolonged
inability to retain key individuals, or to attract and retain new talent as the Company grows, could have a material adverse effect upon
the Company s growth potential and prospects. 

Additionally,
the Company has not purchased any key-man insurance for any of its directors, officers or key employees and currently has
no plans to do so. 

Implementation
of Business Plan Risks 

Our
ability to successfully implement our business plan requires an effective planning and management process. If funding is available, we
may elect to increase the scope of our operations and acquire complementary businesses. Implementing our business plan will require significant
additional funding and resources. If we grow our operations, we will need to hire additional employees and make significant capital investments.
If we grow our operations, it will place a significant strain on our existing management and resources. Additionally, we will need to
improve our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures, and we will need to expand, train and manage our
workforce. Any failure to manage any of the foregoing areas efficiently and effectively would cause our business to suffer. 

34 

Risk
of Failure of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
reporting obligations as a public company place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources and systems.
Because we failed to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we could experience delays or inaccuracies
in our reporting of financial information, or non-compliance with the SEC, reporting and other regulatory requirements. This could subject
us to regulatory scrutiny and result in a loss of public confidence in our management, which could, among other things, cause our stock
price to drop. 

Risks
of Legal Proceedings 

The
Company may be subject to a variety of regulatory requirements, and resulting investigations, claims, lawsuits and other proceedings
in the ordinary course of its business, as a result of its status as a publicly traded company and because of its mining exploration
and development business. Litigation related to environmental and climate change-related matters, ESG disclosure, and securities class
actions arising from share price volatility is also on the rise. The occurrence and outcome of any legal proceedings cannot be predicted
with any reasonable degree of certainty due to the inherently uncertain nature of litigation, including the effects of discovery of new
evidence or advancement of new legal theories, the difficulty of predicting decisions of judges and juries and the possibility that decisions
may be reversed on appeal. Defense and settlement costs of legal claims can be substantial, even with respect to claims that are determined
to have little or no merit. 

Litigation
may be costly and time-consuming and can divert the attention of management and key personnel away from day-to-day business operations.
The Company and its projects are, from time to time, subject to legal proceedings or the threat of legal proceedings. If the Company
were to be unsuccessful in defending any such claims against it, or unable to settle claims on a satisfactory basis, the Company may
be faced with significant monetary damages, injunctive relief or other negative impacts that could have a material adverse effect on
the Company s business and financial condition. To the extent the Company is involved in any active litigation, the outcome of
such matters may not be determinable, and it may not be possible to accurately predict the outcome or quantum of any such proceedings
at a given time. 

Changes
to Tax Laws and Other Tax Risks 

Changes
to U.S. tax laws could adversely affect the Company or holders of the Common Shares. In recent years, many changes to U.S. federal income
tax laws have been proposed and made, and additional changes to U.S. federal income tax laws are likely to continue to occur in the future. 

We
are subject to review and audit by U.S. federal, state, local tax authorities. Tax authorities may disagree with or challenge tax positions
we take, which if successful could harm our business. We may be subject to additional tax liabilities due to changes in non-income based
taxes resulting from changes in federal, state or local tax laws, changes in taxing jurisdictions administrative interpretations,
decisions, policies, and positions, results of tax examinations, settlements, or judicial decisions, changes in accounting principles,
changes to our business operations, including acquisitions, as well as the evaluation of new information that results in a change to
a tax position taken in a prior period. In the future, the company may also be subject to foreign jurisdictions where tax law changes
may pose a similar risk.
