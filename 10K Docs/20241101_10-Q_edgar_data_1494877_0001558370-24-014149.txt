 EXPLANATORY NOTE This report combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 of Digital Realty Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and Digital Realty Trust, L.P., a Maryland limited partnership, of which Digital Realty Trust, Inc. is the sole general partner. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this report to we, us, our, our Company , or the Company refer to Digital Realty Trust, Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including Digital Realty Trust, L.P. In statements regarding qualification as a REIT, such terms refer solely to Digital Realty Trust, Inc. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references to the Parent refer to Digital Realty Trust, Inc., and all references to our Operating Partnership, the Operating Partnership or the OP refer to Digital Realty Trust, L.P. together with its consolidated subsidiaries. The Parent is a real estate investment trust, or REIT, and the sole general partner of the OP. As of September 30, 2024, the Parent owned an approximate 98.1 common general partnership interest in Digital Realty Trust, L.P. The remaining approximate 1.9 of the common limited partnership interests of Digital Realty Trust, L.P. are owned by non-affiliated third parties and certain directors and officers of the Parent. As of September 30, 2024, the Parent owned all of the preferred limited partnership interests of Digital Realty Trust, L.P. As the sole general partner of Digital Realty Trust, L.P., the Parent has the full, exclusive and complete responsibility for the OP s day-to-day management and control. We believe combining the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of the Parent and the OP into this single report results in the following benefits: enhancing investors understanding of the Parent and the OP by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business; eliminating duplicative disclosure and providing a more streamlined and readable presentation since a substantial portion of the disclosure applies to both the Parent and the OP; and creating time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports. 
 It is important to understand the few differences between the Parent and the OP in the context of how we operate the Company. The Parent does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general partner of the OP and issuing public equity from time to time and guaranteeing certain unsecured debt of the OP and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates. The OP holds substantially all the assets of the business, directly or indirectly. The OP conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for net proceeds from equity issuances by the Parent, which are generally contributed to the OP in exchange for partnership units, the OP generates the capital required by the business through the OP s operations, incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of partnership units to third parties. The presentation of noncontrolling interests, stockholders equity and partners capital are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of the Parent and those of the OP. The differences in the presentations between stockholders equity and partners capital result from the differences in the equity and capital issuances in the Parent and in the OP. To highlight the differences between the Parent and the OP, separate sections in this report, as applicable, individually discuss the Parent and the OP, including separate financial statements and separate Exhibit 31 and 32 certifications. In the sections that combine disclosure of the Parent and the OP, this report refers to actions or holdings as being actions or holdings of the Company. As general partner with control of the OP, the Parent consolidates the OP for financial reporting purposes, and it does not have significant assets other than its investment in the OP. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of the Parent and the OP are the same on their respective condensed consolidated financial statements. The separate discussions of the Parent and the OP in this report should be read in conjunction with each other to understand the results of the Company on a consolidated basis and how management operates the Company.

We are cooperating with the SEC and are not aware of any cybersecurity issue or event that caused the Staff to open this matter. Responding to an investigation of this type can be costly and time-consuming. While we are unable to predict the likely outcome of this matter or the potential cost or exposure or duration of the process, based on the information we currently possess, we do not expect the total potential cost to be material to our financial condition. If the SEC believes that violations occurred, it could seek remedies including, but not limited to, civil monetary penalties and injunctive relief, and/or file litigation against the Company.

Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to identify all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Occupancy percentages included in the following discussion, for some of our properties, are calculated based on factors in addition to contractually leased square feet, including available power, required support space and common area. As used in this report: Ascenty entity refers to the entity which owns and operates Ascenty, formed with Brookfield Infrastructure. Business Overview and Strategy Digital Realty Trust, Inc., through its controlling interest in Digital Realty Trust, L.P. and its subsidiaries, delivers comprehensive space, power, and interconnection solutions that enable its customers and partners to connect with each other and service their own customers on a global technology and real estate platform. We are a leading global provider of data center, colocation and interconnection solutions for customers across a variety of industry verticals. Digital Realty Trust, Inc. operates as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, and our Operating Partnership is the entity through which we conduct our business and own our assets. Our primary business objectives are to maximize: (i) sustainable long-term growth in earnings and funds from operations per share and unit; (ii) cash flow and returns to our stockholders and Digital Realty Trust, L.P. s unitholders through the payment of distributions; and (iii) return on invested capital. We expect to accomplish our objectives by achieving superior risk-adjusted returns, prudently allocating capital, diversifying our product offerings, accelerating our global reach and scale, and driving revenue growth and operating efficiencies. A significant component of our current and future internal growth is anticipated through the development of our existing space held for development, acquisition of land for future development, and acquisition of new properties.

 We target high-quality, strategically located properties containing the physical and connectivity infrastructure that supports the applications and operations of data center and technology industry customers and properties that may be developed for such use. Most of our data center properties contain fully redundant electrical supply systems, multiple power feeds, above-standard cooling systems, raised floor areas, extensive in-building communications cabling and high-level security systems. Fundamentally, we bring together foundational real estate and innovative technology expertise around the world to deliver a comprehensive, dedicated product suite to meet customers data and connectivity needs. We represent an important part of the digital economy that we believe will benefit from powerful, long-term growth drivers. We have developed detailed, standardized procedures for evaluating new real estate investments to ensure that they meet our financial, technical and other criteria. We expect to continue to acquire additional assets as part of our growth strategy. We intend to aggressively manage and lease our assets to increase their cash flow. We may continue to build out our development portfolio when justified by anticipated demand and returns. We may acquire properties subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness or we may incur new indebtedness in connection with acquiring or refinancing these properties. Debt service on such indebtedness will have a priority over any cash dividends with respect to Digital Realty Trust, Inc. s common stock and preferred stock. We are committed to maintaining a conservative capital structure. Our goal is to average through business cycles the following financial ratios: 1) a debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA ratio around 5.5x, 2) a fixed charge coverage of greater than three times, and 3) floating rate debt at less than 20 of total outstanding debt. In addition, we strive to maintain a well-laddered debt maturity schedule, and we seek to maximize the menu of our available sources of capital, while minimizing the cost. Changes in political conditions, geopolitical turmoil, political instability, civil disturbances, restrictive governmental actions or nationalization in the countries in which we operate, including escalations in political and trade tensions involving the U.S. and regulatory and legislative changes, could potentially result in adverse effects on our, and our customers , operations. Summary of 2024 Significant Activities We completed the following significant activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024: In January 2024, we: o formed a joint venture with Blackstone Inc. to develop four hyperscale data center campuses across Frankfurt, Paris and Northern Virginia. We received approximately 231 million of net proceeds from the contribution of our data centers to the first phase of the joint venture and retained a 20 interest in the joint venture. o closed on the sale of our interest in four data centers to Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P., or Brookfield, for approximately 271 million. The sale was completed subsequent to Brookfield s November 2023 acquisition of one of our customers, Cyxtera Technologies. As a result of the sale, we recognized a total gain on disposition of approximately 203.1 million, of which 194.2 million is included within Gain on disposition of properties, net and 8.9 million is included within Equity in (loss) earnings of unconsolidated entities on our condensed consolidated income statements. 
 In March 2024, we formed a joint venture with Mitsubishi Corporation, or Mitsubishi, to support the development of two data centers in the Dallas metro area. The facilities were 100 pre-leased prior to construction. We contributed the two data center buildings at a contribution value of approximately 261 million. We received approximately 153 million of gross proceeds from the contribution of our data centers to the joint venture and retained a 35 interest in the joint venture. Mitsubishi contributed such cash in exchange for a 65 interest in the joint venture.

 In April 2024, we: o expanded our existing joint venture with GI Partners with the sale to GI Partners of a 75 interest in a third facility on the same hyperscale data center campus in Chicago. We contributed the data center at a value of approximately 453 million. We received approximately 386 million of net proceeds from the contribution of our data center to the joint venture and the associated financing and retained a 25 interest in the joint venture. As a result of transferring control, we derecognized the data center and recognized a gain on disposition of approximately 172 million. o completed the sale of an additional 24.9 interest in a data center facility in Frankfurt, Germany to DCREIT for total consideration of approximately 126 million, and DCREIT now has a 49.9 interest in the Frankfurt data center. Because the Company still controls this asset, no gain or loss was recorded on this 49.9 interest. In connection with this transaction, DCREIT loaned the consolidated subsidiary that owns the data center approximately 80 million. As of September 30, 2024, DCREIT has loaned 160.4 million, which is secured by the Frankfurt data center and is recorded in our condensed consolidated balance sheets within Accounts payable and other accrued liabilities. 
 In May 2024, Digital Realty Trust, Inc. and Digital Realty Trust, L.P. entered into an underwriting agreement with BofA Securities, Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters relating to the sale of up to approximately 12.1 million shares of common stock (including approximately 1.6 million shares that the underwriters had the option to purchase, and which option was exercised in full on May 8, 2024), at a purchase price to the underwriters of 136.66 per share. The offering closed on May 10, 2024, and we received net proceeds of approximately 1.7 billion. In September 2024: o Digital Dutch Finco B.V., an indirect wholly owned finance subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, issued and sold 850 million aggregate principal amount of 3.875 Guaranteed Notes due 2033 (the 2033 Notes ). Net proceeds from the offering were approximately 843 million (approximately 933 million based on the exchange rate on September 13, 2024) after deducting managers discounts and estimated offering expenses. o we refinanced our Global Revolving Credit Facility and Yen Revolving Credit Facility. The Global Revolving Credit Facilities provide for borrowings up to 4.5 billion (including approximately 0.3 billion available to be drawn on the Yen Revolving Credit Facility) based on currency commitments and foreign exchange rates as of September 30, 2024. The Global Revolving Credit Facility provides for borrowings in a variety of currencies and can be increased by an additional 1.8 billion, subject to receipt of lender commitments and other conditions precedent. Both facilities mature on January 24, 2029, with two six-month extension options available.

 Revenue Base Most of our revenue consists of rental income generated by the data centers in our portfolio. Our ability to generate and grow revenue depends on several factors, including our ability to maintain or improve occupancy rates. A summary of our data center portfolio and related occupied square feet (in thousands) (excluding space under development or held for development) is shown below. Unconsolidated portfolios shown below consist of assets owned by unconsolidated entities in which we have invested. We often provide management services for these entities under management agreements and receive management fees. These are shown as Managed Unconsolidated Portfolio. Entities for which we do not provide such services are shown as Non-Managed Unconsolidated Portfolio.

 Leasing Activities Due to the capital-intensive and long-term nature of the operations we support, our lease terms with customers are generally longer than standard commercial leases. As of September 30, 2024, our average remaining lease term was approximately five years. Our ability to re-lease expiring space at rental rates equal to or in excess of current rental rates will impact our results of operations. The subsequent table summarizes our leasing activity in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (square feet in thousands):

 (1) For some of our properties, we calculate square footage based on factors in addition to contractually leased square feet, including power, required support space and common area. (2) Rental rates represent average annual estimated base cash rent per rentable square foot calculated for each contract based on total cash base rent divided by the total number of years in the contract (including any tenant concessions). All rates were calculated in the local currency of each contract and then converted to USD based on average exchange rates for the period presented. (3) Excludes short-term leases. (4) Commencement dates for the leases signed range from 2024 to 2025. (5) Includes leases signed for new and re-leased space. (6) Other includes Powered Base Building shell capacity as well as storage and office space within fully improved data center facilities. We continue to see strong demand in most of our key metropolitan areas for data center space and, subject to the supply of available data center space in these metropolitan areas, we expect average aggregate rental rates on renewed data center leases for 2024 expirations to be positive as compared with the rates currently being paid for the same space on a GAAP basis and on a cash basis. Our past performance may not be indicative of future results, and we cannot assure you that leases will be renewed or that our data centers will be re-leased at all or at rental rates equal to or above the current average rental rates. Further, re-leased/renewed rental rates in a particular metropolitan area may not be consistent with rental rates across our portfolio as a whole and may fluctuate from one period to another due to a number of factors, including local economic conditions, local supply and demand for data center space, competition from other data center developers or operators, the condition of the property and whether the property, or space within the property, has been developed.

 Geographic Concentration We depend on the market for data centers in specific geographic regions and significant changes in these regional or metropolitan areas can impact our future results. The following table shows the geographic concentration based on annualized rent from our portfolio, including data centers held as investments in unconsolidated entities.

Includes consolidated portfolio and unconsolidated entities at the entities 100 ownership level. The aggregate amount of abatements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 31.1 million. 
 Operating Expenses Operating expenses primarily consist of utilities, property and ad valorem taxes, property management fees, insurance and site maintenance costs, and rental expenses on our ground and building leases. Our buildings require significant power to support data center operations and the cost of electric power and other utilities is a significant component of operating expenses. Many of our leases contain provisions under which tenants reimburse us for all or a portion of property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred by us. However, in some cases we are not entitled to reimbursement of property operating expenses, other than utility expense, and real estate taxes under our leases for Turn-Key Flex facilities. We expect to incur additional operating expenses as we continue to expand. Costs pertaining to our asset management function, legal, accounting, corporate governance, reporting and compliance are categorized as general and administrative costs within operating expenses. Other key components of operating expenses include depreciation of our fixed assets, amortization of intangible assets, and transaction and integration costs.

 Other Income / (Expenses) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities, gain on disposition of properties, interest expense, and income tax expense make up the majority of Other income/(expenses). Equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities represents our share of the income/(loss) of entities in which we invest, but do not consolidate under U.S. GAAP. The largest of these investments is currently our investment in Ascenty, which is located primarily in Latin America. Our second-largest equity-method investment is Digital Core REIT, which is publicly traded on the Singapore Exchange SGX ), and which owns a portfolio of 10 properties operating in the United States, Canada, Germany and Japan. Refer to additional discussion of Digital Core REIT and Ascenty in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of Operations As a result of the consistent and significant growth in our business since the first property acquisition in 2002, we evaluate period-to-period results for revenue and property level operating expenses on a stabilized versus non-stabilized portfolio basis. Stabilized : The stabilized portfolio includes properties owned as of the beginning of all periods presented with less than 5 of total rentable square feet under development. Non-stabilized : The non-stabilized portfolio includes: (1) properties that were undergoing, or were expected to undergo, development activities during any of the periods presented; (2) any properties contributed to joint ventures, sold, or held for sale during the periods presented; and (3) any properties that were acquired or delivered at any point during the periods presented.

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change Stabilized 1,085,360 1,121,187 (35,827) (3.2) 3,212,416 3,271,776 (59,360) (1.8) Non-Stabilized 328,367 273,426 54,941 20.1 857,550 803,232 54,318 6.8 Rental and other services 1,413,727 1,394,613 19,114 1.4 4,069,966 4,075,008 (5,042) (0.1) Fee income and other 17,487 7,819 9,668 123.6 49,140 32,414 16,726 51.6 Total operating revenues 1,431,214 1,402,432 28,782 2.1 4,119,106 4,107,422 11,684 0.3 Total operating revenues increased by approximately 28.8 million and 11.7 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. Stabilized rental and other services revenue decreased 35.8 million and 59.4 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to: (i) a decrease of 50.2 million and 145.6 million, respectively, in utility reimbursement largely driven by power price decreases, mainly in EMEA and APAC; (ii) a decrease of 5.2 million and an increase of 7.6 million, respectively, in other tenant reimbursements due to adjustments on property tax reimbursements based on new property tax assessments within the Chicago metro area, offset by a favorable property tax assessment at one of our North American properties realized in early 2023, which was passed through to our customers; and (iii) offset by an increase of 19.6 million and 78.6 million, respectively, in new leasing and renewals across all regions. 
 Non-stabilized rental and other services revenue increased 54.9 million and 54.3 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to: (i) an increase of 113.7 million and 296.4 million, respectively, due to the completion of our global development pipeline and related lease up operating activities (with the biggest contributions in Northern Virginia, Portland, New York, Johannesburg, Toronto, Zurich, Paris and Cape Town); and (ii) offset by a decrease of 58.8 million and 242.1 million, respectively, related to properties sold or contributed after September 30, 2023.

Total Utilities Total stabilized utilities expenses decreased by approximately 58.1 million and 148.4 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to lower power pricing at certain properties in the stabilized portfolio, mainly in EMEA and APAC. Total non-stabilized utilities expenses increased by approximately 29.7 million and increased by approximately 38.5 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to: (i) an increase of approximately 53.1 million and 117.4 million, respectively, due to higher utility consumption in a growing portfolio of recently completed development sites (with the biggest contributions in Northern Virginia, Portland, Zurich, Cape Town and Johannesburg); (ii) a decrease in power agreement credits by 14.2 million and 26.0 million, respectively; and (iii) offset by a decrease of 9.2 million and 52.9 million, respectively, related to properties sold or contributed after September 30, 2023. The cost of electric power comprises a significant component of our operating expenses. Any additional taxation or regulation of energy use, including as a result of (i) new legislation that the U.S. Congress may pass, (ii) the regulations that the U.S. EPA has proposed or finalized, (iii) regulations under legislation that states have passed or may pass, or (iv) any further legislation or regulations in EMEA, APAC or other regions where we operate could significantly increase our costs, and we may not be able to effectively pass all of these costs on to our customers. These matters could adversely impact our business, results of operations, or financial condition.

 Total Rental Property Operating and Maintenance (Excluding Utilities) Total stabilized rental property operating and maintenance expenses (excluding utilities) increased by approximately 16.1 million and 34.8 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to an increase in common area maintenance expense and data center labor. Total non-stabilized rental property operating and maintenance expenses (excluding utilities) increased by approximately 10.6 million and 4.4 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to an increase in data center labor expense throughout the portfolio. Total Property Taxes and Insurance Total stabilized property taxes and insurance decreased by approximately 3.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, based on new property tax assessments within the Chicago metro area. Total stabilized property taxes and insurance increased by approximately 13.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to a favorable property tax assessment at one of our North American properties realized in early 2023. Total non-stabilized property taxes and insurance decreased 22.6 million and 37.6 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily related to properties sold or contributed after September 30, 2023. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses include costs which are either non-cash in nature (such as depreciation and amortization) or which do not directly pertain to operation of data center properties. A comparison of other operating expenses for the respective periods is shown below (in thousands).

The foreign exchange remeasurement of debt associated with our unconsolidated Ascenty entity creates volatility in our equity in earnings and drove this fluctuation. Gain on Disposition of Properties, Net Gain on disposition of properties decreased approximately 811.2 million and 449.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023. In January 2024, we closed on the sale of our interest in four data centers to Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P., or Brookfield, for approximately 271 million. As a result of the sale, we recognized a total gain on disposition of approximately 194.2 million.

 In March 2024, we recognized a total gain of 74.4 million from the sale of an easement to a local power provider in Northern Virginia. In April 2024, we expanded our existing joint venture with GI Partners with the sale to GI Partners of a 75 interest in a third facility on the same hyperscale data center campus in Chicago. We contributed the data center at a value of approximately 453 million. We received approximately 386 million of net proceeds from the contribution of our data center to the joint venture and the associated financing and retained a 25 interest in the joint venture. As a result of transferring control, we derecognized the data center and recognized a gain on disposition of approximately 172 million. In July 2023, we received approximately 0.7 billion of gross proceeds from the contribution of our data centers to the joint venture with GI Partners for a net gain on sale of approximately 238 million and we received approximately 1.4 billion of gross proceeds from the contribution of our data centers to the joint venture with TPG Real Estate for a net gain on sale of approximately 576 million. In May 2023, we disposed of a non-core asset, resulting in a net gain on sale of 90 million. Loss on Debt Extinguishment and Modifications Loss on debt extinguishment and modifications increased approximately 2.6 million and 3.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023. In January 2024, we paid down 240 million on the U.S. term loan facility, leaving 500 million outstanding. The paydown resulted in an early extinguishment charge of approximately 1.1 million. In September 2024, we paid down 375 million on the Euro Term Loan Facilities, leaving 375 million outstanding. The paydown resulted in an early extinguishment charge of approximately 1.6 million. We also refinanced our Global Revolving Credit Facilities and wrote off deferred loan costs of approximately 1.2 million. Interest Expense Interest expense increased approximately 13.0 million and 24.0 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023 driven primarily by increased borrowings at Teraco. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense decreased by approximately 4.8 million and 5.0 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023 due to jurisdictional rate mix in foreign jurisdictions. We carried out an analysis for the purposes of the Model GloBE Rules for Pillar Two and no material top-up tax is expected. Liquidity and Capital Resources The sections Analysis of Liquidity and Capital Resources Parent and Analysis of Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Partnership should be read in conjunction with one another to understand our liquidity and capital resources on a consolidated basis. The term Parent refers to Digital Realty Trust, Inc. on an unconsolidated basis, excluding our Operating Partnership. The term Operating Partnership or OP refers to Digital Realty Trust, L.P. on a consolidated basis.

 Analysis of Liquidity and Capital Resources Parent Our Parent does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, issuing public equity from time to time, incurring certain expenses in operating as a public company (which are fully reimbursed by the Operating Partnership) and guaranteeing certain unsecured debt of the Operating Partnership and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates. If our Operating Partnership or such subsidiaries fail to fulfill their debt requirements, which trigger Parent guarantee obligations, then our Parent will be required to fulfill its cash payment commitments under such guarantees. Our Parent s only material asset is its investment in our Operating Partnership. Our Parent s principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common and preferred stock. Our Parent s principal source of funding is the distributions it receives from our Operating Partnership. As the sole general partner of our Operating Partnership, our Parent has the full, exclusive and complete responsibility for our Operating Partnership s day-to-day management and control. Our Parent causes our Operating Partnership to distribute such portion of its available cash as our Parent may in its discretion determine, in the manner provided in our Operating Partnership s partnership agreement. As circumstances warrant, our Parent may issue equity from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing. Any proceeds from such equity issuances would generally be contributed to our Operating Partnership in exchange for additional equity interests in our Operating Partnership. Our Operating Partnership may use the proceeds to acquire additional properties, to fund development opportunities and for general working capital purposes, including potentially for the repurchase, redemption or retirement of outstanding debt or equity securities. Our Parent and our Operating Partnership were parties to an ATM Equity Offering SM Sales Agreement dated August 4, 2023 (the 2023 Sales Agreement ). Pursuant to the 2023 Sales Agreement, Digital Realty Trust, Inc. could issue and sell common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 1.5 billion through various named agents from time to time. From January 1, 2024 through February 23, 2024, Digital Realty Trust, Inc. generated net proceeds of approximately 99 million from the issuance of approximately 0.6 million common shares under the 2023 Sales Agreement at an average price of 133.43 per share after payment of approximately 0.6 million of commissions to the agents. The 2023 Sales Agreement was amended on February 23, 2024 (the 2024 Sales Agreement Amendment ). At the time of the amendment, 258.3 million remained unsold under the 2023 Sales Agreement. Pursuant to the 2024 Sales Agreement Amendment, Digital Realty Trust, Inc. can issue and sell common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 2.0 billion through various named agents from time to time. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Digital Realty Trust, Inc. generated net proceeds of approximately 983 million from the issuance of approximately 6.4 million common shares under the 2024 Sales Agreement Amendment at an average price of 154.84 per share before payment of approximately 9.9 million of commissions to the agents. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, Digital Realty Trust, Inc. generated net proceeds of approximately 62 million from the issuance of approximately 0.4 million common shares under the 2024 Sales Agreement Amendment at an average price of 160.81 per share after payment of approximately 0.6 million of commissions to the agents. As of October 30, 2024, approximately 0.9 billion remains available for future sales under the 2024 Sales Agreement Amendment. The sales of common stock made under the 2024 Sales Agreement Amendment will be made in at the market offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act. Our Parent has used and intends to use the net proceeds from the program to temporarily repay borrowings under our Operating Partnership s Global Revolving Credit Facilities, to acquire additional properties or businesses, to fund development opportunities and for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including potentially for the repayment of other debt or the repurchase, redemption or retirement of outstanding debt securities.

 On May 7, 2024, Digital Realty Trust, Inc. and Digital Realty Trust, L.P. entered into an underwriting agreement with BofA Securities, Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters relating to the sale of up to approximately 12.1 million shares of common stock (including approximately 1.6 million shares that the underwriters had the option to purchase, and which option was exercised in full on May 8, 2024), at a purchase price to the underwriters of 136.66 per share. The offering closed on May 10, 2024, and we received net proceeds of approximately 1.7 billion. We believe our Operating Partnership s sources of working capital, specifically its cash flow from operations, and funds available under its Global Revolving Credit Facility are adequate for it to make its distribution payments to our Parent and, in turn, for our Parent to make its dividend payments to its stockholders. However, we cannot assure you that our Operating Partnership s sources of capital will continue to be available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet its needs, including making distribution payments to our Parent. The lack of availability of capital could adversely affect our Operating Partnership s ability to pay its distributions to our Parent, which would in turn, adversely affect our Parent s ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders. Future Uses of Cash Parent Our Parent may from time to time seek to retire, redeem or repurchase its equity or the debt securities of our Operating Partnership or its subsidiaries through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, redemptions or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions or other factors. The amounts involved may be material. Dividends and Distributions Parent Our Parent is required to distribute 90 of its taxable income (excluding capital gains) on an annual basis to continue to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Our Parent intends to make, but is not contractually bound to make, regular quarterly distributions to its common stockholders from cash flow from our Operating Partnership s operating activities. While historically our Parent has satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash distributions to its stockholders, it may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or other property. All such distributions are at the discretion of our Parent s Board of Directors. Our Parent considers market factors and our Operating Partnership s performance in addition to REIT requirements in determining distribution levels. Our Parent has distributed at least 100 of its taxable income annually since inception to minimize corporate level federal and state income taxes. Amounts accumulated for distribution to stockholders are invested primarily in interest-bearing accounts and short-term interest-bearing securities, in a manner consistent with our intention to maintain our Parent s status as a REIT. As a result of this distribution requirement, our Operating Partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its ongoing operations to the same extent that other companies whose parent companies are not REITs can. Our Parent may need to continue to raise capital in the debt and equity markets to fund our Operating Partnership s working capital needs, as well as potential developments at new or existing properties, acquisitions or investments in existing or newly created joint ventures. In addition, our Parent may be required to use borrowings under the Operating Partnership s Global Revolving Credit Facility (which is guaranteed by our Parent), if necessary, to meet REIT distribution requirements and maintain our Parent s REIT status.

Table of Contents 
 Distributions out of our Parent s current or accumulated earnings and profits are generally classified as ordinary income except to the extent that our Parent recognizes capital gains and declares a capital gains dividend, or that such amounts constitute qualified dividend income subject to a reduced rate of tax. Non-corporate stockholders, including individuals, generally may deduct up to 20 of dividends from a REIT, other than capital gain dividends and dividends treated as qualified dividend income, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2026. Distributions in excess of our Parent s current and accumulated earnings and profits are generally classified as a return of capital to the extent of a stockholder s U.S. federal income tax basis in our Parent s stock. Distributions in excess of our Parent s current and accumulated earnings and profits and in excess of a stockholder s U.S. federal income tax basis in our Parent s stock are generally characterized as capital gain. Cash provided by operating activities has been generally sufficient to fund distributions on an annual basis. However, we may also need to utilize borrowings under the Global Revolving Credit Facility to fund distributions. For additional information regarding dividends declared and paid by our Parent on its common and preferred stock for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, see Note 10. Equity and Capital to our condensed consolidated financial statements contained herein. Analysis of Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Partnership As of September 30, 2024, we had 2,175.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, excluding 6.5 million of restricted cash. Restricted cash primarily consists of contractual capital expenditures plus other deposits. As circumstances warrant, our Operating Partnership may dispose of assets or enter into joint venture arrangements with institutional investors or strategic partners, on an opportunistic basis dependent upon market conditions. Our Operating Partnership may use the proceeds from such dispositions to acquire additional properties, to fund development opportunities and for general working capital purposes, including the repayment of indebtedness. Our liquidity requirements primarily consist of: operating expenses; development costs and other expenditures associated with our properties; distributions to our Parent to enable it to make dividend payments; distributions to unitholders of common limited partnership interests in Digital Realty Trust, L.P.; debt service; and potentially, acquisitions. On September 24, 2024, we refinanced our Global Revolving Credit Facility and Yen Revolving Credit Facility. The Global Revolving Credit Facilities provide for borrowings up to 4.5 billion (including approximately 0.3 billion available to be drawn on the Yen Revolving Credit Facility) based on currency commitments and foreign exchange rates as of September 30, 2024. The Global Revolving Credit Facility provides for borrowings in a variety of currencies and can be increased by an additional 1.8 billion, subject to receipt of lender commitments and other conditions precedent. Both facilities mature on January 24, 2029, with two six-month extension options available. These facilities also feature a sustainability-linked pricing component, with pricing subject to adjustment based on annual performance targets, further demonstrating our continued leadership and commitment to sustainable business practices. The Global Revolving Credit Facility provides for borrowings in a variety of currencies and includes the ability to add additional currencies in the future. We have used and intend to use available borrowings under the Global Revolving Credit Facilities to acquire additional properties, fund development opportunities and for general working capital and other corporate purposes, including potentially for the repurchase, redemption or retirement of outstanding debt or equity securities. For additional information regarding our Global Revolving Credit Facility, see Note 8. Debt of the Operating Partnership in the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Future Uses of Cash Our properties require periodic investments of capital for customer-related capital expenditures and for general capital improvements. Depending upon customer demand, we expect to incur significant improvement costs to build out and develop additional capacity. At September 30, 2024, we had open commitments, related to construction contracts of approximately 1.9 billion, including amounts reimbursable of approximately 62.5 million. We currently expect to incur approximately 0.4 billion to 0.6 billion of capital expenditures for our consolidated development programs during the remainder of 2024. This amount could go up or down, potentially materially, based on numerous factors, including changes in demand, leasing results and availability of debt or equity capital. Development Projects The costs we incur to develop our properties is a key component of our liquidity requirements. The following table summarizes our cumulative investments in current development projects as well as expected future investments in these projects as of the periods presented, excluding costs incurred or to be incurred by unconsolidated entities.

Future development reflects cumulative cost spent pending future development and includes ongoing improvements to building infrastructure in preparation for future data center fit-out. We expect to deliver the space within 12 months; however, lease commencement dates may significantly impact final delivery schedules.

 Capital Expenditures (Cash Basis) The table below summarizes our capital expenditure activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Development projects 1,732,337 2,121,583 Enhancement and improvements 21,859 5,592 Recurring capital expenditures 175,467 184,214 Total capital expenditures (excluding indirect costs) 1,929,663 2,311,389 Our development capital expenditures are generally funded by our available cash and equity and debt capital. Indirect costs, including interest, capitalized in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 166.7 million and 155.1 million, respectively. Capitalized interest comprised approximately 84.4 million and 83.8 million of the total indirect costs capitalized for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Capitalized interest in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased, compared to the same period in 2023, due to an increase in qualifying activities and higher interest rates. Excluding capitalized interest, indirect costs in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased compared to the same period in 2023 due primarily to capitalized amounts relating to compensation expense of employees directly engaged in construction activities. See Future Uses of Cash for a discussion of the amount of capital expenditures we expect to incur during the year ending December 31, 2024. Consistent with our growth strategy, we actively pursue potential acquisition opportunities, with due diligence and negotiations often at different stages at different times. The dollar value of acquisitions for the year ending December 31, 2024 will depend upon numerous factors, including customer demand, leasing results, availability of debt or equity capital and acquisition opportunities. Further, the growing acceptance by private institutional investors of the data center asset class has generally pushed capitalization rates lower, as such private investors may often have lower return expectations than us. As a result, we anticipate near-term single asset acquisitions activity to comprise a smaller percentage of our growth while this market dynamic persists. We may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt or the equity of our Parent through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities of our Parent in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend upon prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions or other factors. The amounts involved may be material. Sources of Cash We expect to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, including payment of scheduled debt maturities and funding of acquisitions and non-recurring capital improvements, with net cash from operations, future long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness and the issuance of equity and debt securities and the proceeds of equity issuances by our Parent. We also may fund future short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, including acquisitions and non-recurring capital improvements, using our Global Revolving Credit Facilities pending permanent financing. As of October 29, 2024, we had approximately 2.5 billion of borrowings available under our Global Revolving Credit Facilities.

 On September 13, 2024, Digital Dutch Finco B.V., an indirect wholly owned finance subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, issued and sold 850 million aggregate principal amount of 3.875 Guaranteed Notes due 2033. Net proceeds from the offering were approximately 843 million (approximately 933 million based on the exchange rate on September 13, 2024) after deducting managers discounts and estimated offering expenses. We used the net proceeds from the offering to pay down a portion of our Euro Term Loan Facilities, temporarily repay borrowings under our Global Revolving Credit Facility and for general corporate purposes. On July 13, 2023, we formed a joint venture with GI Partners, and GI Partners acquired a 65 interest in two stabilized hyperscale data center buildings in the Chicago metro area that we contributed. We retained a 35 interest in the joint venture. As a result of transferring control, we derecognized the data centers. In addition, GI Partners had a call option to increase their ownership interest in the joint venture from 65 to 80 . The call option top-up election notice was delivered to the Company on December 21, 2023. On January 12, 2024, GI Partners made an additional cash capital contribution, pursuant to the exercise of such call option, in the amount of 68 million, resulting in such additional 15 ownership in the joint venture. Currently, GI Partners has an 80 interest in the joint venture, and we have retained a 20 interest. We also granted GI Partners an option to purchase an interest in the third facility on the same hyperscale data center campus in Chicago. On April 16, 2024, we expanded our existing joint venture with GI Partners with the sale to GI Partners of a 75 interest in this third facility. We received approximately 386 million of net proceeds from the contribution of our data center to the joint venture and the associated financing and retained a 25 interest in the joint venture. On January 11, 2024, we formed a joint venture with Blackstone Inc. to develop four hyperscale data center campuses across Frankfurt, Paris and Northern Virginia. The campuses are planned to support the construction of 10 data centers with approximately 500 megawatts of potential IT load capacity. The first phase of the joint venture closed on hyperscale data center campuses in Paris and Northern Virginia, while the second phase is scheduled to close in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to obtaining the required approvals. We received approximately 231 million of net proceeds from the contribution of our data centers to the first phase of the joint venture and retained a 20 interest in the joint venture. Each partner funded its pro rata share of the remaining 3.0 billion estimated development cost for the first phase of the joint venture, which is slated for completion in various stages, contingent on customer demand, which began in the first quarter of 2024. In January 2024, we closed on the sale of our interest in four data centers to Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P., or Brookfield, for approximately 271 million. Two of the data centers were consolidated by us; while two of the data centers were owned by Digital Core REIT. The sale was completed subsequent to Brookfield s November 2023 acquisition of one of our customers, Cyxtera Technologies. The acquisition was part of Cyxtera s plan of reorganization under its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. In conjunction with the sale, we bought out Cyxtera s leases in three data centers located in Singapore and Frankfurt for approximately 57 million. In addition, Brookfield assumed the leases on three facilities previously leased to Cyxtera and amended the leases on three additional data centers in North America, accelerating the expiration date to September 2024. As a result of the sale, we recognized a total gain on disposition of approximately 203.1 million, of which 194.2 million is included within Gain on disposition of properties, net and 8.9 million is included within Equity in (loss) earnings of unconsolidated entities on our condensed consolidated income statements. On March 1, 2024, we formed a joint venture with Mitsubishi Corporation, or Mitsubishi, to support the development of two data centers in the Dallas metro area. The facilities were 100 pre-leased prior to construction. We contributed the two data center buildings at a contribution value of approximately 261 million. We received approximately 153 million of gross proceeds from the contribution of our data centers to the joint venture and retained a 35 interest in the joint venture. Mitsubishi contributed such cash in exchange for a 65 interest in the joint venture. Each partner funded its pro rata share of the remaining 140 million estimated development cost for the first phase of the project, of which one project has been completed in June 2024 and another is slated for completion in late 2024.

 On April 16, 2024, we expanded our existing joint venture with GI Partners with the sale to GI Partners of a 75 interest in a third facility on the same hyperscale data center campus in Chicago. We contributed the data center at a value of approximately 453 million. We received approximately 386 million of net proceeds from the contribution of our data center to the joint venture and the associated financing and retained a 25 interest in the joint venture. As a result of transferring control, we derecognized the data center and recognized a gain on disposition of approximately 172 million. Distributions All distributions on our units are at the discretion of our Parent s Board of Directors. For additional information regarding distributions paid on our common and preferred units for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, see Note 10. Equity and Capital to our condensed consolidated financial statements contained herein. Outstanding Consolidated Indebtedness The table below summarizes our outstanding debt as of September 30, 2024 (in millions): 

Debt Summary: Fixed rate 12,211 Variable rate debt subject to interest rate swaps 2,976 Total fixed rate debt (including interest rate swaps) 15,187 Variable rate unhedged 1,922 Total 17,109 Percent of Total Debt: Fixed rate (including swapped debt) 88.8 Variable rate 11.2 Total 100.0 Effective Interest Rate as of September 30, 2024 Fixed rate (including hedged variable rate debt) 2.70 Variable rate 4.10 Effective interest rate 2.86 Our ratio of debt to total enterprise value was approximately 23 (based on the closing price of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. s common stock on September 30, 2024 of 161.83). For this purpose, our total enterprise value is defined as the sum of the market value of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. s outstanding common stock (which may decrease, thereby increasing our debt to total enterprise value ratio), plus the liquidation value of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. s preferred stock, plus the aggregate value of Digital Realty Trust, L.P. units not held by Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (with the per unit value equal to the market value of one share of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. s common stock and excluding long-term incentive units, Class C units and Class D units), plus the book value of our total consolidated indebtedness. The variable rate debt shown above bears interest based on various one-month SOFR, EURIBOR, HIBOR, TIBOR, SARON and Base CD Rate rates, depending on the respective agreement governing the debt, including our Global Revolving Credit Facilities and unsecured term loans. As of September 30, 2024, our debt had a weighted average term to initial maturity of approximately 4.3 years (or approximately 4.5 years assuming exercise of extension options). As of September 30, 2024, our pro-rata share of secured debt of unconsolidated entities was approximately 1,479.5 million.

 Cash Flows The following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below. Comparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 The following table shows cash flows and ending cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balances for the respective periods (in thousands).

 The changes in the activities that comprise the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of the following amounts (in thousands). 

Change 2024 vs 2023 Increase in cash provided by short-term borrowings 412,911 Increase in cash provided by proceeds from secured / unsecured debt 199,748 Increase in cash used for repayment on secured / unsecured debt (1,613,272) Increase in cash provided by proceeds from issuance of common stock, net of costs 1,652,640 Increase in cash used for dividend and distribution payments (112,599) Other changes, net 90,781 Increase in net cash provided by financing activities 630,209 The increase in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to: (i) an increase in cash proceeds from short-term borrowings; (ii) an increase in cash provided by proceeds from secured / unsecured debt due to the issuance of the 3.875 Guaranteed Notes due 2033 (the 2033 Notes in September 2024, offset by the closing of the U.S. term loan facility in January 2023; (iii) an increase in cash used for repayment: 240 million on the U.S. term loan facility; 637 million on the Euro notes (2.625 notes due 2024); 324 million on the 2.750 notes due 2024; 415 million on the Euro Term Loan Facilities; (iv) an increase in cash provided by proceeds from the issuance of: approximately 7.0 million shares of common stock, net of costs, of approximately 1.1 billion under our ATM program; approximately 12.1 million shares of common stock, net of costs, of approximately 1.7 billion from our equity offering; offset by the issuance of approximately 11.3 million shares of common stock, net of costs, of approximately 1.1 billion under our ATM program in 2023; and (v) an increase in dividend and distribution payments due to an increased number of common shares and common units outstanding.

 Noncontrolling Interests in Operating Partnership Noncontrolling interests relate to the common units in Digital Realty Trust, L.P. that are not owned by Digital Realty Trust, Inc., which, as of September 30, 2024, amounted to 1.9 of Digital Realty Trust, L.P. common units. Historically, Digital Realty Trust, L.P. has issued common units to third party sellers in connection with our acquisition of real estate interests from such third parties. Limited partners have the right to require Digital Realty Trust, L.P. to redeem part or all of their common units for cash based on the fair market value of an equivalent number of shares of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. common stock at the time of redemption. Alternatively, Digital Realty Trust, Inc. may elect to acquire those common units in exchange for shares of its common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits, stock dividends, issuance of stock rights, specified extraordinary distributions and similar events. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 0.2 million common units and incentive units of Digital Realty Trust, L.P. are classified within equity, except for certain common units issued to certain former DuPont Fabros Technology, L.P. unitholders in the Company s acquisition of DuPont Fabros Technology, Inc., which are subject to certain restrictions and, accordingly, are not presented as permanent equity in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Inflation Many of our leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations. In addition, many of the leases provide for fixed base rent increases. We believe that inflationary increases may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and expense escalations described above. A period of inflation, however, could cause an increase in the cost of our variable-rate borrowings, including borrowings under our Global Revolving Credit Facilities, borrowings under our Euro Term Loan Facilities and USD Term Loan Facility and issuances of unsecured senior notes. Funds from Operations We calculate funds from operations, or FFO, in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (Nareit) in the Nareit Funds From Operations White Paper - 2018 Restatement. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gain (loss) from the disposition of real estate assets, provision for impairment, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), our share of unconsolidated JV real estate related depreciation amortization, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in operating partnership and, depreciation related to noncontrolling interests. Management uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our data centers that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and capitalized leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our data centers, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our financial condition and results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. Other REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the Nareit definition and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to other REITs FFO. FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance.

U.S. GAAP requires the Company to assume the put right is settled in shares for purposes of calculating diluted EPS. This same approach was utilized to calculate FFO per share. When calculating diluted FFO, Teraco related minority interest is added back to the FFO numerator as the denominator assumes all shares have been put back to the Company. The Teraco noncontrolling share of FFO was 9,828 and 11,537 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 32,049 and 32,251 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our future income, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments depend upon prevalent market interest rates. Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit ratings and other factors. Analysis of Debt between Fixed and Variable Rate We use interest rate swap agreements and fixed rate debt to reduce our exposure to interest rate movements. As of September 30, 2024, our consolidated debt was as follows (in millions): 

Estimated Fair Carrying Value Value Fixed rate debt 12,211 9,461 Variable rate debt subject to interest rate swaps 2,976 2,976 Total fixed rate debt (including interest rate swaps) 15,187 12,437 Variable rate debt 1,922 1,922 Total outstanding debt 17,109 14,359 Sensitivity to Changes in Interest Rates The following table shows the effect if assumed changes in interest rates occurred, based on fair values and interest expense as of September 30, 2024: 

Change Assumed event millions) Increase in fair value of interest rate swaps following an assumed 10 increase in interest rates 2 Decrease in fair value of interest rate swaps following an assumed 10 decrease in interest rates (2) Increase in annual interest expense on our debt that is variable rate and not subject to swapped interest following a 10 increase in interest rates 6 Decrease in annual interest expense on our debt that is variable rate and not subject to swapped interest following a 10 decrease in interest rates (6) Increase in fair value of fixed rate debt following a 10 decrease in interest rates (153) Decrease in fair value of fixed rate debt following a 10 increase in interest rates (145) Interest risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. These analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur in that environment. Further, in the event of a change of that magnitude, we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure.

 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We are subject to risk from the effects of exchange rate movements of a variety of foreign currencies, which may affect future costs and cash flows. Our primary currency exposures are to the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound sterling, Singapore dollar, South African rand and Brazilian real. Our exposure to foreign exchange risk related to the Brazilian real is limited to the impact that currency has on our share of the Ascenty entity s operations and financial position. We attempt to mitigate a portion of the risk of currency fluctuations by financing our investments in local currency denominations in order to reduce our exposure to any foreign currency transaction gains or losses resulting from transactions entered into in currencies other than the functional currencies of the associated entities. We also utilize cross-currency interest rate swaps, designated as net investment hedges, which effectively convert a portion of our U.S. dollar-denominated fixed-rate debt to foreign currency-denominated fixed-rate debt, to hedge the currency exposure associated with our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries. In addition, we may also hedge well-defined transactional exposures with foreign currency forwards or options, although there can be no assurances that these will be effective. As a result, changes in the relation of any such foreign currency to U.S. dollar may affect our revenues, operating margins and distributions and may also affect the book value of our assets and the amount of stockholders equity. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures (Digital Realty Trust, Inc.) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to its management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, the Company s management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and its management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Also, the Company has investments in certain unconsolidated entities, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. As the Company does not control or manage these entities, its disclosure controls and procedures with respect to such entities may be substantially more limited than those it maintains with respect to its consolidated subsidiaries. As required by Rule 13a-15(b) or Rule 15d-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, management of the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with participation of its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures that were in effect as of the end of the quarter covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, the Company s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during its most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.

on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.02 and, the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, notwithstanding the last sentence of Section 2.02(a), make available to the applicable Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender and the Borrowers severally agree to repay or pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount and to pay interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to any Borrower until the date such amount is repaid or paid to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of the Borrowers, the higher of (A) the interest rate applicable at such time under Section 2.07 to Advances comprising such Borrowing and (B) the cost of funds incurred by the Administrative Agent in respect of such amount in the case of Advances denominated in Committed Foreign Currencies and (ii) in the case of such Lender, (A) the Federal Funds Rate in the case of Advances under the U.S. Dollar Revolving Credit Tranche or (B) the cost of funds incurred by the Administrative Agent in respect of such amount in the case of all other Advances. If such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Advance as part of such Borrowing for all purposes. 
 (e) The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Advance on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing. 
 (f) The Borrowers irrevocably and for value authorize each Australian Dollar Revolving Lender (at the option of such Lender) from time to time (i) to prepare reliquification bills of exchange in relation to any Australian Dollar Revolving Credit Advance and (ii) to sign them as drawer or endorser in the name of and on behalf of any Borrower provided that the relevant Borrower s obligations as drawer or endorser under any such reliquification bill is non-recourse). The total face amount of reliquification bills prepared by any such Lender and outstanding in relation to any such Advance must not at any time exceed (A) such Lender s share of the principal amount of such Advance plus (B) the total interest on that share over the relevant Interest Period. Reliquification bills must mature on or before the last day of the relevant Interest Period. Each such Lender may realize or deal with any reliquification bill prepared by it as it thinks fit. Each such Lender shall indemnify the Borrowers on demand against all liabilities, costs and expenses incurred by any Borrower by reason of it being a party to a reliquification bill prepared by such Lender. The immediately preceding sentence shall not affect any obligation of the Borrowers under any Loan Document. In particular, the obligations of the Borrowers to make payments under the Loan Documents are not in any way affected by any liability of any Lender, contingent or otherwise, under the indemnity in this Section 2.02(g). If a reliquification bill prepared by any such Lender is presented to a Borrower and such Borrower discharges it by payment, the amount of that payment will be deemed to have been applied against the moneys payable to such Lender hereunder.

Each Borrower shall be liable for the Advances made to such Borrower only, provided that (x) if an Advance is made to more than one Borrower, all such Borrowers shall be jointly and severally liable with respect to such Advance 

and (y) nothing in this sentence shall impair or limit the liability or obligations of the Operating Partnership in its capacity as a Guarantor hereunder. 
 (h) Each Lender may, at its option, make any Advance available to any Borrower by causing any foreign or domestic branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Advance; provided , however , that (i) any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of such Borrower in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (ii) nothing in this Section 2.02(i) shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Advance in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation or warranty by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Advance in any particular place or manner.

 (b) (i) If, with respect to any Term SOFR Advances or Daily RFR Advances under the U.S. Dollar Revolving Credit Tranche, the Tranche Required Lenders for the U.S. Dollar Revolving Credit Tranche notify the Administrative Agent that Term SOFR for any Interest Period for such Advances or the Daily RFR Rate, as applicable, will not adequately reflect the cost to such Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their Term SOFR Advances for such Interest Period or Daily RFR Advances, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith so notify the Borrowers and the Lenders, whereupon (i) each such Term SOFR Advance and/or Daily RFR Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor in the case of Term SOFR Advances and immediately in the case of Daily RFR Advances, Convert into a Base Rate Advance, and (ii) the obligation of the Lenders under the U.S. Dollar Revolving Credit Tranche to make or to Convert Advances into, Term SOFR Advances or Daily RFR Advances (as applicable) shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrowers that such Lenders have determined that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist. 
 (c) (i) If, with respect to any Floating Rate Advances not described in Section 2.10(c)(i), the Tranche Required Lenders for any Tranche other than the U.S. Dollar Revolving Credit Tranche notify the Administrative Agent that the Floating Rate for any Interest Period for such Advances will not adequately reflect the cost to such Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their Floating Rate Advances for such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith so notify the Borrowers and the Lenders, whereupon (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make such Floating Rate Advances shall be suspended and (y) with respect to any Floating Rate Advances that are then outstanding under any Tranche (other than the U.S. Dollar Revolving Credit Tranche), such Floating Rate Advances shall thereafter bear interest at the applicable Central Bank Rate for such currency plus the Applicable Margin, in each case until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrowers that such Lenders have determined that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist. 
 (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation shall make it unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental authority shall assert that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its Applicable Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to (I) make Floating Rate Advances or to fund or continue to fund or maintain Floating Rate Advances in any currency hereunder or if the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation shall make it unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental authority shall assert that it is 

unlawful for any Lender to purchase or sell or to take deposits of, any applicable currency in the Relevant Interbank Market, then, on notice thereof and demand therefor by such Lender to the Borrowers through the Administrative Agent, (A) each Floating Rate Advance by such Lender made pursuant to the U.S. Dollar Revolving Credit Tranche will automatically, upon such demand, Convert into a Base Rate Advance, (B) any other Floating Rate Advances denominated in a Committed Foreign Currency shall, solely for the purpose of calculating the interest rate applicable to such Floating Rate Advances, be deemed to be Floating Rate Advances denominated in Dollars and shall accrue interest at the same interest rate applicable to Floating Rate Advances denominated in Dollars at such time and (C) the obligation of such Lender to make, continue or Convert Advances into, Floating Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrowers that such Lender has determined that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist or (II) make Daily RFR Advances or to fund or continue to fund or maintain Daily RFR Advances in any currency hereunder, then, on notice thereof and demand therefor by such Lender to the Borrowers through the Administrative Agent, (A) the obligation of such Lender to make, continue or Convert Advances into, Daily RFR Advances shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrowers that such Lender has determined that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist and (B) all Daily RFR Advances shall, solely for the purpose of calculating the interest rate applicable to such Daily RFR Advances, be deemed to be Floating Rate Advances denominated in Dollars and shall accrue interest at the same interest rate applicable to Floating Rate Advances denominated in Dollars at such time ; provided , however , that in each case, before making any such demand, such Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Applicable Lending Office if the making of such a designation would allow such Lender or its Applicable Lending Office to continue to perform its obligations to make Floating Rate Advances or to continue to fund or maintain Floating Rate Advances and would not, in the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. The Conversion of any Floating Rate Advance of any Lender to a Base Rate Advance or the suspension of any obligation of any Lender to make any Floating Rate Advance pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.10(d) shall not affect the obligation of any other Lender to continue to make Floating Rate Advances in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 
 (e) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender Party to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.10 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender Party s right to demand such compensation; provided , however , that no Borrower shall be required to compensate a Lender Party pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.10 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender Party, notifies the Operating Partnership of the event or circumstance giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender Party s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the event or circumstance giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 
 (f) If (i) any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, (ii) any Lender requests compensation pursuant to Section 2.10(a) or Section 2.10(b), (iii) any Lender gives notice pursuant to Section 2.10(c) or Section 2.10(d), (iv) any Borrower is required to pay Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any governmental authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.12 or (v) any amount payable to any Lender by a French Borrower is not, or will not be (when the relevant corporate income tax is calculated) treated as a deductible charge or expense for French tax purposes for that Borrower by reason of that amount being (A) paid or accrued to a Lender incorporated, domiciled, established or acting through a lending office situated in a Non-Cooperative Jurisdiction, or (B) paid to an account opened in the name of or for the benefit of that Lender in a financial institution situated in a Non-Cooperative Jurisdiction (any such Lender, an Affected Lender ), then the Operating Partnership shall have the right, upon written demand to such Affected Lender and the Administrative Agent at any time thereafter to cause such Affected Lender to assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, its Commitment or Commitments, the Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes, if any, held by it) to a Replacement Lender, provided that the proposed assignment does not conflict with applicable laws. The Replacement Lender shall purchase such interests of the Affected Lender at par and shall assume the rights and obligations of the Affected Lender under this Agreement upon execution 

by the Replacement Lender of an Assignment and Acceptance delivered pursuant to Section 9.07; provided , however , the Affected Lender shall be entitled to indemnification as otherwise provided in this Agreement with respect to any events occurring prior to such assignment. Any Lender that becomes an Affected Lender agrees that, upon receipt of notice from the Borrowers given in accordance with this Section 2.10(g) it shall promptly execute and deliver an Assignment and Acceptance with a Replacement Lender as contemplated by this Section 2.10(g). The execution and delivery of any such Assignment and Acceptance shall not be deemed to comprise a waiver of claims against any Affected Lender by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent or a waiver of any claims against the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent by the Affected Lender. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Lender shall not be required to make any assignment pursuant to this Section 2.10(g) if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Operating Partnership to require such assignment cease to apply. 
 SECTION 2.11. Payments and Computations . (k) The Borrowers shall make each payment hereunder with respect to principal of, interest on, and other amounts relating to, Advances under the (I) U.S. Dollar Revolving Credit Tranche not later than 2:00 P.M.

(local time), in each case, on the day when due, irrespective of any right of counterclaim or set-off (except as otherwise provided in Section 2.12), to the Administrative Agent at the applicable Administrative Agent s Account in same day funds, with payments being received by the Administrative Agent after such time being deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day. Each payment shall be made by the Borrowers in the currency of the applicable Advance to which the applicable payment relates, except to the extent required otherwise hereunder, and the Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to accept a payment that is not in the correct currency. The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause like funds to be distributed (i) if such payment by any Borrower is in respect of principal, interest, commitment fees or any other Obligation then payable hereunder and under the other Loan Documents to more than one Lender Party, to such Lender Parties for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices ratably in accordance with the amounts of such respective Obligations then payable to such Lender Parties in accordance with the applicable Standing Payment Instructions and (ii) if such payment by any Borrower is in respect of any Obligation then payable hereunder to one Lender Party, to such Lender Party for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon any Acceding Lender becoming a Lender hereunder as a result of a Commitment Increase pursuant to Section 2.18, a Reallocation pursuant to Section 2.19 or making a Supplemental Tranche Commitment pursuant to Section 2.20 and upon the Administrative Agent s receipt of such Lender s Lender Accession Agreement and recording of the information contained therein in the Register, from and after the applicable Increase Date, the Administrative Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under any Notes issued in connection therewith in respect of the interest assumed thereby in accordance with the applicable Standing Payment Instructions. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 9.07(d), from and after the applicable Transfer Date, the Administrative Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under any Notes issued in connection therewith in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender Party assignee thereunder in accordance with such Lender assignee s Standing Payment Instructions, and the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves. In respect of any assignment pursuant to Section 9.07, the effective date of which, in each case, is not on the last day of an Interest Period (A) any interest or fees in respect of the relevant assigned interest in the Facility that are expressed to accrue by reference to the lapse of time shall continue to accrue in favor of the assignor Lender up to but excluding the Transfer Date (the Accrued Amounts and shall become 

due and payable to the assignor Lender without further interest accruing on them on the last day of the current Interest Period (or, if the Interest Period is longer than six calendar months, on the next of the dates which falls at six monthly intervals after the first day of that Interest Period) and (B) the rights assigned or transferred by the assignor Lender will not include the right to the Accrued Amounts so that, for the avoidance of doubt: (1) when the Accrued Amounts become payable, those Accrued Amounts will be payable for the account of the assignor Lender and (2) the amount payable to the assignee Lender on that date will be the amount which would, but for the application of this Section 2.11(a), have been payable to it on that date, but after deduction of the Accrued Amounts. (a) The Administrative Agent shall ensure that its accounts at such office or bank at which and from which payments to be made under this Agreement to Lenders that are funding the Advances to a French Borrower are not located in a country which is qualified as a Non-Cooperative Jurisdiction. 
 (b) (i) All computations of interest (x) based on the Base Rate and (y) on Advances denominated in Canadian Dollars (subject to clause (iv) below), and any other Committed Foreign Currency where the practice in the Relevant Interbank Market is to compute interest on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, shall, in each case, be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest is payable . 
 (i) All computations of (A) interest on Advances based on Term SOFR, Daily Simple SOFR or the Federal Funds Rate, interest on Advances denominated in Dollars under the Australian Dollar Revolving Credit Tranche and on Advances denominated in Yen, IDR, Euro, Swiss Francs, Singapore Dollars or any other Committed Foreign Currency where the practice in the Relevant Interbank Market is to compute interest on the basis of a year of 360 days and (B) of fees and Letter of Credit commissions shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest, fees or commissions are payable. 
 (ii) All computation of interest on Advances denominated in Sterling, Singapore Dollars, Australian Dollars, Hong Kong Dollars, Korean Won or any other Committed Foreign Currency where the practice in the Relevant Interbank Market is to compute interest on the basis of a year of 365 days shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 365 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest is payable. 
 (iii) For the purpose of complying with the Interest Act (Canada), it is expressly agreed that with respect to Advances denominated in Canadian Dollars only (i) where interest is calculated pursuant hereto at a rate based on a 360 or 365 day period, the yearly rate or percentage of interest to which such rate is equivalent is such rate multiplied by the actual number of days in the year (365 or 366, as the case may be) divided by 360 or 365 as relevant and (ii) the annual rates of interest to which the rates determined in accordance with the provisions hereof on the basis of a period of calculation less than a year are equivalent, are the rates so determined (x) multiplied by the actual number of days in the one (1) year period beginning on the first day of the period of calculation, and (y) divided by the number of days in the period of calculation. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate, fee or commission hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. 
 (c) Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or commitment fee, as the case 

may be; provided , however , that (i) if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Floating Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day and (ii) with respect to any Daily RFR Advance, this clause (d) shall be subject to the definition of Daily RFR Interest Payment Date . 
 (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from any Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to any Lender Party hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each such Lender Party on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender Party. If and to the extent such Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each such Lender Party shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender Party together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender Party until the date such Lender Party repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at (i) the Federal Funds Rate in the case of Advances under the U.S. Dollar Revolving Credit Tranche or (ii) the cost of funds incurred by the Administrative Agent in respect of such amount in the case of all other Advances. 
 (e) To the extent that the Administrative Agent receives funds for application to the amounts owing by any Borrower under or in respect of this Agreement or any Note in currencies other than the currency or currencies required to enable the Administrative Agent to distribute funds to the Lenders in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.11, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to convert or exchange such funds into Dollars or into a Committed Foreign Currency or from Dollars to a Committed Foreign Currency or from a Committed Foreign Currency to Dollars, as the case may be, to the extent necessary to enable the Administrative Agent to distribute such funds in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.11, provided that the Borrowers and each of the Lenders hereby agree that the Administrative Agent shall not be liable or responsible for any loss, cost or expense suffered by the Borrowers or such Lender as a result of any conversion or exchange of currencies effected pursuant to this Section 2.11(f) or as a result of the failure of the Administrative Agent to effect any such conversion or exchange; provided further that the Borrowers agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, and hold the Administrative Agent and each Lender harmless, for any and all losses, costs and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Lender for any conversion or exchange of currencies (or the failure to convert or exchange any currencies) in accordance with this Section 2.11(f) save to the extent that it is found in a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such loss, cost or expense resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent or such Lender. 
 (f) Whenever any payment received by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents is insufficient to pay in full all amounts due and payable to the Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties under or in respect of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on any date, such payment shall be distributed by the Administrative Agent and applied by the Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties in the order of priority set forth below in this Section 2.11(g). Payments to the Lenders shall be in accordance with the applicable Standing Payment Instructions. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, Advances denominated in Committed Foreign Currencies will, at any time during the continuance of such Event of Default that the Administrative Agent determines it necessary or desirable to calculate the pro rata share of the Lenders on a Facility-wide basis, be converted on a notional basis into the Equivalent amount of Dollars solely for the purposes of making any allocations required under this Section 2.11(g) and Section 2.13(b). The order of priority shall be as follows:

 (x) tenth , the remainder, if any, to the Borrowers for their own account. 
 SECTION 2.12. Taxes (l) Any and all payments by any Borrower hereunder or under the Notes shall be made, in accordance with Section 2.11, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings imposed by any Applicable Governmental Authority, and all liabilities with respect thereto (collectively, Taxes ), excluding (i) in the case of each Lender Party and the Administrative Agent, Taxes that are imposed on or measured by its net income by the United States (including branch profits Taxes or alternative minimum Tax) and Taxes that are imposed on or

(a) A payment shall not be increased under subsection (a) above by reason of a UK Tax Deduction, if on the date on which the payment falls due: 
 (i) the payment could have been made to the relevant Lender Party without a UK Tax Deduction if the Lender Party had been a UK Qualifying Lender, but on that date that Lender Party is not or has ceased to be a UK Qualifying Lender other than as a result of any change after the date it became a Lender Party under this Agreement in (or in the interpretation, administration, or application 

of) any law or double taxation agreement or any published practice or published concession of any relevant taxing authority; or 
 (ii) the relevant Lender Party is a UK Qualifying Lender solely by virtue of subsection (b) of the definition of UK Qualifying Lender and: (A) an officer of HM Revenue Customs has given (and not revoked) a direction (a Direction under section 931 of the UK ITA which relates to the payment and that Lender has received from the UK Borrower making the payment a certified copy of that Direction; and (B) the payment could have been made to the Lender without any UK Tax Deduction if that Direction had not been made; or

The Administrative Agent or such Lender Party, as applicable, will promptly provide to the applicable Loan Party a tax invoice complying with the relevant law relating to that Indirect Tax; provided , however , that with respect to the Multicurrency Revolving Credit Tranche and the Subfacilities thereunder, the applicable Lender Party and not the Administrative Agent shall provide any such tax invoices to the applicable Loan Party. 
 (d) Without duplication of Sections 2.12(a) or 2.12(d) and subject to Sections 2.12(b) and 2.12(c), the Borrowers shall indemnify each Lender Party and the Administrative Agent for and hold them harmless against the full amount of Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes, and for the full amount of Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes imposed on amounts payable under this Section 2.12, imposed on or paid by such Lender Party or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including penalties, additions to tax, interest and reasonable expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such Lender Party or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor; provided , however , that the Borrowers shall not be obligated to make payment to any Lender Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, pursuant to this Section 2.12 in respect of any penalties, interest and other liabilities attributable to Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes to the extent such penalties, interest and other liabilities are attributable to (i) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Lender Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, or (ii) a material breach by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in bad faith of such party s obligations hereunder, in either case as found in a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. 
 (e) As soon as practicable after the date of any payment of Taxes by the Borrowers to any Applicable Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 2.12, the Borrowers shall furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing such payment or, if such receipts are not obtainable, other evidence of such payments by the Borrowers reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 
 (f) (i) Any Lender Party (which, for purposes of this Section 2.12(g) shall include the Administrative Agent) that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent, upon becoming a party to this Agreement and at the time or times reasonably requested by any Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. Each UK Treaty Lender and each UK Borrower which makes a payment to which such Treaty Lender is entitled shall co-operate in completing any procedural formalities necessary for such UK Borrower to obtain authorization to make such payment without a UK Tax Deduction. In addition, any Lender 

Party, upon becoming a party to this Agreement and if reasonably requested by a Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable such Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such entity is subject to withholding or information reporting requirements with respect to such Lender Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any form or document referred to in this subsection (g) (other than any form or document referred to in subsection (g)(ii)(A), (B), (D) or (g)(iv) of this Section 2.12) requires the disclosure of information that the applicable Lender Party reasonably considers to be confidential, such Lender Party shall give notice thereof to the Borrowers and shall not be obligated to include in such form or document such confidential information. 
 (i) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (A) any Lender Party that is a U.S. person (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code) shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender Party becomes a Lender Party under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent), duly completed and signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 certifying that such Lender Party is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding; (B) each Lender Party that is not a U.S. person (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code) (each, a Foreign Lender shall, to the extent that it is legally entitled to do so, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Initial Lender, and on the Transfer Date with respect to the Assignment and Acceptance or the date of the Lender Accession Agreement pursuant to which it becomes a Lender Party in the case of each other Lender Party, and from time to time thereafter as requested in writing by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent (but only so long thereafter as such Lender Party remains lawfully able to do so), provide each of the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers (1) in the case of a Foreign Lender that is not a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, (x) a statement in a form agreed to between the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers to the effect that such Lender is eligible for a complete exemption from withholding of United States Taxes under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, and (y) two duly completed and signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E or successor and related applicable form; or (2) in the case of a Foreign Lender that cannot comply with the requirements of clause (1) hereof, two duly completed and signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (claiming an exemption from or a reduction in United States withholding tax under an applicable treaty) or its successor form, Form W-8ECI (claiming an exemption from United States withholding tax as effectively connected income) or its successor form, or Form W-8IMY (together with any supporting documentation) or its successor form, and related applicable forms, as the case may be; (C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender Party under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of any Borrower or the Administrative Agent), duly completed and signed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and (D) if a payment made to a Lender Party under any Loan Document would be subject to withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender Party were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, as applicable), such Lender Party shall deliver to the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by any Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for such Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender Party has complied with such 

Lender Party s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for the purposes of this subsection (g), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 
 (ii) Each Lender Party shall promptly notify the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances that would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption from or reduction of Taxes. Each Lender Party further agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. 
 (iii) A UK Treaty Lender that holds a passport under the HM Revenue Customs DT Treaty Passport scheme, and which wishes that scheme to apply to this Agreement, shall confirm in writing its scheme reference number and its jurisdiction of tax residence to any UK Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and, having done so, that Lender Party shall be under no obligation pursuant to subsection (i) above in respect of an Advance to any such UK Borrower. If a UK Treaty Lender has confirmed its scheme reference number and its jurisdiction of tax residence in accordance with this subsection (iv) and: (a) a UK Borrower making a payment to that Lender Party has not made a UK Borrower DTTP Filing in respect of that Lender Party; or (b) a UK Borrower making a payment to that Lender Party has made a UK Borrower DTTP Filing but (A) that UK Borrower DTTP Filing has been rejected by HM Revenue Customs; or (B) HM Revenue Customs have not given the UK Borrower authority to make payments to that Lender Party without a UK Tax Deduction within 60 days of the date of the UK Borrower DTTP Filing, and in each case, the UK Borrower has notified that Lender Party in writing, that Lender Party and the UK Borrower shall co-operate in completing any procedural formalities necessary for that UK Borrower to obtain authorization to make that payment without a UK Tax Deduction. 
 (iv) If a UK Treaty Lender has not confirmed its scheme reference number and jurisdiction of tax residence in accordance with subsection (iv) above, no UK Borrower shall make a UK Borrower DTTP Filing or file any other form relating to the HM Revenue Customs DT Treaty Passport scheme in respect of that Lender Party s Advance(s) unless that Lender Party otherwise agrees. 
 (v) A UK Borrower shall, promptly on making a UK Borrower DTTP Filing, deliver a copy of that UK Borrower DTTP Filing to the Administrative Agent for delivery to the relevant UK Treaty Lender. 
 (vi) A UK Qualifying Non-Bank Lender which becomes a party to this Agreement gives a UK Tax Confirmation to any UK Borrower by entering into this Agreement. A UK Qualifying Non-Bank Lender shall promptly notify any UK Borrower and the Administrative Agent if there is any change in the position from that set out in the UK Tax Confirmation. 
 (vii) Each Lender Party in respect of a UK Borrower which becomes a party to this Agreement shall indicate in Schedule I or (as applicable) the Assignment and Acceptance, which of the following categories it falls in: (A) not a UK Qualifying Lender; (B) a UK Qualifying Lender (other than a UK Treaty Lender); or (C) a UK Treaty Lender (on the assumption that all necessary procedural formalities have been completed). If a Lender Party fails to indicate its status in accordance with this subsection (viii) then such Lender Party shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement (including by each UK Borrower) as if it is not a UK Qualifying Lender until such time as it notifies the Administrative Agent which category applies (and the Administrative Agent, upon receipt of such notification, shall inform each UK Borrower). 

(viii) Each Lender Party which becomes a party to this Agreement after the date of this Agreement shall indicate, in the transfer agreement which it executes on becoming a party, and for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, which of the following categories it falls in: (A) not a French Qualifying Lender; (B) a French Qualifying Lender (other than a French Treaty Lender); or (C) a French Treaty Lender. If such new Lender Party fails to indicate its status in accordance with this Section 2.12(g)(ix) then such new Lender Party shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement as if it is not a French Qualifying Lender until such time as it notifies the Administrative Agent which category applies (and the Administrative Agent, upon receipt of such notification, shall inform the Operating Partnership). For the avoidance of doubt, a transfer agreement shall not be invalidated by any failure of a Lender Party to comply with this Section 2.12(g)(ix). 
 (g) Any Lender Party claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.12 agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender Party, (x) be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender Party or (y) subject such Lender Party to any material unreimbursed cost or expense. If any amount payable under this Agreement by a French Borrower becomes not deductible from that Borrower s taxable income for French tax purposes by reason of that amount being (i) paid or accrued to a Lender Party incorporated, domiciled, established or acting through a lending office situated in a Non-Cooperative Jurisdiction or (ii) paid to an account opened in the name of or for the benefit of that Lender Party in a financial institution situated in a Non-Cooperative Jurisdiction, then such Lender Party will use reasonable efforts to mitigate such issues including by designating a different lending office for each affected Advance if such designation would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and would not be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender Party. 
 (h) If any Lender Party or the Administrative Agent receives a refund of Taxes or Other Taxes paid by any Borrower or for which the Borrowers have indemnified any Lender Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, pursuant to this Section 2.12, then such Lender Party or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall pay such amount, net of any reasonable expenses incurred by such Lender Party or the Administrative Agent, to the Borrowers as soon as practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Borrowers shall not be entitled to review the tax records or financial information of any Lender Party or the Administrative Agent and (ii) neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender Party shall have any obligation to pursue (and no Loan Party shall have any right to assert) any refund of Taxes or Other Taxes that may be paid by the Borrowers. 
 (i) To the extent permitted under the Internal Revenue Code and the applicable Treasury Regulations, the Administrative Agent shall (i) act as the withholding agent solely with respect to the U.S. Dollar Revolving Credit Tranche contemplated by the Loan Documents, taking into account that each of the Borrowers (other than the Operating Partnership, Digital US Finco, the Initial Multicurrency Borrower 3, Initial Multicurrency Borrower 5 and the Initial Singapore Borrower 3) as of the date hereof is intended to be treated as an entity disregarded as separate from the Operating Partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and (ii) prepare and file (on behalf of the Borrowers), and furnish to the applicable Lender Parties, any required Internal Revenue Service Form 1042-S with respect to the U.S. Dollar Revolving Credit Tranche. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, the Administrative Agent shall not act as withholding agent (within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code and the applicable Treasury Regulations) with respect to any Tranche; provided , however , that if in the future, the Administrative Agent or an affiliate of the Administrative Agent that is a U.S. Person for U.S. federal income tax purposes administers another Tranche, the Administrative Agent or such affiliate shall (i) act as withholding agent (within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code and the applicable Treasury Regulations) with respect to such Tranche as required by law and (ii) prepare and file (on behalf of the Borrowers) and furnish to the applicable Lender Parties any required Internal Revenue Service Form 1042 S with respect to such Tranche. The Administrative Agent and the Borrowers further agree to mutually cooperate and furnish or cause to be furnished upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and 

assistance reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax returns and complying with all Tax withholding and information reporting requirements. With respect to each Tranche and each Borrower, the Administrative Agent agrees to provide the Borrowers information regarding the interest, principal, fees or other amounts payable to each Person pursuant to the Loan Documents by January 31 of each year following the year during which such payment was made. 
 (j) For purposes of this Section 2.12 (except for purposes of the first sentence of paragraph (i)), references to the Administrative Agent shall include any Affiliate or sub-agent of the Administrative Agent, in each case performing any duties or obligations of the Administrative Agent. For purposes of this Section 2.12, the term applicable law includes FATCA. 
 SECTION 2.13. Sharing of Payments, Etc. (m) Sharing Within Each Tranche . Subject to the provisions of Section 2.11(g), if, in connection with any particular Tranche, any Applicable Lender Party shall obtain at any time any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise, other than as a result of an assignment pursuant to Section 9.07 or a payment made by a Loan Party pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement) (a) on account of Obligations due and payable to such Applicable Lender Party with respect to such Tranche under the Loan Documents at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations due and payable to such Applicable Lender Party at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the Obligations due and payable to all Applicable Lender Parties with respect to such Tranche under the Loan Documents at such time) of payments on account of the Obligations due and payable to all such Applicable Lender Parties under the Loan Documents at such time obtained by all such Applicable Lender Parties at such time or (b) on account of Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to such Applicable Lender Party under the Loan Documents at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations owing to such Applicable Lender Party at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to all such Applicable Lender Parties hereunder at such time) of payments on account of the Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to all such Applicable Lender Parties under the Loan Documents at such time obtained by all of such Applicable Lender Parties at such time, such Applicable Lender Party shall forthwith purchase from such other Applicable Lender Parties such interests or participating interests in the Obligations due and payable or owing to them, as the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Applicable Lender Party to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided , however , that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Applicable Lender Party, such purchase from each other Applicable Lender Party shall be rescinded and such other Applicable Lender Party shall repay to the purchasing Applicable Lender Party the purchase price to the extent of such Applicable Lender Party s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the purchase price paid to such Applicable Lender Party to (ii) the aggregate purchase price paid to all Applicable Lender Parties) of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Applicable Lender Party s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such other Applicable Lender Party s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Applicable Lender Party) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Applicable Lender Party in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrowers agree that any Applicable Lender Party so purchasing an interest or participating interest from another Applicable Lender Party pursuant to this Section 2.13(a) may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such interest or participating interest, as the case may be, as fully as if such Applicable Lender Party were the direct creditor of the Borrowers in the amount of such interest or participating interest, as the case may be. 
 (a) Pro Rata Sharing Following Event of Default . Notwithstanding Section 2.13(a), following the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default and the notional conversion of all Advances denominated in a Committed Foreign Currency into Dollars pursuant to Section 2.11(g), subject to the provisions of Section 2.11(g), if any Lender Party shall obtain at any time any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set off, or otherwise, other than as a result of an assignment pursuant to Section 9.07 or a payment made by a Loan Party pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms 

of this Agreement) (a) on account of Obligations due and payable to such Lender Party under the Loan Documents at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations due and payable to such Lender Party at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the Obligations due and payable to all Lender Parties under the Loan Documents at such time) of payments on account of the Obligations due and payable to all Lender Parties under the Loan Documents at such time obtained by all the Lender Parties at such time or (b) on account of Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to such Lender Party under the Loan Documents at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations owing to such Lender Party at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to all Lender Parties under the Loan Documents at such time) of payments on account of the Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to all Lender Parties under the Loan Documents at such time obtained by all of the Lender Parties at such time, such Lender Party shall forthwith purchase from the other Lender Parties such interests or participating interests in the Obligations due and payable or owing to them, as the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender Party to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided , however , that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender Party, such purchase from each other Lender Party shall be rescinded and such other Lender Party shall repay to the purchasing Lender Party the purchase price to the extent of such Lender Party s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the purchase price paid to such Lender Party to (ii) the aggregate purchase price paid to all Lender Parties) of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender Party s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such other Lender Party s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender Party) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender Party in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrowers agree that any Lender Party so purchasing an interest or participating interest from another Lender Party pursuant to this Section 2.13(b) may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such interest or participating interest, as the case may be, as fully as if such Lender Party were the direct creditor of the Borrowers in the amount of such interest or participating interest, as the case may be. 
 SECTION 2.14. Use of Proceeds . The proceeds of the Advances and issuances of Letters of Credit shall be available (and the Borrowers agree that they shall use such proceeds and Letters of Credit) solely for the acquisition, development and redevelopment of Assets, for repayment of Debt, for working capital and for other general corporate purposes of the Parent Guarantor, the Borrowers and their respective Subsidiaries; provided , however , that (a) the proceeds of Advances and Letters of Credit under the KRW-A Revolving Credit Tranche shall be available solely for the purposes of Korean Working Capital and (b) the proceeds of Advances and Letters of Credit under the KRW-B Revolving Credit Tranche shall be available solely for the purposes of Korean Capital Expenditures. The Borrowers will not directly or knowingly indirectly use the Letters of Credit or the proceeds of the Advances, or lend, contribute or otherwise make available to any Subsidiary, joint venture partner or other Person such extensions of credit or proceeds, (i) to fund any prohibited activities or businesses of or with any Person that at the time of such funding is the target of or subject of Sanctions or in a Sanctioned Jurisdiction, or (ii) in any other manner that would result in a violation of Sanctions by any Person (including any Person participating in the Facility, whether as underwriter, advisor, investor, or otherwise) or any Anti-Corruption Laws. 
 SECTION 2.15. Evidence of Debt . (n) Each Lender Party shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of each applicable Borrower to such Lender Party resulting from each Advance owing to such Lender Party from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender Party from time to time hereunder. The Borrowers agree that upon notice by any Lender Party to any Borrower (with a copy of such notice to the Administrative Agent) to the effect that a promissory note or other evidence of indebtedness is required or appropriate in order for such Lender Party to evidence (whether for purposes of pledge, enforcement or otherwise) the Advances owing to, or to be made by, such Lender Party, the applicable Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to such Lender Party, with a copy to the Administrative Agent, a Note, in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto, payable to 

such Lender Party in a principal amount equal to the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Lender Party. All references to Notes in the Loan Documents shall mean Notes, if any, to the extent issued hereunder. In the event and to the extent that the provisions of any Note shall conflict with this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall govern. (a) The Register maintained by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 9.07(d) may include a control account and a subsidiary account for each Lender Party. In each account with respect to each Lender Party (including the control account and subsidiary account, if applicable) there shall be recorded (i) the date and amount of each Borrowing made hereunder, the Type of Advances comprising such Borrowing and, if appropriate, the Interest Period or tenor applicable thereto, (ii) the terms of each Assignment and Acceptance and Lender Accession Agreement delivered to and accepted by it, (iii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each Lender Party hereunder, and (iv) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent from the Borrowers hereunder and each Lender Party s share thereof. 
 (b) Entries made in good faith by the Administrative Agent in the Register pursuant to subsection (b) above, and by each Lender Party in its account or accounts pursuant to subsection (a) above, shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrowers to, in the case of the Register, each Lender Party and, in the case of such account or accounts, such Lender Party, under this Agreement, absent manifest error; provided , however , that the failure of the Administrative Agent or such Lender Party to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the Register or such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement. It is the intention of the parties hereto that the Advances will be treated as in registered form within the meaning of Sections 163(f), 871(h)(2) and 881(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code (and any other relevant or successor provisions of the Internal Revenue Code). 
 SECTION 2.16. Extension of Termination Date . The Borrowers may request, by written notice to the Administrative Agent, (i) at least 30 days but not more than the day occurring 60 days and one year prior to the Termination Date, a six-month extension of the Termination Date with respect to the Commitments then outstanding and (ii) thereafter, an additional six-month extension provided at least 30 days but not more than the day occurring 60 days and one year prior to the Termination Date (as extended pursuant to clause (i) of this sentence) (each, an Extension Request ). The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of such Extension Request and the Termination Date in effect at such time shall, effective as of the applicable Extension Date (as defined below), be extended for an additional six-month period, provided that, on such Extension Date (a) the Administrative Agent shall have received payment in full of the extension fee set forth in Section 2.08(d) and (b) the following statements shall be true and the Administrative Agent shall have received for the benefit of each Lender Party a certificate signed by a duly authorized officer of the Operating Partnership, dated the applicable Extension Date, stating that: (i) the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.01 are true and correct in all material respects (unless qualified as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect, in which case such representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all respects) on and as of such Extension Date (except to the extent that such representations and warranties relate solely to an earlier date (in which case such representations and warranties shall have been true and accurate in all material respects or all respects, as applicable, on and as of such earlier date)), and (ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing or would result from such extension. Extension Date means, in the case of each extension option, the first date after the delivery by the Borrowers of the related Extension Request that the conditions set forth in clauses (a) and (b) above are satisfied. In the event that an extension is effected pursuant to this Section 2.16, the aggregate principal amount of all Advances shall be repaid in full ratably to the Lenders on the Termination Date as so extended. As of the Extension Date, any and all references in this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to the Termination Date shall refer to the Termination Date as so extended.

 (b) Maintaining the L/C Account Collateral . So long as any Advance or any other Obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall remain unpaid, any Letter of Credit shall be outstanding, any Guaranteed Hedge Agreement shall be in effect or any Lender Party shall have any Commitment:

 (c) Investing of Amounts in the L/C Cash Collateral Account . The Administrative Agent will, from time to time invest (i)(A) amounts received with respect to the L/C Cash Collateral Account in such Cash Equivalents credited to the L/C Cash Collateral Account as the Borrowers may select and the Administrative Agent, as collateral agent, may approve in its reasonable discretion, and (B) interest paid on the Cash Equivalents referred to in clause (i)(A) above, and (ii) reinvest other proceeds of any such Cash Equivalents that may mature or be sold, in each case in such Cash Equivalents credited in the same manner.

In addition, the Administrative Agent shall have the right at any time to exchange such Cash 

Equivalents for similar Cash Equivalents of smaller or larger determinations, or for other Cash Equivalents, credited to the L/C Cash Collateral Account. 
 (d) Release of Amounts . So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Administrative Agent will pay and release to any Borrower or at its order or, at the request of any Borrower, to the Administrative Agent to be applied to the Obligations of such Borrower under the Loan Documents such amount, if any, as is then on deposit in the L/C Cash Collateral Account.

of Default has occurred and is continuing, and (c) neither such reallocation nor any payment by a Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant thereto will constitute a waiver or release of any claim the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender Party may have against such Defaulting Lender or cause such Defaulting Lender to be a Non-Defaulting Lender; 
 (ii) to the extent that any portion of the Defaulting Lender s Facility Exposure with respect to any Letter of Credit Facility cannot be so reallocated, whether by reason of the first proviso in clause (i) above or otherwise, the Borrowers will, not later than three Business Days after demand by the Administrative Agent make arrangements satisfactory to the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion to protect the Administrative Agent and the other Lender Parties against the risk of non-payment by such Defaulting Lender; and

For purposes of the foregoing, (A) each of the Sustainability Margin Adjustment and the Sustainability Facility Fee Adjustment shall be determined as of the fifth (5th) Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent of a Pricing Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 5.03(c) based upon the Certified Capacity set forth in such Pricing Certificate and the calculations of the Sustainability Margin Adjustment and the Sustainability Facility Fee Adjustment calculations, as applicable, therein (such Business Day, the Sustainability Pricing Adjustment Date and (B) each change in the Applicable Margin resulting from a Pricing Certificate shall be effective during the period commencing on and including the applicable Sustainability Pricing Adjustment Date and ending on the date immediately preceding the next Sustainability Pricing Adjustment Date (or, in the case of non-delivery of a Pricing Certificate or the 

delivery of an incomplete Pricing Certificate, the last day such Pricing Certificate could have been delivered pursuant to Section 5.03(c)). 
 (b) For the avoidance of doubt, only one Pricing Certificate may be delivered in respect of any Annual Period, and the Applicable Margin for the Advances and the Letter of Credit Fee will not be reduced or increased pursuant to this Section 2.23 by more than 4.0 basis points (such limit, the Maximum Margin Adjustment ), and the Applicable Margin for the Facility Fee will never be reduced or increased by more than 1.0 basis points, in each case pursuant to the Sustainability Margin Adjustment or the Sustainability Facility Fee Adjustment, as applicable, in respect of any Annual Period (such limit, the Maximum Facility Fee Adjustment ).

Each applicable adjustment shall only apply until the date on which the next adjustment is due to take place. 
 (c) If no such Pricing Certificate is delivered by the Operating Partnership (or any Pricing Certificate shall be incomplete) within the period set forth in Section 5.03(c), the Sustainability Margin Adjustment will be positive 4.0 basis points and the Sustainability Facility Fee Adjustment will be positive 1.0 basis points commencing on the last day such Pricing Certificate could have been delivered pursuant to the terms of Section 5.03(c) and continuing until the Operating Partnership delivers a complete Pricing Certificate to the Administrative Agent. 
 (d) If (i)(A) any of the Operating Partnership or the Required Lenders become aware of any material inaccuracy in the Sustainability Margin Adjustment, the Sustainability Facility Fee Adjustment or the Certified Capacity as reported on the applicable Pricing Certificate as certified by the KPI Metric Auditor (a Pricing Certificate Inaccuracy and not later than ten (10) Business Days after obtaining knowledge thereof, the Required Lenders or the Operating Partnership, as applicable, deliver a written notice to the Administrative Agent describing such Pricing Certificate Inaccuracy in reasonable detail including, to the extent applicable, calculations supporting such material inaccuracy (who shall furnish a copy to each of the Lenders and the Operating Partnership) or (B) the Operating Partnership and the Required Lenders agree that there was a Pricing Certificate Inaccuracy at the time of delivery of the relevant Pricing Certificate, (ii) the KPI Metric Auditor confirms in writing that there was in fact a Pricing Certificate Inaccuracy and (iii) a proper calculation of the Sustainability Margin Adjustment, the Sustainability Facility Fee Adjustment or the Certified Capacity would have resulted in an increase in the Applicable Margin for the Advances and the Letter of Credit Fee, and the Applicable Margin for the Facility Fee for such period, then the Operating Partnership shall be obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent for the ratable account of the Lenders, promptly on demand by the Administrative Agent (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to the Operating Partnership under any Bankruptcy Law, automatically and without further action by the Administrative Agent or any Lender), but in no event more than ten (10) Business Days after the Operating Partnership has received written notice of, or has agreed in writing that there was, a Pricing Certificate Inaccuracy, an amount equal to: the excess of (x) the amount of interest and fees that would have been payable for such period at the rate giving effect to the proper Sustainability Facility Fee Adjustment or Sustainability Margin Adjustment, as applicable over (y) the amount of interest and fees actually paid for such period (the True-Up Amount ). If the Operating Partnership becomes aware of any Pricing Certificate Inaccuracy and, in connection therewith, if a proper calculation of the Sustainability Margin Adjustment, the Sustainability Facility Fee Adjustment or the Certified Capacity would have resulted in a decrease in the Applicable Margin for the Advances and the Letter of Credit Fee, and the Applicable Margin for the Facility Fee for such period, then, upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of notice from the Operating Partnership of such Pricing Certificate Inaccuracy (which notice shall include corrections to the calculations of the Sustainability Margin Adjustment the Sustainability Facility Fee Adjustment or the Certified Capacity, as applicable), commencing on the Business Day following receipt by the

 (d) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of any Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document, the agreements and obligations of the Borrowers and the other Loan Parties contained in Sections 2.10 and 2.12, Section 7.06 and this Section 9.04 shall survive the payment in full of principal, interest and all other amounts payable hereunder and under any of the other Loan Documents. 
 (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 9.04, for so long as a TMK is prohibited under the TMK Law from guaranteeing or being liable for the obligations of any other Person, a TMK that is a Borrower shall be liable only for obligations under this Section 9.04 with respect to itself and not any other Loan Party. 
 (f) No Indemnified Party referred to in Section 9.04(b) shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed by it through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, except to the extent such damages are found in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from (x) such Indemnified Party s gross negligence or willful misconduct or the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Party s officers, directors, employees or agents, (y) a breach in bad faith of such Indemnified Party s obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document or (z) a claim not involving an act or omission of any Loan Party or any of its respective Subsidiaries and that is brought by an Indemnified Party against another Indemnified Party (other than against an Arranger, a Co-Sustainability Structuring Agent or the Administrative Agent in their capacities as such). 
 SECTION 9.05. Right of Set-off . Upon (a) the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default and (b) the making of the request or the granting of the consent specified by Section 6.01 to authorize the Administrative Agent to declare the Advances or the Notes due and payable pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.01, the Administrative Agent and each Lender Party and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and otherwise apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by the Administrative Agent, such Lender Party or such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any Borrower or any other Loan Party against any and all of the Obligations of such Borrower or such Loan Party now or hereafter existing under the Loan Documents, irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent or such Lender Party shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such obligations may be unmatured. The Administrative Agent and each Lender Party agrees promptly to notify the Borrowers or such Loan Party after any such set-off and application; provided , 

however , that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights of the Administrative Agent and each Lender Party and their respective Affiliates under this Section 9.05 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of set-off) that the Administrative Agent, such Lender Party and their respective Affiliates may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Defaulting Lender exercises any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off will be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.21(a) and, pending such payment, will be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks, the Swing Line Banks and the Lenders and (y) the Defaulting Lender will provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff.

 SECTION 9.07. Assignments and Participations; Replacement Notes (aa) Each Lender may (and, if demanded by the Borrowers in accordance with Section 2.10(g) or 9.01(b) will) assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment or Commitments, the Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it); provided , however , that (i) each such assignment shall be of a uniform, and not a varying, percentage of all rights and obligations under and in respect of one or more of the Tranches (and any assignment of a Commitment or an Advance must be made to an Eligible Assignee that is capable of lending in the Committed Foreign Currencies related to such Commitment and Advance), (ii) except in the case of an assignment to a Person that, immediately prior to such assignment, was a Lender, an Affiliate of any Lender or a Fund Affiliate of any Lender or an assignment of all of a Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement, the aggregate amount of the Commitments being assigned to such Eligible Assignee pursuant to such assignment (determined as of the Transfer Date) shall in no event be less than the Commitment Minimum under each Tranche or an integral multiple in excess thereof of 1,000,000 in the case of the U.S. Dollar Revolving Credit Tranche, 1,000,000 in the case of the Multicurrency Revolving Credit Tranche, A 1,000,000 in the case of the Australian Dollar Revolving Credit Tranche, S 1,000,000 in the case of the Singapore Dollar Revolving Credit Tranche, IDR10,000,000,000 in the case of the IDR Revolving Credit Tranche, KRW1,000,000,000 in the case of the KRW-A Revolving Credit Tranche and the KRW-B Revolving Credit Tranche and the Equivalent of 1,000,000 in the case of any Supplemental Tranche (or, in each case, such lesser amount as shall be approved by the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of effectiveness of such assignment, the Operating Partnership), (iii) each such assignment shall be to an Eligible Assignee, (iv) no such assignments shall be permitted until the Administrative Agent shall have notified the Lender Parties that syndication of the Commitments hereunder has been completed, without the consent of the Administrative Agent, (v) each such assignment made as a result of a demand by the Borrowers pursuant to Section 2.10(g) or 9.01(b) shall be an assignment of all rights and obligations of the assigning Lender under this Agreement and (vi) the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the Register, an Assignment and Acceptance, together with any Note or Notes subject to such assignment and, except if such assignment is being made by a Lender to an Affiliate or Fund Affiliate of such Lender, the Processing Fee; provided , however , that for each such assignment made as a result of a demand by the Borrowers pursuant to Section 2.10(g) or 9.01(b), the Borrowers shall pay or cause to be paid to the Administrative Agent the Processing Fee; provided further that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole 

discretion, elect to waive the Processing Fee in the case of any assignment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such assignment will be made by any Lender to any Defaulting Lender or Potential Defaulting Lender or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this sentence and no assignment, transfer, sub-participation or subcontracting in relation to a drawing under this Agreement by a French Borrower may be effected to a Lender incorporated, domiciled, established or acting through a lending office situated in a Non-Cooperative Jurisdiction. In the same way, no Lender having made an Advance under this Agreement to a French Borrower shall change its lending office for a lending office situated in a Non-Cooperative Jurisdiction. In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment will be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Advances previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank, each Swing Line Bank and each other Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon), and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Advances and participants in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Advances in accordance with its Pro Rata Share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder becomes effective under applicable law without compliance with the provisions of this Section 9.07(a), then the assignee of such interest will be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs. (a) Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording in the Register, from and after the later of such Transfer Date or recording, (i) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, hereunder and (ii) the Lender or Issuing Bank assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights (other than its rights under Sections 2.10, 2.12, 7.06, 8.05 and 9.04 to the extent any claim thereunder relates to an event arising prior to such assignment) and be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the remaining portion of an assigning Lender s or Issuing Bank s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender or Issuing Bank shall cease to be a party hereto).

Assignee; (vi) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion under the Loan Documents as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations that by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be. 
 (c) The Administrative Agent on behalf of the Borrowers shall maintain at its address referred to in Section 9.02 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lender Parties and, with respect to Lender Parties, the Commitment under each Tranche of, and principal amount of (and stated interest on) the Advances owing under each Tranche to, each Lender Party from time to time (the Register ). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender Party hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent or any Lender Party at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. 
 (d) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender Party and an assignee, together with any Note or Notes subject to such assignment, the Administrative Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance has been completed and is in substantially the form of Exhibit D hereto, (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrowers. In the case of any assignment by a Lender, within five Business Days after its receipt of such notice, the applicable Borrower, at its own expense, shall, if requested by the applicable Lender, execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent in exchange for the surrendered Note or Notes a new Note payable to such Eligible Assignee in an amount equal to the portion of the outstanding Advances purchased by it under each Tranche and any unfunded Commitment assumed by it under each Tranche pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance and, if any assigning Lender has retained any portion of the outstanding Advances under a Tranche or any unfunded Commitment under a Tranche, a new Note payable to such assigning Lender in an amount equal to the portion of such Advances and such unfunded Commitments retained by it hereunder. Such new Note or Notes, if any, shall be in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of such surrendered Note or Notes, shall be dated the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance and shall otherwise be in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto. 
 (e) Each Issuing Bank may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under the undrawn portion of its Letter of Credit Commitment at any time; provided , however , that (i) except in the case of an assignment to a Person that immediately prior to such assignment was an Issuing Bank or an assignment of all of an Issuing Bank s rights and obligations under this Agreement, the amount of the Letter of Credit Commitment of the assigning Issuing Bank being assigned pursuant to each such assignment (determined as of the date of the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment) shall in no event be less than the Minimum Letter of Credit Commitment and shall be in an integral multiple in excess thereof of 1,000,000 in the case of the U.S. Dollar Letter of Credit Facility, 1,000,000 in the case of the Multicurrency Letter of Credit Facility, A 1,000,000 in the case of the Australian Letter of Credit Facility, IDR10,000,000,000 in the case of the IDR Letter of Credit Facility, KRW1,000,000,000 in the case of the KRW-A Letter of Credit Facility and the KRW-B Letter of Credit Facility, and S 1,000,000 in the case of the Singapore Letter of Credit Facility, (ii) each such assignment shall be to an Eligible Assignee and (iii) the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the Register, an Assignment and Acceptance, together with the Processing Fee, provided that such fee shall not be payable if the assigning Issuing Bank is making such assignment simultaneously with the assignment in its capacity as a Lender of all or a portion of its Revolving Credit Commitment to the same Eligible Assignee. 

(f) The assignee may, with respect to an assignment of rights by a Lender under this Agreement with respect to any French Borrower, if it considers it necessary to make such assignment effective as against any third party, arrange for the Assignment and Acceptance to be notified to such French Borrower by a bailiff huissier in accordance with article 1690 of the French Civil Code. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the non-compliance by the assignee with the provisions of this paragraph (g) affect the validity of transfer of rights and obligations or the validity of the assignment of rights as the case may be. 
 (g) Each Lender Party may sell participations to one or more Persons (other than any natural person or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of, a natural person, or Loan Party or any of its Affiliates) in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitments, the Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes (if any) held by it) without the consent of the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, any Co-Sustainability Structuring Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Swing Line Bank; provided , however , that (i) such Lender Party s obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, its Commitments) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender Party shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) such Lender Party shall remain the holder of any such Note for all purposes of this Agreement, (iv) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Co-Sustainability Structuring Agents and the other Lender Parties shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender Party in connection with such Lender Party s rights and obligations under this Agreement, (v) no participant under any such participation shall have any right to approve any amendment or waiver of any provision of any Loan Document, or any consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom, except that any agreement with respect to such participation may provide that such participant shall have a right to approve such amendment, waiver or consent to the extent that such amendment, waiver or consent would reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Advances or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such participation, or postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Advances or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such participation, and (vi) if, at the time of such sale, such Lender Party was entitled to payments under Section 2.12(a) or (e) in respect of withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term Indemnified Taxes shall include (in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future as a result of a change in law or other amounts otherwise includable in Indemnified Taxes) withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to such participant on such date, provided that such participant complies with the requirements of Section 2.12(g) as if it were a Lender, such participant agrees to be subject to the provisions of Section 2.10(g) as if it were an assignee under this Section 9.07, and such participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.12 (a) or (e) than such Lender Party would have been entitled to receive. Each Lender Party that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each participant and the principal amounts of (and stated interest on) each participant s interest in the Advances or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register provided that no Lender Party shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any participant or any information relating to a participant s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender Party shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 
 (h) Any Lender Party may, in connection with any assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section 9.07, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant any information relating to any Borrower furnished to such Lender Party by or on behalf of any Borrower; provided , however , that, prior to any such disclosure, the assignee or participant or proposed 

assignee or participant shall agree to preserve the confidentiality of any Confidential Information received by it from such Lender Party in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.12. 
 (i) In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment will be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Advances previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks, the Swing Line Banks and each other Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon), and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Advances relating to the applicable Tranche and participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Advances in accordance with its Applicable Pro Rata Share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder becomes effective under applicable law without compliance with the provisions of this Section 9.07(j), then the assignee of such interest will be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs. 
 (j) (i) If a Lender changes its name it shall, at its own costs and within seven (7) Business Days from the date of the name change, provide and deliver to the Administrative Agent an original or certified true copy of a legal opinion issued by the legal advisers to such Lender in the jurisdiction where such Lender is incorporated, addressed to the Administrative Agent (in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent): (A) identifying the Lender which has changed its name, its new name, the date from which the change has taken effect; and (B) confirming that the Lender s obligations under the Loan Documents remain legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations even after the change of name.

 (l) Upon notice to the applicable Borrower from the Administrative Agent or any Lender of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any Lender s Note, such Borrower will execute and deliver, in lieu of such original Note, a replacement promissory note, identical in form and substance to, and dated as of the same 

date as, the Note so lost, stolen or mutilated, subject to delivery by such Lender to such Borrower of an affidavit of lost note and indemnity in customary form.

Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement or any other Loan Document by email (with the executed counterpart of the signature pages attached to the email in .pdf format or similar format) shall be effective as delivery of an original executed counterpart of this Agreement or such other Loan Document, as applicable. Copies of originals, including copies delivered by .pdf or other electronic means, shall have the same import and effect as original counterparts and shall be valid, enforceable and binding for the purposes of this Agreement and each other Loan Document. The words execution, signed, signature, and words of like import in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.

Lender Party including such applicable laws of the State of New York and the United States of America from time to time in effect.

In the event that the Obligations of the Borrowers under the Loan Documents are accelerated by reason of any Event of Default under this Agreement or otherwise, or in the event of any required or permitted prepayment, then such consideration that constitutes interest may never include more than the Maximum Rate and excess interest, if any, provided for in this Agreement or otherwise shall be canceled automatically as of the date of such acceleration or prepayment and, if theretofore paid, shall be credited on the principal of the Obligations of the applicable Borrowers under the Loan Documents (or, if such Obligations shall have been paid in full, refunded to such Borrowers). In determining whether or not the interest paid or payable under any specific contingencies exceeds the Maximum Rate, the Borrowers and the Lender Parties shall to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law amortize, prorate, allocate and spread in equal parts during the period of the full stated term of the Facility all amounts considered to be interest under applicable law at any time contracted for, taken, charged, received, reserved or paid in connection with the Obligations of the Loan Parties under the Loan Documents.

 SECTION 9.16. Judgment Currency . (cc) If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in one currency into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the first currency with such

 (a) Each provision of this Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as the Administrative Agent (in consultation with the Borrowers) may from time to time specify to be appropriate to reflect the adoption of the Euro by any member state of the European Union and any relevant market conventions or practices relating to the Euro. 
 SECTION 9.18. No Fiduciary Duties .

the Lender Parties acting in various capacities under the Loan Documents or for other customers of the Administrative Agent, any Arranger or any Lender Party as described in this Section 9.18.

Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.

If and to the extent such Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each such Lender Party shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender Party together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender Party until the date such Lender Party repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the cost of funds incurred by the Administrative Agent in respect of such amount.

Each Lender Party further agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. 
 (h) Any Lender Party claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.12 agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender Party, (x) be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender Party or (y) subject such Lender Party to any material unreimbursed cost or expense. 
 (i) If any Lender Party or the Administrative Agent receives a refund of Taxes or Other Taxes paid by any Borrower or for which the Borrowers have indemnified any Lender Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, pursuant to this Section 2.12, then such Lender Party or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall pay such amount, net of any reasonable expenses incurred by such Lender Party or the Administrative Agent, to the Borrowers as soon as practicable.

If the Operating Partnership becomes aware of any Pricing Certificate Inaccuracy and, in connection therewith, if a proper calculation of the Sustainability Margin Adjustment, the Sustainability Unused Fee Adjustment or the Certified Capacity would have resulted in a decrease in the Applicable Margin for the Advances and the Letter of Credit Fee, and the Applicable Margin for the Unused Fee for such period, then, upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of notice from the Operating Partnership of such Pricing Certificate Inaccuracy (which notice shall include corrections to the calculations of the Sustainability Margin Adjustment, the Sustainability Unused Fee Adjustment or the Certified Capacity, as applicable), commencing on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent of such notice, the

In the event the Operating Partnership fails to comply with the terms of this Section 2.23, the Lenders sole recourse with respect to such non-compliance shall be limited to the True-Up Amount.

 (f) Each Issuing Bank may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under the undrawn portion of its Letter of Credit Commitment at any time; provided , however , that (i) except in the case of an assignment to a Person that immediately prior to such

 (c) d) If, with respect to any Eurocurrency Rate Advances, the Tranche Required Lenders for any Tranche notify the Administrative Agent that the Eurocurrency Rate for any Interest Period for such Advances will not adequately reflect the cost to such Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their Eurocurrency Rate Advances for such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Lenders, whereupon (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make such Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be suspended and (y) with respect to any Eurocurrency Rate Advances that are then outstanding under any Tranche, such Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall thereafter bear interest at the Central Bank Rate plus the Applicable Margin, in each case until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower that such Lenders have determined that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist. 
 (d) e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation shall make it unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental authority shall assert that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make Eurocurrency Rate Advances or to fund or continue to fund or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Advances in Euros or if the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation shall make it unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental authority shall assert that it is unlawful for any Lender to purchase or sell or to take deposits of, Euros in the Relevant Interbank Market, then, on notice thereof and demand therefor by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (i) each Eurocurrency Rate Advance by such Lender will automatically, upon such demand, Convert into a Central Bank Rate Advance and (ii) the obligation of such Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower that such Lender has determined that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist; provided , however , that, before making any such demand, such Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Lending Office if the making of such a designation would allow such Lender or its Lending Office to continue to perform its obligations to make Eurocurrency Rate Advances or to continue to fund or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Advances and would not, in the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. The Conversion of any Eurocurrency Rate Advance of any Lender to a Central Bank Rate Advance or the suspension of any obligation of any Lender to make any Eurocurrency Rate Advance pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.10(e) shall not affect the obligation of any other Lender to continue to make Eurocurrency Rate Advances in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 
 (e) f) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.10 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s right to demand such compensation; provided , however , that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.10 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender, notifies the Operating Partnership of the event or circumstance giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the event or circumstance giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 

(f) g) If (i) any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, (ii) any Lender requests compensation pursuant to Section 2.10(a) or Section 2.10(b), (iii) any Lender gives notice pursuant to Section 2.10(d) or Section 2.10(e), or (iv) Borrower is required to pay Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any governmental authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.12 (any such Lender, an Affected Lender ), then the Operating Partnership shall have the right, upon written demand to such Affected Lender and the Administrative Agent at any time thereafter to cause such Affected Lender to assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, its Commitment or Commitments, the Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes, if any, held by it) to a Replacement Lender, provided that the proposed assignment does not conflict with applicable laws. The Replacement Lender shall purchase such interests of the Affected Lender at par and shall assume the rights and obligations of the Affected Lender under this Agreement upon execution by the Replacement Lender of an Assignment and Acceptance delivered pursuant to Section 9.07; provided , however , the Affected Lender shall be entitled to indemnification as otherwise provided in this Agreement with respect to any events occurring prior to such assignment. Any Lender that becomes an Affected Lender agrees that, upon receipt of notice from the Borrower given in accordance with this Section 2.10(g) it shall promptly execute and deliver an Assignment and Acceptance with a Replacement Lender as contemplated by this Section 2.10(g). The execution and delivery of any such Assignment and Acceptance shall not be deemed to comprise a waiver of claims against any Affected Lender by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent or a waiver of any claims against the Borrower or the Administrative Agent by the Affected Lender. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Lender shall not be required to make any assignment pursuant to this Section 2.10(g) if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Operating Partnership to require such assignment cease to apply. 
 SECTION 2.11. Payments and Computations (a) (a) The Borrower shall make each payment hereunder with respect to principal of, interest on, and other amounts relating to, Advances not later than 2:00 P.M.

Each payment shall be made by the Borrower in the currency of the applicable Advance to which the applicable payment relates, except to the extent required otherwise hereunder, and the Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to accept a payment that is not in the correct currency. The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause like funds to be distributed (i) if such payment by the Borrower is in respect of principal, interest, commitment fees or any other Obligation then payable hereunder and under the other Loan Documents to more than one Lender, to such Lenders for the account of their respective Lending Offices ratably in accordance with the amounts of such respective Obligations then payable to such Lenders in accordance with the applicable Standing Payment Instructions and (ii) if such payment by the Borrower is in respect of any Obligation then payable hereunder to one Lender, to such Lender for the account of its Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 9.07(d), from and after the applicable Transfer Date, the Administrative Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under any Notes issued in connection therewith in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder in accordance with such Lender assignee s Standing Payment Instructions, and the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves. In respect of any assignment pursuant to Section 9.07, the effective date of which, in each case, is not on the last day of an Interest Period (A) any interest or fees in respect of the relevant assigned interest in the Facility that are expressed to accrue by reference to the lapse of time shall continue to accrue in favor of the assignor Lender up to but excluding the Transfer Date (the Accrued Amounts and shall become due and payable to the assignor Lender without further interest accruing on them on the last day of the current Interest Period (or, if the Interest Period is longer than six calendar months, on the next of the 

dates which falls at six monthly intervals after the first day of that Interest Period) and (B) the rights assigned or transferred by the assignor Lender will not include the right to the Accrued Amounts so that, for the avoidance of doubt: (1) when the Accrued Amounts become payable, those Accrued Amounts will be payable for the account of the assignor Lender and (2) the amount payable to the assignee Lender on that date will be the amount which would, but for the application of this Section 2.11(a), have been payable to it on that date, but after deduction of the Accrued Amounts.

 (b) Reserved. 
 (c) All computations of interest based on the Eurocurrency Rate shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such fees or interest are payable. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. 
 (d) Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or commitment fee, as the case may be; provided , however , that if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurocurrency Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day. 
 (e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to any Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each such Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each such Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the cost of funds incurred by the Administrative Agent. 
 (f) To the extent that the Administrative Agent receives funds for application to the amounts owing by the Borrower under or in respect of this Agreement or any Note in currencies other than the currency or currencies required to enable the Administrative Agent to distribute funds to the Lenders in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.11, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to convert or exchange such funds into Dollars or into Euros or from Dollars to Euros or from Euros to Dollars, as the case may be, to the extent necessary to enable the Administrative Agent to distribute such funds in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.11, provided that the Borrower and each of the Lenders hereby agree that the Administrative Agent shall not be liable or responsible for any loss, cost or expense suffered by the Borrower or such Lender as a result of any conversion or exchange of currencies effected pursuant to this Section 2.11(f) or as a result of the failure of the Administrative Agent to effect any such conversion or exchange; provided further that the Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, and hold the Administrative Agent and each Lender harmless, for any and all losses, costs and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Lender for any conversion or exchange of currencies (or the failure to convert or exchange any currencies) in accordance with this Section 2.11(f) save to the extent that it is found in a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such loss, cost or expense resulted from (i) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent or 

such Lender or (ii) a material breach by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in bad faith of such party s obligations hereunder. 
 (g) Whenever any payment received by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents is insufficient to pay in full all amounts due and payable to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under or in respect of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on any date, such payment shall be distributed by the Administrative Agent and applied by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in the order of priority set forth below in this Section 2.11(g). Payments to the Lenders shall be in accordance with the applicable Standing Payment Instructions. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, Advances denominated in Euros will, at any time during the continuance of such Event of Default that the Administrative Agent determines it necessary or desirable to calculate the pro rata share of the Lenders on a Facility-wide basis, be converted on a notional basis into the Equivalent amount of Dollars solely for the purposes of making any allocations required under this Section 2.11(g) and Section 2.13(b). The order of priority shall be as follows:

(a) (a) If a change in any foreign currency occurs pursuant to any applicable law, rule or regulation of any governmental, monetary or multi-national authority, this Agreement (including, without limitation, the definition of Eurocurrency Rate) will be amended to the extent determined by the Administrative Agent (acting reasonably and in consultation with the Borrower) to be necessary to reflect the change in currency (and any relevant market conventions or practices relating to such change in currency) and to put the Lenders and the Borrower in the same position, so far as possible, that they would have been in if no change in such foreign currency had occurred. 
 (a) b) Each provision of this Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as the Administrative Agent (in consultation with the Borrower) may from time to time specify to be appropriate to reflect the adoption of the Euro by any member state of the European Union and any relevant market conventions or practices relating to the Euro. 
 SECTION 9.18. No Fiduciary Duties . Each Loan Party agrees that nothing in the Loan Documents or otherwise will be deemed to create an advisory, fiduciary or agency relationship or fiduciary or other implied duty between the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Affiliate thereof, on the one hand, and such Loan Party, its stockholders or its Affiliates, on the other. The Loan Parties agree that the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents (including the exercise of rights and remedies hereunder and thereunder) are arm s-length commercial transactions. Each Loan Party agrees that it has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate and that it is responsible for making its own independent judgment with respect to such transactions and the process leading thereto. Each of the Loan Parties acknowledges that the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and their respective Affiliates may have interests in, or may be providing or may in the future provide financial or other services to other parties with interests which a Loan Party may regard as conflicting with its interests and may possess information (whether or not material to the Loan Parties) other than as a result of (x) the Administrative Agent acting as administrative agent hereunder or (y) the Lenders acting as lenders hereunder, that the Administrative Agent or any such Lender may not be entitled to share with any Loan Party. Without prejudice to the foregoing, each of the Loan Parties agrees that the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and their respective Affiliates may (a) deal (whether for its own or its customers account) in, or advise on, securities of any Person, and (b) accept deposits from, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, accept investment banking engagements from and generally engage in any kind of business with other Persons in each case, as if the Administrative Agent were not the Administrative Agent and as if the Lenders were not Lenders, and without any duty to account therefor to the Loan Parties. Each of the Loan Parties hereby irrevocably waives, in favor of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Arrangers, any conflict of interest which may arise by virtue of the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and/or the Lenders acting in various capacities under the Loan Documents or for other customers of the Administrative Agent, any Arranger or any Lender as described in this Section 9.18. 
 SECTION 9.19. Reserved . 
 SECTION 9.20. Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of Affected Financial Institutions . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, 

arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any Affected Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the write-down and conversion powers of the applicable Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by: (a) the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the applicable Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any party hereto that is an Affected Financial Institution; and 
 (b) the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if applicable: 
 (i) a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability; 
 (ii) a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such Affected Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or 
 (iii) the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the write-down and conversion powers of the applicable Resolution Authority. 
 SECTION 9.21. Acknowledgement Regarding Any Supported QFCs . To the extent that the Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for Guaranteed Hedge Agreements or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, QFC Credit Support and each such QFC a Supported QFC ), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the U.S. Special Resolution Regimes in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States): In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support. 
 (b) As used in this Section 9.21, the following terms have the following meanings:

Notwithstanding anything else herein, if at any time any Successor Rate as so determined would otherwise be less than zero, the Successor Rate will be deemed to be zero for the purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. In connection with the implementation of a Successor Rate, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement; provided that, with respect to any such amendment so effected, the Administrative Agent shall post each such amendment implementing such Conforming Changes to the Borrower and the Lenders reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective.

 (h) Any Lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.12 agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, (x) be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender or (y) subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense.

(i) If any Lender or the Administrative Agent receives a refund of Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Borrower or for which the Borrower has indemnified any Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, pursuant to this Section 2.12, then such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall pay such amount, net of any reasonable expenses incurred by such Lender or the Administrative Agent, to the Borrower as soon as practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Borrower shall not be entitled to review the tax records or financial information of any Lender or the Administrative Agent and (ii) neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation to pursue (and no Loan Party shall have any right to assert) any refund of Taxes or Other Taxes that may be paid by the Borrower. 
 (j) Each party s obligations under this Section 2.12 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.

 (i) if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and
 (ii) the provisions of this Section 2.13 shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender) or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Advances to any assignee or participant, other than an assignment to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section 2.13 shall apply).
 Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Loan Party in the amount of such participation. SECTION 2.14. Use of Proceeds . The proceeds of the Advances shall be available (and the Borrower agrees that it shall use such proceeds) solely for the acquisition, development and redevelopment of Assets, for repayment of Debt, for working capital and for other general corporate purposes of the Parent Guarantor, the Borrower and their respective Subsidiaries. Borrower will not directly or knowingly indirectly use the proceeds of the Advances, or lend, contribute or otherwise make available to any Subsidiary, joint venture partner or other Person such extensions of credit or proceeds, (i) to fund any prohibited activities or businesses of or with any Person, or in any country or territory, that, at the time of such funding, is, or whose government 

is, the subject of Sanctions or (ii) in any other manner that would result in a violation of Sanctions by any Person (including any Person participating in the Facility, whether as underwriter, advisor, investor, or otherwise) or any Anti-Corruption Laws. SECTION 2.15. Evidence of Debt . (a)(a) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Advance owing to such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder. The Borrower agrees that upon notice by any Lender to the Borrower (with a copy of such notice to the Administrative Agent) to the effect that a promissory note or other evidence of indebtedness is required or appropriate in order for such Lender to evidence (whether for purposes of pledge, enforcement or otherwise) the Advances owing to, or to be made by, such Lender, the Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to such Lender, with a copy to the Administrative Agent, a Note, in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto, payable to such Lender in a principal amount equal to the Commitment of such Lender. All references to Notes in the Loan Documents shall mean Notes, if any, to the extent issued hereunder. In the event and to the extent that the provisions of any Note shall conflict with this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall govern.
 (b) The Register maintained by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 9.07(d) may include a control account and a subsidiary account for each Lender. In each account with respect to each Lender (including the control account and subsidiary account, if applicable) there shall be recorded (i) the date and amount of each Borrowing made hereunder, the Type of Advances comprising such Borrowing, and, if appropriate, the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the terms of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it, (iii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder, and (iv) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent from the Borrower hereunder and each Lender s share thereof. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the Register, the Register shall control in the absence of manifest error. 
 (c) Entries made in good faith by the Administrative Agent in the Register pursuant to subsection (b) above, and by each Lender in its account or accounts pursuant to subsection (a) above, shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to, in the case of the Register, each Lender and, in the case of such account or accounts, such Lender, under this Agreement, absent manifest error; provided , however , that the failure of the Administrative Agent or such Lender to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the Register or such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. It is the intention of the parties hereto that the Advances will be treated as in registered form within the meaning of Sections 163(f), 871(h)(2) and 881(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code (and any other relevant or successor provisions of the Internal Revenue Code).

The Borrower may request, by written notice to the Administrative Agent, at least 30 days prior, but not earlier than the day occurring 60 days and one year prior to the Initial Maturity Date, a twelve-month extension of the Initial Maturity Date (an Extension Request ). The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of such Extension Request and the Initial Maturity Date shall, effective as of the applicable Extension Date (as defined below), be extended for an additional twelve-month period, provided that, on such Extension Date (a) the Administrative Agent shall have received payment in full of the extension fee set forth in Section 2.08(d) and (b) the following statements shall be true and the Administrative Agent shall have received for the account of each Lender a certificate signed by a duly authorized officer of the Operating Partnership, dated the applicable Extension Date, stating that: (i) the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.01 are true and correct in all material respects (unless qualified as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect, in which case such representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all respects) on and as of such Extension Date (except to the extent that such representations and warranties relate solely to an earlier date (in which case such representations and warranties shall have been true and accurate in all material respects or all respects, as applicable, on and as of such earlier date)), and (ii) no 

Default has occurred and is continuing or would result from such extension. Extension Date means the first date after the delivery by the Borrower of the related Extension Request that the conditions set forth in clauses (a) and (b) above are satisfied.

 SECTION 2.19. Reserved. 
 SECTION 2.20. Reserved . 
 SECTION 2.21. Defaulting Lenders . (a)(a) If a Lender becomes, and during the period it remains, a Defaulting Lender, then any amount paid by the Borrower or otherwise received by the Administrative Agent for the account of a Defaulting Lender under this Agreement (whether on account of principal, interest, fees, indemnity payments or other amounts) will not be paid or distributed to such Defaulting Lender, but will instead be retained by the Administrative Agent in a segregated non-interest bearing account until the termination of the Commitments and payment in full of all Obligations and will be applied by the Administrative Agent, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to the making of payments from time to time in the following order of priority: first to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent under this Agreement; second to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Non-Defaulting Lenders under this Agreement, ratably among them in accordance with the amounts then due and payable to them; third , as the Operating Partnership may request to the funding of any Advance in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent, provided that no Default or Event of Default then exists; fourth , if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Operating Partnership, to be held in a non-interest bearing deposit account and released in order to satisfy obligations of such Defaulting Lender to fund Advances under this Agreement; fifth , so long as no Default or Event of Default then exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by such against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and sixth , after the termination of the Commitments and payment in full of all Obligations, to pay amounts owing under this Agreement to such Defaulting Lender or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent may apply any such amount in accordance with Section 2.11. (b)(b) If the Borrower and the Administrative Agent agree in writing in their discretion that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein, such Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par such portion of outstanding Advances of the other Lenders and/or make such other adjustments as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Pro Rata Share of the Lenders to be on a pro rata basis in accordance with their respective Commitments whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender and will be a Non-Defaulting Lender (and such Pro Rata Share of each Lender will automatically be adjusted on a prospective basis to reflect the foregoing), provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while such Lender was a Defaulting Lender; provided further that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Non-Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from such Lender s having been a Defaulting Lender.

It is the intent of the Borrower and each Lender in the execution and performance of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to contract in strict compliance with applicable usury laws, including conflicts of law concepts, governing the Advances of each Lender 

including such applicable laws of the State of New York and the United States of America from time to time in effect. In furtherance thereof, the Lenders and the Borrower stipulate and agree that none of the terms and provisions contained in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall ever be construed to create a contract to pay, as consideration for the use forbearance or detention of money, interest at a rate in excess of the Maximum Rate and that for purposes hereof interest shall include the aggregate of all charges which constitute interest under such laws that are contracted for, taken, charged, received, reserved or paid under this Agreement; and in the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, under any circumstances the aggregate amounts contracted for, taken, charged, received, reserved or paid on the Advances, include amounts which, by applicable law, are deemed interest which would exceed the Maximum Rate, then such excess shall be deemed to be a mistake and, each Lender receiving the same shall credit the same on the principal of the Obligations of the Borrower under the Loan Documents (or if such Obligations shall have been paid in full, refund said excess to the Borrower). In the event that the Obligations of the Borrower under the Loan Documents are accelerated by reason of any Event of Default under this Agreement or otherwise, or in the event of any required or permitted prepayment, then such consideration that constitutes interest may never include more than the Maximum Rate and excess interest, if any, provided for in this Agreement or otherwise shall be canceled automatically as of the date of such acceleration or prepayment and, if theretofore paid, shall be credited on the principal of the Obligations of the Borrower under the Loan Documents (or, if such Obligations shall have been paid in full, refunded to the Borrower).
