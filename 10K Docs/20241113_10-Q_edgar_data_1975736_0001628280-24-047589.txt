As a result, the Adviser will not earn this incentive fee for any quarter until the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for such quarter exceeds the hurdle rate of . Once the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income in any quarter exceeds the hurdle rate, the Adviser will be entitled to a catch-up fee equal to the amount of the pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the hurdle rate, until the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for such quarter equals , or annually, of net assets.

 Discretionary Share Repurchase Program 
 Beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company has commenced a share repurchase program in which it intends, subject to market conditions and the discretion of the Company s Board of Trustees, or the Board, to offer to repurchase, in each quarter, up to of the Common Shares outstanding (either by number of shares or aggregate net asset value, or NAV) as of the close of the previous calendar quarter. The Board may amend or suspend the share repurchase program if in its reasonable judgment it deems such action to be in the Company s best interest and the best interest of the Company s shareholders. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter, such as when a repurchase offer would place an undue burden on the Company s liquidity, adversely affect its operations or risk having an adverse impact on the Company that would outweigh the benefit of the repurchase offer. The Company intends to conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and the 1940 Act. All shares purchased by the Company pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares.

The Company redeemed all of the issued and outstanding Series A Preferred Shares on August 1, 2024, or the Preferred Shares Redemption Date, at a price equal to per share, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to and including the Preferred Shares Redemption Date and a redemption premium per share. From and after the close of business on the Preferred Shares Redemption Date, all dividends on the Series A Preferred Shares ceased to accrue, such shares are no longer deemed to be outstanding, and all rights of the holders of such shares ceased. 
 Prior to the redemption of the Series A Preferred Shares, each holder of Series A Preferred Shares was entitled to a liquidation preference of per share, or the Liquidation Value, plus additional amounts as set forth in the Supplement to the Company s Second Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust Relating to Series A Cumulative Preferred Shares. In addition, with respect to distributions, including the payment of dividends and distribution of the Company s assets upon dissolution, liquidation, or winding up, the Series A Preferred Shares were senior to all other classes and series of Common Shares, and ranked on parity with any other class or series of Preferred Shares, whether such class or series was existing or was created in the future, to the extent of the aggregate Liquidation Value and all accrued but unpaid dividends and any applicable redemption premium on the Series A Preferred Shares. 
 Prior to redemption, dividends on each Series A Preferred Share accrued on a daily basis at the rate of per annum of the sum of the Liquidation Value thereof plus all accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, from and including March 29, 2024, to and including the earlier of (1) the date of any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company or (2) the date on which such Series A Preferred Share were redeemed.

The annual Distribution/Servicing Fees are paid by the Company to the Placement Agents pursuant to the Company s amended and restated distribution and servicing plan, or the Distribution and Servicing Plan. 
 The distribution and servicing expenses borne by the participating brokers may be different from and substantially less than the amount of Distribution/Servicing Fees charged. The Distribution/Servicing Fees will be payable to the Placement Agents, but the Placement Agents anticipate that all or a portion of the Distribution/Servicing Fees will be retained by, or re-allowed (paid) to, eligible participating brokers and servicing broker-dealers for ongoing services performed by such broker-dealers. The Company may pay for expenses related to its distribution out of its own assets under the Distribution and Servicing Plan outside of the Distribution/Servicing Fees, including but not limited to, expenses associated with advertising, compensation of underwriters, dealers, and sales personnel, the printing and mailing of prospectuses to other than current shareholders, and the printing and mailing of sales literature, each as may be determined to be in the best interests of the Company. 
 All or a portion of the Distribution/Servicing Fees may be used to pay for sub-transfer agency, sub-accounting and certain other administrative services that are not required to be paid pursuant to the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees under applicable FINRA rules; however, the Company also may pay for these sub-transfer agency, sub-accounting and certain other administrative services outside of the Distribution/Servicing Fees and its Distribution and Servicing Plan. The total amount that will be paid over time for other underwriting compensation depends on the average length of time for which shares remain outstanding, the term over which such amount is measured and the performance of the Company s investments. The Company will also pay or reimburse certain organizational and offering expenses, including, subject to FINRA limitations on underwriting compensation, certain wholesaling expenses. 
 The Board, including a majority of the members of the Board who are not interested persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Company, or the Independent Trustees, have reviewed and approved the Placement Agent Agreements in accordance with Section 15(c) of the 1940 Act, and will annually review the Placement Agent Agreements and Distribution/Servicing Fees to determine that

 Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement

Any Expense Payment that the Adviser has committed to pay must be paid by the Adviser to the Company in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds no later than days after such commitment was made in writing, and/or offset against amounts due from us to the Adviser or its affiliates.

Any payments required to be made by the Company are referred to as a Reimbursement Payment. Available Operating Funds means the sum of (i) the Company s net investment income (excluding organizational and offering costs and extraordinary expenses, taxes (including excise tax) and accrued capital gains incentive fees on unrealized appreciation) and (ii) the Company s net capital gains.

 Subject to applicable legal restrictions and the sole discretion of the Company s Board, the Company intends to declare and pay regular cash distributions on a monthly basis. From time to time, the Company may also declare and pay special interim distributions in the form of cash or shares of its Common Shares at the discretion of the Company s Board. These distributions have been or will be paid monthly to shareholders of record as of monthly record dates previously determined by the Company s Board. Shareholders receive the distribution payments in cash or in Common Shares in accordance with their election under the Company s distribution reinvestment plan. The timing and amount of any future distributions to shareholders are subject to applicable legal restrictions and the sole discretion of the Company s Board. 
 The Company may fund its cash distributions to shareholders from any sources of funds legally available to it, including proceeds from the sale of Common Shares in the Private Offering, borrowings, net investment income from operations, capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, non-capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, and dividends or other distributions paid to the Company on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies. The Company has not established limits on the amount of funds it may use from available sources to make distributions. During certain periods, the Company s distributions may exceed its earnings. As a result, it is possible that a portion of the distributions the Company makes may represent a return of capital. A return of capital generally is a return of a shareholder s investment rather than a return of earnings or gains derived from the Company s investment activities. Each year a statement on Form 1099-DIV identifying the sources of the distributions (i.e., paid from ordinary income, paid from net capital gains on the sale of securities, and/or a return of capital, which is a nontaxable distribution) will be mailed to the Company s shareholders. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to pay distributions at a specific rate or at all.

 Foreign Currency Forward Contracts 
 The Company may enter into foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to facilitate settlement of purchases and sales of investments denominated in foreign currencies and to economically hedge the impact that an adverse change in foreign exchange rates would have on the value of the Company s investments denominated in foreign currencies. A foreign currency forward contract is a commitment to purchase or sell a foreign currency at a future date at a negotiated forward rate. These contracts are marked-to-market by recognizing the difference between the contract forward exchange rate and the forward market exchange rate on the last day of the period presented as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. Realized gains or losses are recognized when forward contracts are settled. Risks arise as a result of the potential inability of the counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The Company attempts to limit counterparty risk by only dealing with well-known counterparties.

 Note 8. Fair Value of Financial Instruments (continued) 

 Level 2 Significant other observable inputs Level 3 Significant unobservable inputs 
 In addition, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts, as described in Note 7, which were categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as of September 30, 2024. 
 The Board is responsible for overseeing the valuation of the Company s portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to the Adviser s valuation policy. The Board has designated the Adviser as the Company s valuation designee, with day-to-day responsibility for implementing the portfolio valuation process set forth in the Adviser s valuation policy. 
 The Company s investments will consist primarily of debt investments that were acquired directly from the issuer. Debt investments, for which broker quotes are not available, are valued by independent valuation firms, which determine the fair value of such investments by considering, among other factors, the borrower s ability to adequately service its debt, prevailing interest rates for like investments, expected cash flows, call features, anticipated repayments and other relevant terms of the investments. Except as described below, all of the Company s equity/other investments are also valued by independent valuation firms, which determine the fair value of such investments by considering, among other factors, contractual rights ascribed to such investments, as well as various income scenarios and multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, cash flows, net income, revenues or, in limited instances, book value or liquidation value. An investment that is newly issued and purchased near the date of the financial statements is valued at cost if the Adviser determines that the cost of such investment is the best indication of its fair value. Such investments described above are typically classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. Investments that are traded on an active public market are valued at their closing price as of the date of the financial statements and are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. Except as described above, the Adviser typically values the Company s other investments by using the midpoint of the prevailing bid and ask prices from dealers on the date of the relevant period end, which are provided by independent third-party pricing services and screened for validity by such services and are typically classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. 
 The Adviser periodically benchmarks the bid and ask prices it receives from the third-party pricing services and/or dealers and independent valuation firms, as applicable, against the actual prices at which the Company purchases and sells its investments. Based on the results of the benchmark analysis and the experience of the Company s management in purchasing and selling these investments, the Adviser believes that these prices are reliable indicators of fair value. As of September 30, 2024 , t he Adviser reviewed and approved the valuation determinations made with respect to these investments in a manner consistent with the Adviser s valuation policy.

The Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility also requires mandatory prepayment of interest and principal upon certain events, including asset sales, extraordinary receipts, returns of capital, equity issuances, and incurrence of indebtedness, with certain exceptions and minimum amount thresholds. 
 Borrowings under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility are subject to compliance with a borrowing base test. Amounts drawn under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility in U.S. dollars will bear interest at either term SOFR plus , or the prime rate plus . The Company may elect either the term SOFR or prime rate at the time of drawdown, and loans denominated in U.S. dollars may be converted from one rate to another at any time at the Company s option, subject to certain conditions. Amounts drawn under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility in other permitted currencies will bear interest at the relevant rate specified therein plus .

As of September 30, 2024, of these purchases are included in payable for investments purchased in the statement of assets and liabilities. For the period from October 1, 2024 through November 8, 2024, the Company purchased investments, including unfunded commitments, with a cost of from the Financing Provider. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the conditions precedent to the Company s obligation to purchase any additional investments from the Financing Provider had not been met. The Company did not hold any beneficial interest in the warehouse. 
 The Company enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnification provisions. The Company s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown; however, the Company has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts. The Adviser has reviewed the Company s existing contracts and expects the risk of loss to the Company to be remote. 
 The Company is not currently subject to any material legal proceedings and, to the Company s knowledge, no material legal proceedings are threatened against the Company. From time to time, the Company may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of the Company s rights under contracts with its portfolio companies. While the outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not expect that any such proceedings will have a material effect upon its financial condition or results of operations. 
 Unfunded commitments to provide funds to portfolio companies are not recorded in the Company s statement of assets and liabilities. Since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company has sufficient liquidity to fund these commitments.

 Overview 
 We are an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. Formed as a Delaware statutory trust on April 19, 2023, we are externally managed by the Adviser, which manages our day-to-day operations and provides us with investment advisory and administrative services pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement. The Adviser is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC. We also intend to elect to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intend to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. We commenced operations concurrent with the initial closing on the Seed Contribution on February 27, 2024. 
 The Adviser oversees (subject to the oversight of the Board, a majority of whom are not interested persons, as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act) the management of our operations and is responsible for making investment decisions with respect to our portfolio pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement. Under the Advisory Agreement, we have agreed to pay the Adviser an annual management fee as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance. 
 We are conducting the continuous Private Offering of our Common Shares in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, including the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D promulgated thereunder, Regulation S under the Securities Act and other exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. 
 Investments 
 Our investment objectives are to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. We seek to meet our investment objectives by: 
 utilizing the experience and expertise of the management team of the Adviser; 
 employing a defensive investment approach focused on long-term credit performance and principal protection; 
 focusing primarily on debt investments in a broad array of private U.S. companies, including middle-market companies, which we define as companies with annual EBITDA of 50 million to 150 million at the time of investment; 
 investing primarily in established, stable enterprises with positive cash flows; and 
 maintaining rigorous portfolio monitoring in an attempt to anticipate and pre-empt negative credit events within our portfolio, such as an event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of a portfolio company. 
 We pursue our investment objective by investing primarily in the debt of private middle market U.S. companies with a focus on originated transactions sourced through the network of the Adviser and its affiliates. We define direct originations as any investment where our investment adviser or its affiliates had negotiated the terms of the transaction beyond just the price, which, for example, may include negotiating financial covenants, maturity dates or interest rate terms. These directly originated transactions include participation in other originated transactions where there may be third parties involved, or a bank acting as an intermediary, for a closely held club, or similar transactions. 
 Once we have invested a substantial amount of proceeds from the Private Offering, under normal circumstances and after we ramp up our portfolio, we expect that we will invest at least 60 of our total assets (net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes) in first lien, senior secured loans of private middle-market U.S. companies. We expect to also invest up to 30 of our total assets (net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes) in certain private asset-based finance investments, which derive returns from recurring, often contractual cash flows of large, diversified pools of underlying hard and financial assets, or ABF Investments, and, to a lesser extent, in subordinated loans of private U.S. companies. We expect downside protection to come in the form of investments backed by collateral and contractual rights negotiated with counterparties. Our ABF Investment strategy will focus on directly originated, private ABF Investments with a multi-sector investment approach that seeks the most attractive relative value and risk-adjusted returns (a measure of the excess return per unit of risk in an investment strategy) from investments across a range of sectors, such as Consumer/Mortgage Finance (e.g., auto loans), Contractual Cash Flows (e.g., royalties), Hard Assets (e.g., aircraft 
 30 

Table of Contents 

 leasing) and Small-Medium Enterprises (e.g., real estate development lending), as well as instrument types, such as senior loans and junior capital. 
 A majority of our ABF Investments is expected to be directly originated and proprietary, including through newly formed and/or existing lending and servicing platform businesses established by KKR Credit to access specific lending or servicing market opportunities that are otherwise difficult to access. In addition, a large majority of our ABF Investments is expected to be illiquid and otherwise not actively traded on an established market. We generally expect that the majority of our ABF Investments will not be eligible portfolio companies under the 1940 Act and, to the extent that such investments are not considered to be eligible portfolio companies, we will not treat the applicable ABF Investments as qualifying assets for purposes of Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act. 
 Although we do not expect a significant portion of our portfolio to be comprised of subordinated loans, there is no limit on the amount of such loans in which we may invest. We may purchase interests in loans or make other debt investments, including investments in senior secured bonds, through secondary market transactions in the over-the-counter market or directly from our target companies as primary market or directly originated investments. In connection with our debt investments, we may on occasion receive equity interests such as warrants or options as additional consideration. We may also purchase or otherwise acquire interests in the form of common or preferred equity or equity-related securities, such as rights and warrants that may be converted into or exchanged for common stock or other equity or the cash value of common stock or other equity, including through a co-investment with a financial sponsor or possibly the restructuring of an investment. In addition, a portion of our portfolio may be comprised of corporate bonds, structured products, other debt securities and derivatives, including total return swaps and credit default swaps. 
 The Adviser will seek to tailor our investment focus as market conditions evolve. Depending on market conditions, we may increase or decrease our exposure to less senior portions of the capital structures of our portfolio companies or otherwise make opportunistic investments, such as where the market price of loans, bonds or other securities reflects a lower value than deemed warranted by the Adviser s fundamental analysis. Such investment opportunities may occur due to general dislocations in the markets, a misunderstanding by the market of a particular company or an industry being out of favor with the broader investment community and may include event driven investments, anchor orders and structured products. 
 To a lesser extent, we may also invest in syndicated loans, which will generally be liquid, and may be used for the purposes of maintaining liquidity for our discretionary share repurchase program and cash management, while also presenting an opportunity for attractive investment returns. 
 Most of our investments will be in private U.S. companies, but (subject to compliance with BDCs requirement to invest at least 70 of its assets in private U.S. companies), we also expect to invest to some extent in European and other non-U.S. companies, but we do not expect to invest in emerging markets. We may invest in companies of any size or capitalization. Subject to the limitations of the 1940 Act, we may invest in loans or other securities, the proceeds of which may refinance or otherwise repay debt or securities of companies whose debt was originated and directly negotiated by the Adviser or KKR Credit, with our co-investment affiliates. From time to time, we may co-invest in certain privately negotiated investment transactions, including investments originated and directly negotiated by the Adviser or KKR Credit, with our co-investment affiliates. 
 The first lien, senior secured loans and senior secured bonds in which we expect to invest generally have stated terms of three to seven years, and the subordinated debt investments that we expect to make (to a lesser extent) generally have stated terms of up to ten years, but the expected average life of such securities is generally three to four years. However, we may invest in loans and securities with any maturity or duration. Our debt investments may be rated by a NRSRO and, in such case, generally will carry a rating below investment grade (rated lower than Baa3 by Moody s or lower than BBB- by S P), which are often referred to as junk. We may invest without limit in debt or other securities of any rating, as well as debt or other securities that have not been rated by a NRSRO. 
 Revenues 
 The principal measure of our financial performance is net change in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income, net realized gain or loss on investments, net realized gain or loss on foreign currency, net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments and net unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency. Net investment income is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees and other investment income and our operating and other expenses. Net realized gain or loss on investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their amortized cost, including the respective realized gain or loss on foreign currency for those foreign-denominated investment transactions. Net realized gain or loss on foreign currency is the portion of realized gain or loss attributable to foreign currency fluctuations. Net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio, including the respective unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency for those foreign-denominated investments. Net unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency is the net change in the value of receivables or accruals due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. 
 We principally generate revenues in the form of interest income on the debt investments and ABF Investments we hold, as well as dividends and other distributions on the equity or other securities we hold. In addition, we generate revenues in the form of non- 
 31 

Table of Contents 

 recurring commitment, closing, origination, structuring or diligence fees, monitoring fees, fees for providing managerial assistance, consulting fees, prepayment fees and performance-based fees. 
 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of management and incentive fees and other expenses under the Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement, interest expense from financing arrangements and other indebtedness, and other expenses necessary for our operations. The management and incentive fees compensate the Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, executing, monitoring and servicing our investments. 
 The Adviser oversees our day-to-day operations, including the provision of general ledger accounting, fund accounting, legal services, investor relations, certain government and regulatory affairs activities, and other administrative services. The Adviser also performs, or oversees the performance of, our corporate operations and required administrative services, which includes being responsible for the financial records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports for our shareholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, the Adviser assists us in calculating our NAV, overseeing the preparation and filing of tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our shareholders, and generally overseeing the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. 
 Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, we reimburse the Adviser for expenses necessary to perform services related to our administration and operations, including the Adviser s allocable portion of the compensation and related expenses of certain personnel of FS Investments and KKR Credit providing administrative services to us on behalf of the Adviser. We reimburse the Adviser no less than monthly for all costs and expenses incurred by the Adviser in performing its obligations and providing personnel and facilities under the Administration Agreement. The Adviser allocates the cost of such services to us based on factors such as total assets, revenues, time allocations and/or other reasonable metrics. The Board reviews the methodology employed in determining how the expenses are allocated to us and the proposed allocation of administrative expenses among us and certain affiliates of the Adviser. The Board then assesses the reasonableness of such reimbursements for expenses allocated to us based on the breadth, depth and quality of such services as compared to the estimated cost to us of obtaining similar services from third-party service providers known to be available. In addition, the Board considers whether any single third-party service provider would be capable of providing all such services at comparable cost and quality. Finally, the Board compares the total amount paid to the Adviser for such services as a percentage of our net assets to the same ratio as reported by other comparable BDCs. 
 Except as provided in the Administration Agreement and the Advisory Agreement, we bear all expenses of our operations and transactions, including all other expenses incurred by the Adviser in performing services for us and administrative personnel paid by the Adviser, subject to the limitations included in the Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement. See Note 4 to our unaudited financial statements included herein for more information regarding the expenses borne by us and, thus, our shareholders. 
 In addition, we have contracted with State Street Bank and Trust Company to provide various accounting and administrative services, including, but not limited to, preparing preliminary financial information for review by the Adviser, preparing and monitoring expense budgets, maintaining accounting and corporate books and records, processing trade information provided by us and performing testing with respect to RIC compliance. We pay State Street Bank and Trust Company directly for the costs of such services. 
 The Adviser has agreed to advance all of our organizational and offering expenses on our behalf (including legal, accounting, printing, mailing, subscription processing and filing fees and expenses and other offering expenses, including costs associated with technology integration between our systems and those of our participating brokers, reasonable bona fide due diligence expenses of participating brokers supported by detailed and itemized invoices, costs in connection with preparing sales materials and other marketing expenses, design and website expenses, fees and expenses of our transfer agent, fees to attend retail seminars sponsored by participating brokers and costs, expenses and reimbursements for travel (provided that we shall not be required to bear the cost of private airfare in excess of comparable first-class/business rates on a commercial airline, if available), meals, accommodations, entertainment and other similar expenses related to meetings or events with prospective investors, brokers, registered investment advisors or financial or other advisors, but excluding the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee) through a date determined by the Adviser in its discretion. We had no obligation to reimburse the Adviser for such advanced expenses until the initial issuance of Common Shares to non-affiliated investors after commencement of the monthly closings for the Private Offering, which commenced on March 28, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had incurred organizational and offering expenses of 760 and 1,380, respectively, which expenses the Adviser elected to cover pursuant to the Expense Support Agreement, subject to reimbursement by the Company pursuant to its terms. See Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement below for more information. In no event will we bear in excess of 1.5 million in organizational expenses; the Adviser has agreed to be responsible for any organizational expenses in excess of 1.5 million. 
 From time to time, the Adviser or its affiliates may pay third-party providers of goods or services. We will reimburse the Adviser or such affiliates thereof for any such amounts paid on our behalf. From time to time, the Adviser may defer or waive fees and/or rights to be reimbursed for expenses. All of the foregoing expenses will ultimately be borne by our shareholders.

 Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement 
 The Company has entered into an Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement, or the Expense Support Agreement, with the Adviser. The Adviser may elect to pay certain of our expenses on the Company s behalf, including, but not limited to, organizational and offering expenses and any of the Company s expenses related to investor relations, outside legal counsel and other outside advisors and experts, finance, operations and administration, each, an Expense Payment, provided that no portion of the payment will be used to pay any interest expense or distribution and/or shareholder servicing fees of the Company. Any Expense Payment that the Adviser has committed to pay must be paid by the Adviser to the Company in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds no later than 90 days after such commitment was made in writing, and/or offset against amounts due from us to the Adviser or its affiliates. 
 Following any calendar month in which Available Operating Funds (as defined below) exceed the cumulative distributions accrued to the Company s shareholders based on distributions declared with respect to record dates occurring in such calendar month (the amount of such excess referred to as Excess Operating Funds), the Company will pay such Excess Operating Funds, or a portion thereof, to the Adviser until such time as all Expense Payments made by the Adviser to the Company within three years prior to the last business day of such calendar month have been reimbursed. Any payments required to be made by the Company are referred to as a Reimbursement Payment. Available Operating Funds means the sum of (i) the Company s net investment income (excluding organizational and offering costs and extraordinary expenses, taxes (including excise tax) and accrued capital gains incentive fees on unrealized appreciation) and (ii) the Company s net capital gains. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the period ended December 31, 2023 , the Adviser has agreed to pay 1,009 and 0, respectively, in Expense Payments, subject to reimbursement by the Company in accordance with the Expense Support Agreement. 

Fees and Expenses 
 The following table illustrates the aggregate fees and expenses that the Company expects to incur and that shareholders can expect to bear, either directly or indirectly, during the following twelve months. 
 Shareholder transaction expenses (fees paid directly from shareholder investment) Maximum sales load imposed on purchases (1) 
 3.00 Annual operating expenses (as a percentage of average net assets attributable to shares) (2) 
 Base management fee (3) 
 1.25 Incentive fees payable under our investment advisory agreement (4) 
 Interest payments on borrowed funds (5) 
 3.88 Distribution fee (6) 
 0.85 Organizational and offering costs (7) 
 0.24 Other expenses (8) 
 0.61 Total annual expenses 6.83 Waiver of management and subordinated income incentive fees (3) 
 (0.63) Net annual expenses 6.20 
 _______________ 
 (1) If Class S shares are purchased through certain financial intermediaries, they may directly charge transaction or other fees, including upfront placement fees or brokerage commissions, in such amount as they may determine. Class S shares will be subject to a maximum sales load of up to 3.0 of the offering price, or may forgo a sales load in favor of a brokerage commission imposed by a selling agent. Certain participating broker-dealers in the Private Offering may offer Class S shares subject to a placement agent fee of 0.50 of the offering price, and up to 1.5 , provided that the sum of the sales load and placement agent fee will not exceed 3.5 of the offering price. 
 (2) Amount assumes that we sell 740.7 million worth of Class S shares during the following twelve months and that we receive proceeds from such sales of approximately 718.5 million, resulting in estimated average net assets of 619.7 million based on current asset levels. That amount also assumes that we borrow funds of approximately 60 of our average net assets during such period. Actual expenses will depend on the number of Class S shares we sell in the Private Offering and the amount of leverage we employ, if any. There can be no assurance that we will sell 740.7 million worth of Class S shares during the following twelve months. 
 (3) The Management Fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of 1.25 of our average monthly net assets during such period. The Adviser has agreed to waive the management and subordinated income incentive fees through March 31, 2025. 
 33 

Table of Contents 

 (4) Based on our current business plan, we anticipate that we may have capital gains and interest income that could result in the payment of an incentive fee to the Adviser in the following twelve months. However, the incentive fee payable to the Adviser is based on our performance and will not be paid unless we achieve certain performance targets. As we cannot predict whether we will meet the necessary performance targets, we have assumed that no incentive fee will be paid for purposes of this table. We expect the incentive fees we pay to increase to the extent we earn greater interest income through our investments in portfolio companies, and realize capital gains upon the sale of investments in our portfolio companies. 
 (5) We may borrow funds to make investments, including before we have fully invested the initial proceeds of the Private Offering. To the extent that we determine it is appropriate to borrow funds to make investments, the costs associated with such borrowing will be indirectly borne by our shareholders. The figure in the table assumes we borrow for investment purposes an amount of approximately 60 of our average net assets (including such borrowed funds) during such period and that the annual interest rate on the amount borrowed is 6.5 . 
 Our ability to incur leverage during the following twelve months depends, in large part, on the amount of money we are able to raise through the sale of Class S shares in the Private Offering and capital markets conditions. 
 (6) Percentage reflects an annual shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee of 0.85 per annum of the NAV, as of the beginning of the first calendar day of the applicable month, of the Class S shares. The distribution fee will accrue daily and be paid monthly beginning on the first day of the applicable month. 
 (7) Amount reflects estimated organizational and offering costs to be paid by us of up to approximately 1.5 million if we raise 740.7 million in gross proceeds. The Adviser has agreed to advance all of our organizational and offering expenses on our behalf through a date determined by the Adviser in its discretion. We will reimburse the Adviser for any such amounts paid on our behalf pursuant to the terms of the Expense Support Agreement. See Expenses and Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement sections above for more information. 
 (8) Other expenses primarily include accounting, legal and auditing fees, as well as the reimbursement of the compensation of administrative personnel and fees payable to our directors who do not also serve in an executive officer capacity for us or the Adviser. The amount presented in the table reflects estimated amounts we expect to pay during the following twelve months and does not include preferred pricing arrangements we may receive from certain parties as a newly formed entity. 
 Example 
 The following example demonstrates the projected dollar amount of total expenses that would be incurred over various periods with respect to a 10,000 investment assuming our direct and indirect annual operating expenses would remain at the percentage levels set forth in the table above (assuming we borrow an amount of approximately 60 of our average net assets) and Class S shares earn a 5.0 annual return:

Portfolio Asset Quality 
 In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, the Adviser uses an investment rating system to characterize and monitor the expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. The Adviser uses an investment rating scale of 1 to 4. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating: 
 Investment Rating 
 Summary Description 1 Performing investment generally executing in accordance with plan and there are no concerns about the portfolio company s performance or ability to meet covenant requirements. 2 Performing investment no concern about repayment of both interest and our cost basis but company s recent performance or trends in the industry require closer monitoring. 3 Underperforming investment some loss of interest or dividend possible, but still expecting a positive return on investment. 4 Underperforming investment concerns about the recoverability of principal or interest.

 The amount of the portfolio in each grading category may vary substantially from period to period resulting primarily from changes in the composition of the portfolio as a result of new investment, repayment and exit activities. In addition, changes in the grade of investments may be made to reflect our expectation of performance and changes in investment values.

 (1) Such revenues represent 5,939 and 8,767 of cash income earned as well as 248 and 259 in non-cash portions relating to accretion of discount and PIK interest for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Cash flows related to such non-cash revenues may not occur for a number of reporting periods or years after such revenues are recognized. 
 The level of interest income we receive is generally related to the balance of income-producing investments, multiplied by the weighted average yield of our investments. We expect the dollar amount of interest and any dividend income that we earn to increase as the size of our investments portfolio increases.

 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 We intend to generate cash primarily from the net proceeds from the Private Offering and from cash flows from interest and fees earned from our investments and principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. We may also fund a portion of our investments through borrowings from banks and issuances of senior securities, including before we have fully invested the proceeds of the Private Offering. Our primary use of cash will be investments in portfolio companies, payments of our expenses, including management fees, incentive fees and interest expenses, payment of cash distributions to our shareholders and repurchases of our Common Shares under our discretionary share repurchase program. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had received capital commitments of 60,000 from investors in the Private Offering, and have called an aggregate of 60,000 in capital contributions in exchange for 2,393,528 in Class S shares in connection with such commitments. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 28,695 in cash and foreign currency, which we held in custodial accounts, and 50,000 in borrowings available under our financing arrangements, subject to borrowing base and other limitations. As of September 30, 2024, we had unfunded debt investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of 57,572 and unfunded equity/other commitments of 16,113. We maintain sufficient cash on hand, available borrowings and liquid securities to fund such unfunded commitments should the need arise. 
 We intend to utilize leverage to finance our investments. The amount of leverage that we employ will be subject to the restrictions of the 1940 Act and the supervision of the Board. At the time of any proposed borrowing, the amount of leverage we employ will also depend on our Adviser s assessment of market and other factors. We have established credit facilities and other financing arrangements, and intend to establish one or more additional credit facilities or enter into other financing arrangements to facilitate investments and the timely payment of our expenses. 
 Asset Coverage 
 Under the provisions of the 1940 Act, following approval from our initial shareholders of the reduced asset coverage requirements under Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act on February 21, 2024, which approval became effective on February 22, 2024, we are currently permitted to issue senior securities only in amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 150 after each issuance of senior securities. For purposes of the 1940 Act, asset coverage means the ratio of (1) the total assets of a BDC, less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, to (2) the aggregate amount of senior securities representing indebtedness (plus, in the case of senior securities represented by preferred stock, the aggregate involuntary liquidation preference of such BDC s preferred stock). Under the 1940 Act, any Preferred Shares we issue will constitute a senior security for purposes of the 150 asset coverage test. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we will be required to make provisions to prohibit any dividend distribution to our shareholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the dividend distribution or repurchase. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate amount outstanding of the senior securities issued by us was 0. As of September 30, 2024, our asset coverage ratio as calculated under the 1940 Act was 100 . 
 Prior to investing in securities of portfolio companies, we invest the cash received from fees, interest and dividends earned from our investments and principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments primarily in cash, cash equivalents, including

 money market funds, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt instruments maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, consistent with our BDC election and our election to be taxed as a RIC.

 RIC Status and Distributions 
 We intend to elect to be subject to tax as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In order to qualify for RIC tax treatment, we must, among other things, make distributions of an amount at least equal to 90 of our investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for distributions paid, each tax year. As long as the distributions are declared by the later of the fifteenth day of the tenth month following the close of a tax year or the due date of the tax return for such tax year, including extensions, distributions paid up to twelve months after the current tax year can be carried back to the prior tax year for determining the distributions paid in such tax year. We intend to make sufficient distributions to our shareholders to qualify for and maintain our RIC tax status each tax year. We are also subject to a 4 nondeductible federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we make distributions in a timely manner to our shareholders generally of an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98 of our net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (2) 98.2 of our capital gain net income, which is the excess of capital gains in excess of capital losses, or capital gain net income (adjusted for certain ordinary losses), for the one-year period ending October 31 of that calendar year and (3) any net ordinary income and capital gain net income for the preceding years that were not distributed during such years and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax. Any distribution declar ed by us during October, November or December of any calendar year, payable to shareholders of record on a specified date in such a month and actually paid during January of the following calendar year, will be treated as if it had been paid by us, as well as received by our shareholders, on December 31 of the calendar year in which the distribution was declared. We can offer no assurance that we will achieve results that will permit us to pay any cash distributions. 
 Subject to applicable legal restrictions, and to the extent that we have taxable income available, we intend to make distributions to holders of our Common Shares. We intend to make monthly distributions to holders of our Common Shares and such distributions are recorded on the record date. All such distributions will be paid at the discretion of the Board and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, maintenance of our tax treatment as a RIC, compliance with applicable BDC regulations and such other factors as the Board may deem relevant from time to time. 
 The IRS currently requires that a RIC has two or more classes of stock allocate to each such class proportionate amounts of each type of its income (such as ordinary income and capital gains) based upon the percentage of total dividends paid to each class for the tax year. Accordingly, while our Preferred Shares were outstanding, we allocated capital gain dividends, if any, between our Common Shares and Preferred Shares in proportion to the total dividends paid to each class with respect to such tax year. 
 Prior to the redemption of all of our issued and outstanding Series A Preferred Shares on August 1, 2024, we paid dividends and distributions to our preferred shareholders semi-annually on or before June 30 and December 31 of each year. 
 During certain periods, our distributions may exceed our earnings. As a result, it is possible that a portion of the distributions we make may represent a return of capital. A return of capital generally is a return of a shareholder s investment rather than a return of earnings or gains derived from our investment activities. Each year a statement on Form 1099-DIV identifying the sources of the distributions will be mailed to our shareholders. No portion of the distributions paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 represented a return of capital. 
 We intend to make our regular distributions in the form of cash, out of assets legally available for distribution, except for those shareholders who have elected to receive their distributions in the form of additional Common Shares under our distribution reinvestment plan. Any distributions reinvested under the plan will nevertheless remain taxable to a U.S. shareholder.

The final number of Common Shares issued as of November 1, 2024 in connection with the monthly closing will be determined at a later date in connection with the Company s determination of its net asset value per Common Share as of October 31, 2024. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management utilizes available information, including our past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming the estimates and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We describe our most significant accounting policies in Note 2 to our unaudited financial statements included herein. 
 Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments required by our policies on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary based on changing conditions. We have identified one of our accounting policies, valuation of portfolio investments, specifically the valuation of Level 3 investments, as critical because it involves significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters, and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our reported results of operations or financial condition. As we execute our operating plans, we will describe additional critical accounting policies in the notes to our future financial statements in addition to those discussed below and in the notes to our unaudited financial statements included herein. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our investment portfolio, valued at fair value in accordance with our Board-approved valuation policy, represented 89.46 of our total assets.

 Valuation of Portfolio Investments and Determination of NAV 
 Valuation of Portfolio Investments 
 The Board is responsible for overseeing the valuation of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to the Adviser s valuation policy. As permitted by Rule 2a-5 of the 1940 Act, the Board has designated the Adviser as our valuation designee with day-to-day responsibility for implementing the portfolio valuation process set forth in the Adviser s valuation policy. 
 Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure , or ASC Topic 820, issued by the FASB clarifies the definition of fair value and requires companies to expand their disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 also establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical securities; Level 2, which includes inputs such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets and quoted prices for identical securities where there is little or no activity in the market; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. 
 The Adviser determines the fair value of our investment portfolio on at least a quarterly basis. Securities that are publicly-traded with readily available market prices will be valued at the reported closing price on the valuation date. Securities that are not publicly-traded with readily available market prices will be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser, in accordance with valuation policies approved by the Board. In connection with that determination, the Adviser will prepare portfolio company valuations which are based on relevant inputs, including, but not limited to, indicative dealer quotes, values of like securities, recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts, and valuations prepared by independent third-party pricing and valuation services. 
 With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, we undertake a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below: 
 our quarterly fair valuation process begins by the Adviser facilitating the delivery of updated quarterly financial and other information relating to each investment to an independent third-party pricing or valuation service; 
 the independent third-party pricing or valuation service then reviews and analyzes the information, along with relevant market and economic data, and determines proposed valuations for each portfolio company or investment according to the valuation methodologies in the Adviser s valuation policy and communicates the information to the Adviser in the form of a valuation range for Level 3 assets; 
 the Adviser then reviews the preliminary valuation information for each portfolio company or investment and provides feedback about the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of the valuation-related inputs considered by the independent third-party pricing or valuation service and any suggested revisions thereto prior to the independent third-party pricing or valuation service finalizing its valuation range; 
 the Adviser then provides the Board s valuation committee with its valuation determinations and valuation-related information for each portfolio company or investment, along with any applicable supporting materials; and other information that is relevant to the fair valuation process as required by the Adviser s Board-reporting obligations; 
 the Board s valuation committee meets with the Adviser to receive the relevant quarterly reporting from the Adviser and to discuss any questions from the valuation committee in connection with the valuation committee s role in overseeing the fair valuation process; and 
 following the completion of its fair value oversight activities, the valuation committee (with the assistance of the Adviser) provides the Board with a report regarding the quarterly valuation process. 
 In circumstances where the Adviser deems appropriate, the Adviser s internal valuation team values certain investments. When performing the internal valuations, the Adviser utilizes similar valuation techniques as an independent third-party pricing service would use. Such valuations are approved by an internal valuation committee of the Adviser, with oversight from the valuation committee of the Board, as described above. 
 Determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our financial statements refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations and any change in such valuations on our financial statements. In making its determination of fair value, the Adviser may use any independent third-party pricing or valuation services for which it has performed the appropriate level of due diligence. However, the Adviser is not required to determine fair value in accordance with the valuation provided by any single source, and may use any relevant data, including information sourced by the Adviser or provided by any independent third-party valuation or pricing service that the Adviser deems to be reliable in determining fair value under the 
 42 

Table of Contents 

 circumstances. Below is a description of factors that the Adviser and any independent third-party valuation services may consider when determining the fair value of our investments. 
 The valuation methods utilized for each portfolio company may vary depending on industry and company-specific considerations. Typically, the first step is to make an assessment as to the enterprise value of the portfolio company s business in order to establish whether the portfolio company s enterprise value is greater than the amount of its debt as of the valuation date. This analysis helps to determine a risk profile for the applicable portfolio company and its related investments, and the appropriate valuation methodology to utilize as part of the security valuation analysis. The enterprise valuation may be determined using a market or income approach. 
 Valuation of fixed income investments, such as loans and debt securities, depends upon a number of factors, including prevailing interest rates for like securities, expected volatility in future interest rates, call features, put features and other relevant terms of the debt. For investments without readily available market prices, the Adviser may incorporate these factors into discounted cash flow models to arrive at fair value. Various methods may be used to determine the appropriate discount rate in a discounted cash flow model. 
 Domestic and foreign fixed-income instruments and non-exchange traded derivatives are normally valued on the basis of quotes obtained from brokers and dealers or pricing services using data reflecting the earlier closing of the principal markets for those securities. Bank loans, including senior secured floating rate and fixed-rate loans, are valued by using readily available market quotations or another commercially reasonable method selected by an independent, third-party pricing service that has been engaged by the Adviser, or, if such independent, third-party valuations are not available, by using broker quotations. Senior secured adjustable, variable or floating rate loans for which an active secondary market exists to a reliable degree will be valued at the bid price in the market for such loans, as provided by a loan pricing service. Directly originated loans are valued on an individual loan level. In doing so, the Adviser may engage an independent, third-party valuation agent, and fair valuation of such loans will be performed using inputs that incorporate borrower level data, including significant events affecting the issuer or collateral and market developments. Prices obtained from independent pricing services use information provided by market makers or estimates of market values obtained from yield data relating to investments or securities with similar characteristics. Exchange traded options, futures and options on futures are valued at the settlement price determined by the relevant exchange. The value of swaps, including credit default swaps, total return swaps and interest rate swaps will be determined by obtaining at least one dealer quotation (including information from counterparties) or valuations from third-party pricing services. If no quotations or valuations are available, or if such quotations or valuations are believed to be unreliable, swaps will be fair valued pursuant to procedures adopted by the Adviser and overseen by the Board. 
 Other factors that may be considered include the borrower s ability to adequately service its debt, the fair market value of the borrower in relation to the face amount of its outstanding debt and the quality of collateral securing the debt investments. 
 For convertible debt securities, fair value generally approximates the fair value of the debt plus the fair value of an option to purchase the underlying security (i.e., the security into which the debt may convert) at the conversion price. To value such an option, a standard option pricing model may be used. 
 Our equity interests in portfolio companies for which there is no liquid public market are valued at fair value. Generally, the value of our equity interests in public companies for which market quotations are readily available is based upon the most recent closing public market price. Portfolio securities that carry certain restrictions on sale are typically valued at a discount from the public market value of the security. The Adviser will normally use pricing data for domestic or foreign equity securities received shortly after the close of the primary securities exchange on which such securities trade and does not normally take into account trading, clearances or settlements that take place after the close of the exchange. 
 When we receive warrants or other equity securities at nominal or no additional cost in connection with an investment in a debt security, the cost basis in the investment will be allocated between the debt securities and any such warrants or other equity securities received at the time of origination. The Adviser subsequently values these warrants or other equity securities received at their fair value. 
 See Note 8 to our unaudited financial statements included herein for additional information regarding the fair value of our financial instruments. 
 Determination of NAV 
 We expect to determine our NAV for the Common Shares each month as of the last day of each calendar month, and in no event less frequently than quarterly. The NAV per share for our Common Shares is determined by dividing the value of total assets attributable to the Common Shares minus liabilities attributable to the Common Shares by the total number of Common Shares outstanding at the date as of which the determination is made. We will use the valuation procedures set forth above in order to determine our NAV, as applied by the Adviser as our valuation designee under Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act. Fair value pricing may require subjective determinations about the value of a security. If events materially affecting the price of foreign portfolio securities occur between the time when their price was last determined on such foreign securities exchange or market and the time when our 
 43 

Table of Contents 

 NAV was last calculated (for example, movements in certain U.S. securities indices which demonstrate strong correlation to movements in certain foreign securities markets), such securities may be valued at their fair value as determined in good faith in accordance with procedures established by the Adviser and overseen by the Board. 
 For purposes of calculating NAV, all assets and liabilities initially expressed in foreign currencies will be converted into U.S. dollars at prevailing exchange rates as may be determined in good faith by the Adviser under the supervision of the Board. Although the Adviser s policy is intended to result in a calculation of our NAV that fairly reflects security values as of the time of pricing, we cannot ensure that fair values determined by the Adviser would accurately reflect the price that we could obtain for a security if it were to dispose of that security as of the time of pricing (for instance, in a forced or distressed sale). The prices used by the Adviser when determining fair value may differ from the value that would be realized if the securities were sold. 
 The NAV calculation is available generally within 20 business days after the end of the applicable month. Changes in our monthly NAV will reflect factors including, but not limited to, accruals for net portfolio income, interest expense and unrealized/realized gains (losses) on assets, any applicable organizational and offering costs and any expense reimbursements. When the Adviser determines NAV as of a day that is not the last day of a calendar quarter in connection with a drawdown on capital commitments or, for monthly closings to investors for immediate cash investment, as of the last day of a month that is not also the last day of a calendar quarter, we intend to update the value of securities with reliable market quotations to the most recent market quotation. For securities without reliable market quotations, the Adviser s valuation team will generally value such assets at the most recent quarterly valuation unless the Adviser determines that a significant observable change has occurred since the most recent quarter-end with respect to the investment (which determination may be as a result of a material event at a portfolio company, material change in market spreads, secondary market transaction in the securities of an investment or otherwise). If the Adviser determines such a change has occurred with respect to one or more investments, the Adviser will determine whether to update the value for each relevant investment using a range of values from an independent valuation firm, where applicable, in accordance with the Adviser s valuation policy, pursuant to authority designated by the Board. Additionally, the Adviser may otherwise determine to update the most recent quarter-end valuation of an investment without reliable market quotations that the Adviser considers to be material to the Company using a range of values from an independent valuation firm. 
 The most recently determined NAV per share for the Common Shares will be reported by the Company under cover of a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 We have entered into the Advisory Agreement and Administration Agreement with the Adviser to provide us with investment advisory and administrative services. Payments for investment advisory services under the Advisory Agreement are equal to (a) an annual base management fee based on the average monthly value of the Company s net assets during the most recently completed calendar quarter, and (b) an incentive fee based on our performance. The Adviser is reimbursed for administrative expenses incurred on our behalf. See Note 4 to our unaudited financial statements included herein for a discussion of these agreements and for the amount of fees and expenses accrued under these agreements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 If any of our contractual obligations are terminated, our costs may increase under any new agreements that we enter into as replacements. We would also likely incur expenses in locating alternative parties to provide the services we expect to receive under our Advisory Agreement and our Administration Agreement. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We may become a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of our business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2024 , we had off-balance sheet arrangements with the Financing Provider under the Cliffwater Facility Agreement, as described below. 
 Warehousing Transaction 
 On May 9, 2024, the Company entered into the Cliffwater Facility Agreement with Cliffwater and the Financing Provider, each an unaffiliated third party, to acquire portfolio investments from time to time by purchasing all or a portion of certain investments owned and held by the Financing Provider at the Company s or the Financing Provider s request pursuant to the terms and provisions of the Cliffwater Facility Agreement. The Cliffwater Facility Agreement creates a forward obligation of the Financing Provider to sell, and a forward obligation of the Company or its designee to purchase, all or a portion of certain investments owned and held by the Financing Provider at the Company s or Cliffwater s request pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Cliffwater Facility Agreement. Prior to the date on which (i) an insolvency proceeding is commenced by the Company or (ii) an insolvency proceeding is commenced against the Company and is not dismissed or stayed within 60 days, the Company s obligation to purchase such investments is conditional upon satisfying certain conditions, including the Capital Condition. The Company made customary representations and warranties in the Cliffwater Facility Agreement. 
 44 

Table of Contents 

 Subject to satisfaction of the Capital Condition, the Cliffwater Facility Agreement provides that, on or prior to the twenty-four month anniversary of March 29, 2024, or the Scheduled Facility End Date, Cliffwater can require the Company to purchase from the Financing Provider such investments entered into in connection with the Cliffwater Facility Agreement (x) with respect to such investment initially acquired by the Financing Provider prior to the date that the Company has raised investor subscriptions that are callable, have been called or received in an aggregate amount of at least 600,000, such date, the Subscription Threshold Date, in an amount up to 3.0 of the aggregate subscriptions that the Company has raised on or prior to the trade date of any purchase and (y) with respect to such investment initially acquired by the Financing Provider on or after the Subscription Threshold Date, in an amount up to 2.0 of the aggregate subscriptions that the Company has raised on or prior to the trade date of any purchase. Such purchases will be at the prices determined under the Cliffwater Facility Agreement, as discussed further below; provided that, (i) the Company may, on one occasion, extend the Scheduled Facility End Date by three months and (ii) if no notice requiring a purchase or sale, as applicable, of such investments is delivered in accordance with the Cliffwater Facility Agreement by the Scheduled Facility End Date, none of the parties to the Cliffwater Facility Agreement may require the other party to purchase or sell, as applicable, such investments after the Scheduled Facility End Date. 
 In connection with investments (other than Warehouse Asset Based Finance Investments (as defined below)): 
 (A) The Financing Provider will receive during the period commencing on the date the Financing Provider acquires an investment and ending on the date immediately preceding the trade date of such investment, the Holding Period, (i) all principal proceeds, all OID and Fees (as defined in the Facility Agreement) paid on account of any portion of an underlying purchased loan that is repaid or prepaid and not available to be reborrowed and an available unfunded commitment that has been terminated, not funded and is not available to be reborrowed by the underlying obligor and all amendment fees on such investments it holds pursuant to the Facility Agreement, in each case, during the Holding Period, (ii) all cash interest and payment-in-kind interest and all fees (other than one-time fees) that regularly accrue and are payable to all lenders under the underlying documents for such investments on account of such lenders loans or commitments outstanding pursuant to such underlying documents, in each case, during the Holding Period and (iii) additional consideration for any such investments transferred to the Purchaser that have paid OID and Fees prior to the trade date during the Holding Period equal to an amount from 0.25 to 1.50 (based on the length of time such asset is held by the Financing Provider) of the par value or unfunded amount, as applicable, of any such investment as of immediately prior to any transfer of such investment by the Financing Provider to the Company, the consideration under this clause (iii), the Additional Consideration. 
 (B) Following fulfillment of the conditions precedent to the Company s obligations to purchase any loans under the Facility Agreement, the Company will purchase such loans owned and held by the Financing Provider under the Facility Agreement at a purchase price equal to (i) the par amount of such loan plus, without duplication, (ii) PIK interest accrued during the Holding Period and PIK interest accrued but not capitalized prior to the Holding Period minus (iii) the sum of (x) OID, upfront fees and other similar fees on account of such purchase loan (all of which are attributable to the Holding Period) plus (y) any termination fees or other similar fees during the Holding Period plus (iv) solely to the extent that such loan has paid OID, upfront fees or other similar fees, the Additional Consideration. 
 (C) Similarly, following fulfillment of the conditions precedent to the Company s obligations to purchase any unfunded commitments under the Facility Agreement, the Company will purchase such assets owned and held by the Financing Provider under the Facility Agreement at a purchase price equal to (i) zero plus (ii) solely to the extent that such unfunded commitment has paid OID, upfront fees or other similar fees, the Additional Consideration minus (iii) OID, upfront fees and other similar fees on account of such unfunded commitment. The above purchase price calculations are subject to adjustment in certain circumstances under the Facility Agreement. 
 In connection with investments, including related unfunded commitments, underwritten primarily on investments backed by large and diversified pools of financial hard and contractual assets, or Warehouse Asset Based Finance Investments, following fulfillment of the conditions precedent to the Company s obligations to purchase any Warehouse Asset Based Finance Investments under the Facility Agreement, the Company will purchase such Warehouse Asset Based Finance Investments owned and held by the Financing Provider under the Facility Agreement at a purchase price equal to (i) the funded cost of such Warehouse Asset Based Finance Investments, minus (ii) the amount of any PIK interest accrued during the Holding Period, minus (iii) the amount of any OID upfront fees and other similar fees on account of such Warehouse Asset Based Finance Investments during the Holding Period, minus (iv) an amount equal to 11 per annum (or, after the one year anniversary of the date the Financing Provider acquired the Warehouse Asset Based Finance Investments, 12 on the aggregate funded investment cost during the Holding Period of such Warehouse Asset Based Finance Investments, minus, (v) the amount of interest, dividends, fees and other amounts (other than proceeds of principal and other amounts paid on account of indemnification and reimbursement expenses) received by the Financing Provider during the Holding Period on account of such Warehouse Asset Based Finance Investments. This purchase price calculation is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances under the Facility Agreement. Except as set forth above, the Company receives all other economics arising before, during and after the Holding Period on such Asset-Based Finance. 
 In the event the settlement date for any purchase by the Company occurs (i) on or before seven business days after the applicable trade date, such date, a Delayed Comp Trigger Date, the above amounts received by the Financing Provider will be 
 45 

Table of Contents 

 extended to the Delayed Comp Trigger Date and (ii) after the seventh business days after the applicable trade date (in the event such purchase has not occurred by way of a participation), the amounts received by the Financing Provider will include the amounts set forth in the foregoing clause (i) through the Delayed Comp Trigger Date and will also include an amount equal to daily simple SOFR plus 11.448 basis points for each day that elapses between the Delayed Comp Trigger Date and the applicable settlement date. The Company will receive all other OID and Fees and all termination fees, prepayment premiums, make-whole or similar fees or payments with respect to such investments. 
 Unless otherwise agreed to by the Company, Cliffwater and the Financing Provider, each investment transaction under the Cliffwater Facility Agreement is expected to be for portfolio investments with a purchase price of at least 1,000 or, if less, the purchase price of all remaining portfolio investments, including related unfunded commitments, held by the Financing Provider. 
 The fair value of the loans under the Cliffwater Facility Agreement is not reflected in the purchase price. As such, for loans, to the extent the Company is required to buy a loan from the Financing Provider, the Company bears the risk of the fair value of such loan falling below the par value. In contrast, to the extent that the Company is not required to buy a loan, the Financing Provider bears the risk of the fair value of such loan falling below such par value. Similarly, for unfunded commitments, to the extent the Company is required to buy an unfunded commitment, it will bear the risk of being required to buy a loan that, upon funding, may be valued below the par value. In contrast, to the extent that the Company is not required to buy a loan, the Financing Provider will bear such risk. 
 The portfolio investments expected to be purchased by the Company from time to time pursuant to the Cliffwater Facility Agreement are expected to generally consist of directly originated loans to middle-market U.S. companies consistent with the Company s investment objective and investment strategies. There are no material differences between the underwriting standards used in the acquisition of the portfolio investments the Company expects to acquire pursuant to the Cliffwater Facility Agreement and the underwriting standards to be employed by FS/KKR Advisor, LLC, the Company s investment adviser, on the Company s behalf for any other portfolio investments to be acquired or held by the Company from time to time. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the conditions precedent to the Company s obligation to purchase any additional investments from the Financing Provider had not been met. The Company does not hold any beneficial interest in the warehouse. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company purchased investments, including unfunded commitments, with a cost of 83,222 from the Financing Provider. As of September 30, 2024, 32,333 of these purchases are included in payable for investments purchased in the statement of assets and liabilities. For the period from October 1, 2024 through November 8, 2024, the Company purchased investments, including unfunded commitments, with a cost of 9,101 from the Financing Provider. 
 As of November 8, 2024, there were 14 loans with an aggregate commitment par value of 46,827, inclusive of 7,637 of unfunded commitments, that the Financing Provider purchased and was holding at the Company s request pursuant to the Facility Agreement. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, 94.0 of our portfolio investments (based on fair value) were debt investments paying variable interest rates, 4.2 were debt investments paying fixed interest rates, 0.8 were other income producing investments and the remaining 1.0 consisted of non-income producing investments. A rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher interest rates applicable to any variable rate investments we hold and to declines in the value of any fixed rate investments we hold. However, many of our variable rate investments provide for an interest rate floor, which may prevent our interest income from increasing until benchmark interest rates increase beyond a threshold amount. To the extent that a substantial portion of our investments may be in variable rate investments, an increase in interest rates beyond this threshold would make it easier for us to meet or exceed the hurdle rate applicable to the subordinated incentive fee on income, and may result in a substantial increase in our net investment income and to the amount of incentive fees payable to the Adviser with respect to our increased pre-incentive fee net investment income. A prolonged reduction in interest rates could reduce our gross investment income and could result in a decrease in our net investment income if such decreases in interest rates are not offset by a corresponding increase in the spread over the specified reference rate that we earn on any portfolio investments, a decrease in our operating expenses or a decrease in the interest rate of our floating interest rate liabilities. 
 Pursuant to the terms of the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility, we borrow at a floating rate based on a benchmark interest rate. To the extent that any present or future credit facilities or other financing arrangements that we enter into are based on a floating interest rate, we will be subject to risks relating to changes in market interest rates. In periods of rising interest rates when we have such debt outstanding, or financing arrangements in effect, our interest expense would increase, which could reduce our net investment income, especially to the extent we hold fixed rate investments. 
 46

 The following table shows the effect over a twelve-month period of changes in interest rates on our interest income, interest expense and net interest income assuming no changes in the composition of our investment portfolio, including the accrual status of our investments, and our financing arrangements in effect as of September 30, 2024 (dollar amounts are presented in thousands):

 (1) Assumes no defaults or prepayments by portfolio companies over the next twelve months. 
 (2) Assumes current debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024, and no changes over the next twelve months. 
 We expect that our long-term investments will be financed primarily with equity and debt. If deemed prudent, we may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to minimize our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. These techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. Adverse developments resulting from changes in interest rates or hedging transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not engage in interest rate hedging activities. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 From time to time, we may make investments that are denominated in a foreign currency that are subject to the effects of exchange rate movements between the foreign currency of each such investment and the U.S. dollar, which may affect future fair values and cash flows, as well as amounts translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our financial statements. 
 The table below presents the effect that a 10 immediate, unfavorable change in the foreign currency exchange rates (i.e. strengthening of the U.S. dollar) would have on the fair value of our investments denominated in foreign currencies as of September 30, 2024, by foreign currency, all other valuation assumptions remaining constant. In addition, the table below presents the par value of our investments denominated in foreign currencies and the notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts in local currency in place as of September 30, 2024 to hedge against foreign currency risks. Dollar amounts are presented in thousands.

 (1) Excludes effect, if any, of any foreign currency hedges. 
 As illustrated in the table above, we use derivative instruments from time to time, including foreign currency forward contracts, to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, we have the ability to borrow in foreign currencies under our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility, which provides a natural hedge with regard to changes in exchange rates between the foreign currencies and U.S. dollar and reduces our exposure to foreign exchange rate differences. We are typically a net receiver of these foreign currencies as related for our international investment positions, and, as a result, our investments denominated in foreign currencies, to the extent not hedged, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the net contractual amount of our foreign currency forward contracts totaled 2,635, all of which related to hedging of our foreign currency denominated debt investments.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. 
 Based on the foregoing, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that we would meet our disclosure obligations. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 Neither we nor the Adviser are currently subject to any material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our businesses. We and the Adviser may from time to time, however, be involved in litigation arising out of our operations in the normal course of business or otherwise. Furthermore, third parties may seek to impose liability on us in connection with the activities of our portfolio companies. While the outcome of any current legal proceedings cannot at this time be predicted with certainty, we do not expect any current matters will materially affect our financial condition or results of operations; however, there can be no assurance whether any pending legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in any future reporting period. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors that appeared under Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Form 10. There are no material changes from the risk factors included within the Form 10. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 Sales of Unregistered Equity Securities 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we issued and sold an aggregate of 4,089,064 Class S shares pursuant to subscription agreements entered into with participating investors for aggregate consideration of 103.7 million. All offers and sales of Class S shares during the three months ended September 30, 2024 were conducted in connection with the Private Offering in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder. We relied, in part, upon representations from each participating investor in the relevant subscription agreement that such investor is an accredited investor as defined in Regulation D under the Securities Act. 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 Common Shares Discretionary Repurchase Program 
 Beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we have commenced a share repurchase program in which we intend to offer to repurchase, in each quarter, up to 5 of our Common Shares outstanding (either by number of shares or aggregate NAV) as of the close of the previous calendar quarter. The Board may amend or suspend the share repurchase program if in its reasonable judgment it deems such action to be in our best interest and the best interest of our shareholders. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter, such as when a repurchase offer would place an undue burden on our liquidity, adversely affect our operations or risk having an adverse impact on the Company that would outweigh the benefit of the repurchase offer. We intend to conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Exchange Act and the 1940 Act. 
 Under our share repurchase program, to the extent we offer to repurchase shares in any particular quarter, we expect to repurchase shares pursuant to quarterly tender offers using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the Valuation Date, which will be the last calendar day of the applicable quarter. Shareholders should keep in mind that if they tender Common Shares in a tender offer with a Valuation Date that is within the 12-month period following the initial issue date of their tendered Common Shares, the Company may repurchase such Common Shares subject to the 2 Early Repurchase Deduction. The Early Repurchase Deduction will be retained by the Company for the benefit of remaining holders of Common Shares. This Early Repurchase Deduction will also generally apply to minimum account repurchases. 
 Shareholders may tender all of the Common Shares that they own in connection with any of our quarterly tender offers. In the event the amount of shares tendered exceeds the repurchase offer amount, shares will be repurchased on a pro rata basis. All unsatisfied repurchase requests must be resubmitted in the next quarterly tender offer, or upon the recommencement of the share repurchase program, as applicable. We will have no obligation to repurchase shares, including if the repurchase would violate the restrictions on distributions under federal law or Delaware law. The limitations and restrictions described above may prevent us from accommodating all repurchase requests made in any quarter. Our share repurchase program has many limitations, including the limitations described above, and should not in any way be viewed as the equivalent of a secondary market. We will offer to repurchase shares on such terms as may be determined by the Board in its complete and absolute discretion unless, in the judgment of the Board, such repurchases would not be in the best interests of our shareholders or would violate applicable law. There is no assurance that the Board will exercise its discretion to offer to repurchase shares or that there will be sufficient funds available to accommodate all of our shareholders requests for repurchase. As a result, we may repurchase less than the full amount of shares that a shareholder requests to have repurchased. If we do not repurchase the full amount of shares that a shareholder has requested to be repurchased, or we determine not to make repurchases of our shares, such shareholder will likely not be able to dispose of its shares, even if we under- 
 49

 perform. Any periodic repurchase offers will be subject in part to our available cash and compliance with the RIC qualification and diversification rules and the 1940 Act. Repurchases of shares from shareholders by the Company will be paid in cash within 65 days of the expiration of the applicable tender offer, after the determination of the relevant NAV per share is finalized. Repurchases will be effective after receipt and acceptance by the Company of eligible written tenders of shares from shareholders by the applicable repurchase offer deadline. 
 On September 3, 2024, we commenced a tender offer (the September 2024 Tender Offer pursuant to which we offered to repurchase up to 304,785 Common Shares tendered prior to 11:59 p.m., E.T. on September 30, 2024 (the September 2024 Tender Offer Expiration Date ). There were no Common Shares validly tendered by shareholders prior to the September 2024 Tender Offer Expiration Date.

 Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management 
 The following table sets forth, as of October 31, 2024, the beneficial ownership of the Company s current trustees, executive officers, each person known to the Company to beneficially own more than 5 of the outstanding Common Shares, and all of the Company s executive officers and trustees as a group. With respect to persons known to us to beneficially own more than 5 of the outstanding Common Shares, we base such knowledge on beneficial ownership filings made by the holders with the SEC and other information known to us. Other than as set forth in the table below, none of our trustees or executive officers are deemed to beneficially own Common Shares. 
 Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act and includes voting or investment power with respect to the Common Shares. There are no Common Shares subject to options that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of October 31, 2024.
