 of the average monthly value of the Company s net assets during the most recently completed quarter and an incentive fee based on the Company s performance. See Note 2 for a discussion of the capital gains and subordinated income incentive fees that the Adviser may be entitled to under the Advisory Agreement. The Adviser has agreed to waive the base management fee and the subordinated incentive fee on income under the Advisory Agreement through March 31, 2025. 
 Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, the Adviser oversees the Company s day-to-day operations, including the provision of general ledger accounting, fund accounting, legal services, investor relations, certain government and regulatory affairs activities, and other administrative services. The Adviser also performs, or oversees the performance of, the Company s corporate operations and required administrative services, which includes being responsible for the financial records that the Company is required to maintain and preparing reports for the Company s shareholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, the Adviser assists the Company in calculating its NAV, overseeing the preparation and filing of tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to the Company s shareholders, and generally overseeing the payment of the Company s expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to the Company by others. 
 Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, the Company reimburses the Adviser for expenses necessary to perform services related to its administration and operations, including the Adviser s allocable portion of the compensation and related expenses of certain personnel of Franklin Square Holdings, L.P., which does business as FS Investments, or FS Investments, and KKR Credit Advisers (US), LLC, or KKR Credit, providing administrative services to the Company on behalf of the Adviser. The Company reimburses the Adviser no less than monthly for all costs and expenses incurred by the Adviser in performing its obligations and providing personnel and facilities under the Administration Agreement. The Adviser allocates the cost of such services to the Company based on factors such as total assets, revenues, time allocations and/or other reasonable metrics. The Board reviews the methodology employed in determining how the expenses are allocated to the Company and the proposed allocation of administrative expenses among the Company and certain affiliates of the Adviser. The Board then assesses the reasonableness of such reimbursements for expenses allocated to the Company based on the breadth, depth and quality of such services as compared to the estimated cost to the Company of obtaining similar services from third-party service providers known to be available. In addition, the Board considers whether any single third-party service provider would be capable of providing all such services at comparable cost and quality. Finally, the Board compares the total amount paid to the Adviser for such services as a percentage of the Company s net assets to the same ratio as reported by other comparable BDCs. 
 Distribution/Servicing Fees

The Placement Agents also coordinate the Company s marketing and distribution efforts with participating brokers and their registered representatives with respect to communications related to the terms of the Private Offering, the Company s investment strategies, material aspects of the Company s operations and subscription procedures. 
 Subject to any applicable Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., or FINRA, limitations on underwriting compensation, the Company is obligated to pay the Placement Agents a shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee, or the Distribution/Servicing Fees, for Class I shares equal to per annum of the aggregate NAV as of the beginning of the first calendar day of the month for the Class I shares. However, pursuant to a fee waiver agreement, or the Rule 12b-1 Fee Waiver Agreement, between the Company and each of the Placement Agents, the Placement Agents have agreed to waive the Distribution/Servicing Fees for Class I shares in full during the term of the Rule 12b-1 Fee Waiver Agreement, and any such waived fees will not be subject to recoupment by the Placement Agents or any other person during or following the term of the Rule 12b-1 Fee Waiver Agreement. The Rule 12b-1 Fee Waiver Agreement will remain in effect until terminated by vote of the Board, including the vote of a majority of the members of the Board who are not interested persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Company, or the Independent Trustees. 
 The distribution and servicing expenses borne by the participating brokers may be different from and substantially less than the amount of Distribution/Servicing Fees charged. Following any termination of the Rule 12b-1 Fee Waiver Agreement, the Distribution/Servicing Fees will be payable to the Placement Agents, but the Placement Agents anticipate that all or a portion of the

 Subject to applicable legal restrictions and the sole discretion of the Company s Board, the Company intends to declare and pay regular cash distributions on a monthly basis. From time to time, the Company may also declare and pay special interim distributions in the form of cash or shares of its Common Shares at the discretion of the Company s Board. These distributions have been or will be paid monthly to shareholders of record as of monthly record dates previously determined by the Company s Board. Shareholders receive the distribution payments in cash or in Common Shares in accordance with their election under the Company s distribution reinvestment plan. The timing and amount of any future distributions to shareholders are subject to applicable legal restrictions and the sole discretion of the Company s Board. 
 The Company may fund its cash distributions to shareholders from any sources of funds legally available to it, including proceeds from the sale of Common Shares in the Private Offering, borrowings, net investment income from operations, capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, non-capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, and dividends or other distributions paid to the Company on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies. The Company has not established limits on the amount of funds it may use from available sources to make distributions. During certain periods, the Company s distributions may exceed its earnings. As a result, it is possible that a portion of the distributions the Company makes may represent a return of capital. A return of capital generally is a return of a shareholder s investment rather than a return of earnings or gains derived from the Company s investment activities. Each year a statement on Form 1099-DIV identifying the sources of the distributions (i.e., paid from ordinary income, paid from net capital gains on the sale of securities, and/or a return of capital, which is a nontaxable distribution) will be mailed to the Company s shareholders. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to pay distributions at a specific rate or at all.

A foreign currency forward contract is a commitment to purchase or sell a foreign currency at a future date at a negotiated forward rate. These contracts are marked-to-market by recognizing the difference between the contract forward exchange rate and the forward market exchange rate on the last day of the period presented as unrealized appreciation or depreciation.

 In addition, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts, as described in Note 7, which were categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as of September 30, 2024. 
 The Board is responsible for overseeing the valuation of the Company s portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to the Adviser s valuation policy. The Board has designated the Adviser as the Company s valuation designee, with day-to-day responsibility for implementing the portfolio valuation process set forth in the Adviser s valuation policy. 
 The Company s investments will consist primarily of debt investments that were acquired directly from the issuer. Debt investments, for which broker quotes are not available, are valued by independent valuation firms, which determine the fair value of such investments by considering, among other factors, the borrower s ability to adequately service its debt, prevailing interest rates for like investments, expected cash flows, call features, anticipated repayments and other relevant terms of the investments. Except as described below, all of the Company s equity/other investments are also valued by independent valuation firms, which determine the fair value of such investments by considering, among other factors, contractual rights ascribed to such investments, as well as various income scenarios and multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, cash flows, net income, revenues or, in limited instances, book value or liquidation value. An investment that is newly issued and purchased near the date of the financial statements is valued at cost if the Adviser determines that the cost of such investment is the best indication of its fair value. Such investments described above are typically classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. Investments that are traded on an active public market are valued at their closing price as of the date of the financial statements and are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. Except as described above, the Adviser typically values the Company s other investments by using the midpoint of the prevailing bid and ask prices from dealers on the date of the relevant period end, which are provided by independent

The Adviser has reviewed the Company s existing contracts and expects the risk of loss to the Company to be remote. 
 The Company is not currently subject to any material legal proceedings and, to the Company s knowledge, no material legal proceedings are threatened against the Company. From time to time, the Company may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of the Company s rights under contracts with its portfolio companies. While the outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not expect that any such proceedings will have a material effect upon its financial condition or results of operations.

Since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company has sufficient liquidity to fund these commitments.

 (1) Per share data may be rounded in order to recompute the ending NAV per share. 
 (2) The per share data was derived by using the weighted average shares outstanding during the applicable period. 
 (3) The per share data for distributions reflect the actual amount of distributions paid per share during the applicable period. 
 (4) The issuance of Common Shares on a per share basis reflects the incremental net asset value changes as a result of the issuance of Common Shares in connection with the Seed Contribution. The issuance of Common Shares at a price that is less than the net asset value per share results in a decrease in net asset value per share. 
 (5) The total return based on NAV for each period presented was calculated by taking the NAV per share as of the end of the applicable period, adding the cash distributions per share that were declared during the period and dividing the total by the NAV per share at the beginning of the period. Total return based on NAV does not consider the effect of any sales commissions or charges that may be incurred in connection with the sale of Common Shares. The historical calculation of total return based on NAV in the table should not be considered a representation of the Company s future total return based on NAV, which may be greater or less than the return shown in the table due to a number of factors, including the Company s ability or inability to make investments in companies that meet its investment criteria, the interest rates payable on the debt securities the Company acquires, the level of the Company s expenses, variations in and the timing of the recognition of realized and unrealized gains or losses, the degree to which the Company encounters competition in its markets and general economic conditions. As a result of these factors, results for any previous period should not be relied upon as being indicative of performance in future periods. The total return calculations set forth above represent the total return on the Company s investment portfolio during the applicable period and do not represent an actual return to shareholders. 
 (6) Weighted average net assets during the applicable period are used for this calculation. Ratios for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are annualized, with the exception of capital gains incentive fees and recoupment of previously waived expenses. Annualized ratios for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the ratios that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024.

 Overview 
 We are an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. Formed as a Delaware statutory trust on February 4, 2022, we are externally managed by the Adviser, which manages our day-to-day operations and provides us with investment advisory and administrative services pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement. The Adviser is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC. We also have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intend to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. We commenced operations concurrent with the initial closing on the Seed Contribution on July 25, 2022. 
 The Adviser oversees (subject to the oversight of the Board, a majority of whom are not interested persons, as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act) the management of our operations and is responsible for making investment decisions with respect to our portfolio pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement. Under the Advisory Agreement, we have agreed to pay the Adviser an annual management fee as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance. 
 We are conducting the continuous Private Offering of our Common Shares in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, including the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D promulgated thereunder, Regulation S under the Securities Act and other exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. 
 Investments 
 Our investment objectives are to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. We seek to meet our investment objectives by: 
 utilizing the experience and expertise of the management team of the Adviser; 
 employing a defensive investment approach focused on long-term credit performance and principal protection; 
 focusing primarily on debt investments in a broad array of private U.S. companies, including middle-market companies, which we define as companies with annual EBITDA of 50 million to 150 million at the time of investment; 
 investing primarily in established, stable enterprises with positive cash flows; and 
 maintaining rigorous portfolio monitoring in an attempt to anticipate and pre-empt negative credit events within our portfolio, such as an event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of a portfolio company. 
 We pursue our investment objective by investing primarily in the debt of private middle market U.S. companies with a focus on originated transactions sourced through the network of the Adviser and its affiliates. We define direct originations as any investment where our investment adviser or its affiliates had negotiated the terms of the transaction beyond just the price, which, for example, may include negotiating financial covenants, maturity dates or interest rate terms. These directly originated transactions include participation in other originated transactions where there may be third parties involved, or a bank acting as an intermediary, for a closely held club, or similar transactions. 
 See Item 1. Business - Investment Objectives and Strategy in the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC for more information.

 Revenues 
 The principal measure of our financial performance is net change in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income, net realized gain or loss on investments, net realized gain or loss on foreign currency, net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments and net unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency. Net investment income is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees and other investment income and our operating and other expenses. Net realized gain or loss on investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their amortized cost, including the respective realized gain or loss on foreign currency for those foreign-denominated investment transactions. Net realized gain or loss on foreign currency is the portion of realized gain or loss attributable to foreign currency fluctuations. Net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio, including the respective unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency for those foreign-denominated investments. Net unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency is the net change in the value of receivables or accruals due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. 
 We principally generate revenues in the form of interest income on the debt investments and asset based finance investments, or ABF Investments, we hold, as well as dividends and other distributions on the equity or other securities we hold. In addition, we generate revenues in the form of non-recurring commitment, closing, origination, structuring or diligence fees, monitoring fees, fees for providing managerial assistance, consulting fees, prepayment fees and performance-based fees. 
 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of management and incentive fees and other expenses under the Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement, interest expense from financing arrangements and other indebtedness, and other expenses necessary for our operations. The management and incentive fees compensate the Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, executing, monitoring and servicing our investments. 
 The Adviser oversees our day-to-day operations, including the provision of general ledger accounting, fund accounting, legal services, investor relations, certain government and regulatory affairs activities, and other administrative services. The Adviser also performs, or oversees the performance of, our corporate operations and required administrative services, which includes being responsible for the financial records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports for our shareholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, the Adviser assists us in calculating our NAV, overseeing the preparation and filing of tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our shareholders, and generally overseeing the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. 
 Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, we reimburse the Adviser for expenses necessary to perform services related to our administration and operations, including the Adviser s allocable portion of the compensation and related expenses of certain personnel of FS Investments and KKR Credit providing administrative services to us on behalf of the Adviser. We reimburse the Adviser no less than monthly for all costs and expenses incurred by the Adviser in performing its obligations and providing personnel and facilities under the Administration Agreement. The Adviser allocates the cost of such services to us based on factors such as total assets, revenues, time allocations and/or other reasonable metrics. The Board reviews the methodology employed in determining how the expenses are allocated to us and the proposed allocation of administrative expenses among us and certain affiliates of the Adviser. The Board then assesses the reasonableness of such reimbursements for expenses allocated to us based on the breadth, depth and quality of such services as compared to the estimated cost to us of obtaining similar services from third-party service providers known to be available. In addition, the Board considers whether any single third-party service provider would be capable of providing all such services at comparable cost and quality. Finally, the Board compares the total amount paid to the Adviser for such services as a percentage of our net assets to the same ratio as reported by other comparable BDCs. 
 Except as provided in the Administration Agreement and the Advisory Agreement, we bear all expenses of our operations and transactions, including all other expenses incurred by the Adviser in performing services for us and administrative personnel paid by the Adviser, subject to the limitations included in the Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement. See Note 4 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein for more information regarding the expenses borne by us and, thus, our shareholders. 
 In addition, we have contracted with State Street Bank and Trust Company to provide various accounting and administrative services, including, but not limited to, preparing preliminary financial information for review by the Adviser, preparing and monitoring expense budgets, maintaining accounting and corporate books and records, processing trade information provided by us and performing testing with respect to RIC compliance. We pay State Street Bank and Trust Company directly for the costs of such services. 
 The Adviser has agreed to advance all of our organizational and offering expenses on our behalf (including legal, accounting, printing, mailing, subscription processing and filing fees and expenses and other offering expenses, including costs associated with technology integration between our systems and those of our participating brokers, reasonable bona fide due diligence expenses of participating brokers supported by detailed and itemized invoices, costs in connection with preparing sales materials and other

 marketing expenses, design and website expenses, fees and expenses of our transfer agent, fees to attend retail seminars sponsored by participating brokers and costs, expenses and reimbursements for travel (provided that we shall not be required to bear the cost of private airfare in excess of comparable first-class/business rates on a commercial airline, if available), meals, accommodations, entertainment and other similar expenses related to meetings or events with prospective investors, brokers, registered investment advisors or financial or other advisors, but excluding the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee) through a date determined by the Adviser in its discretion. We had no obligation to reimburse the Adviser for such advanced expenses until the initial issuance of Common Shares to non-affiliated investors after commencement of the monthly closings for the Private Offering, which commenced on March 1, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had incurred organizational and offering expenses of 991 and 3,190, respectively, which expenses the Adviser elected to cover pursuant to the Expense Support Agreement, subject to reimbursement by the Company pursuant to its terms. See Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement below for more information. In no event will we bear in excess of 1.5 million in organizational expenses; the Adviser has agreed to be responsible for any organizational expenses in excess of 1.5 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reimbursed 2,290 of organizational and offering expenses. 
 From time to time, the Adviser or its affiliates may pay third-party providers of goods or services. We will reimburse the Adviser or such affiliates thereof for any such amounts paid on our behalf. From time to time, the Adviser may defer or waive fees and/or rights to be reimbursed for expenses. All of the foregoing expenses will ultimately be borne by our shareholders. 
 Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement 
 The Company has entered into an Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement, or the Expense Support Agreement, with the Adviser. The Adviser may elect to pay certain of our expenses on the Company s behalf, including, but not limited to, organizational and offering expenses and any of the Company s expenses related to investor relations, outside legal counsel and other outside advisors and experts, finance, operations and administration, each, an Expense Payment, provided that no portion of the payment will be used to pay any interest expense or distribution and/or shareholder servicing fees of the Company. Any Expense Payment that the Adviser has committed to pay must be paid by the Adviser to the Company in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds no later than 90 days after such commitment was made in writing, and/or offset against amounts due from us to the Adviser or its affiliates. 
 Following any calendar month in which Available Operating Funds (as defined below) exceed the cumulative distributions accrued to the Company s shareholders based on distributions declared with respect to record dates occurring in such calendar month (the amount of such excess referred to as Excess Operating Funds), the Company will pay such Excess Operating Funds, or a portion thereof, to the Adviser until such time as all Expense Payments made by the Adviser to the Company within three years prior to the last business day of such calendar month have been reimbursed. Any payments required to be made by the Company are referred to as a Reimbursement Payment. Available Operating Funds means the sum of (i) the Company s net investment income (excluding organizational and offering costs and extraordinary expenses, taxes (including excise tax) and accrued capital gains incentive fees on unrealized appreciation) and (ii) the Company s net capital gains. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023 , the Adviser has agreed to pay 0 and 147, respectively, in Expense Payments, subject to reimbursement by the Company in accordance with the Expense Support Agreement. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reimbursed the Adviser for 436 of previously waived expenses. As of September 30, 2024, there are no amounts of previously waived expenses subject to recoupment.

 Fees and Expenses 
 The following table illustrates the aggregate fees and expenses that the Company expects to incur and that shareholders can expect to bear, either directly or indirectly, during the following twelve months. 
 Shareholder transaction expenses (fees paid directly from shareholder investment) Maximum sales load imposed on purchases (1) 
 Annual operating expenses (as a percentage of average net assets attributable to shares) (2) 
 Base management fee (3) 
 1.25 Incentive fees payable under our investment advisory agreement (4) 
 Interest payments on borrowed funds (5) 
 4.55 Distribution fee (6) 
 Organizational and offering costs (7) 
 0.16 Other expenses (8) 
 0.57 Total annual expenses 6.53 Waiver of management and subordinated income incentive fees (3) 
 (0.63) Net annual expenses 5.90 
 _______________ 
 (1) If Class I shares are purchased through certain financial intermediaries, they may directly charge transaction or other fees, including upfront placement fees or brokerage commissions, in such amount as they may determine, provided that selling agents limit such charges to a 3.5 cap on NAV for Class I shares. In connection with the sales of Class I shares, participating broker-dealers may charge investors a placement fee, subject to the discretion of the broker-dealer. Any such placement fee is not part of (and is in addition to) an investor s aggregate purchase price for its Class I shares and will be directly charged to such investor. 
 (2) Amount assumes that we sell 794.1 million worth of Class I shares during the following twelve months, resulting in estimated average net assets of 1,013.7 million based on current asset levels. That amount also assumes that we borrow funds of approximately 70 of our average net assets during such period. Actual expenses will depend on the number of Class I shares we sell in the Private Offering and the amount of leverage we employ, if any. There can be no assurance that we will sell 794.1 million worth of Class I shares during the following twelve months. 
 (3) The Management Fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of 1.25 of our average monthly net assets during such period. The Adviser has agreed to waive the management and subordinated income incentive fees through March 31, 2025. 
 (4) Based on our current business plan, we anticipate that we may have capital gains and interest income that could result in the payment of an incentive fee to the Adviser in the following twelve months. However, the incentive fee payable to the Adviser is based on our performance and will not be paid unless we achieve certain performance targets. As we cannot predict whether we will meet the necessary performance targets, we have assumed that no incentive fee will be paid for purposes of this table. We expect the incentive fees we pay to increase to the extent we earn greater interest income through our investments in portfolio companies, and realize capital gains upon the sale of investments in our portfolio companies. 
 (5) We may borrow funds to make investments, including before we have fully invested the initial proceeds of the Private Offering. To the extent that we determine it is appropriate to borrow funds to make investments, the costs associated with such borrowing will be indirectly borne by our shareholders. The figure in the table assumes we borrow for investment purposes an amount of approximately 70 of our average net assets (including such borrowed funds) during such period and that the annual interest rate on the amount borrowed is 6.5 . 
 Our ability to incur leverage during the following twelve months depends, in large part, on the amount of money we are able to raise through the sale of Class I shares in the Private Offering and capital markets conditions. 
 (6) Distribution fees reflect an annual shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee of 0.85 per annum of the aggregate NAV as of the beginning of the first calendar day of the month for the Class I shares. However, pursuant to a fee waiver agreement, or the Rule 12b-1 Fee Waiver Agreement, between the Company and each of the Placement Agents, the Company s principal placement agents for the Private Offering and affiliates of the Adviser, the Placement Agents have agreed to waive the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees for Class I shares in full during the term of the Rule 12b-1 Fee Waiver Agreement, and any such waived fees will not be subject to recoupment by the Placement Agents or any other person during or following the term of the Rule 12b-1 Fee Waiver Agreement. The Rule 12b-1 Fee Waiver Agreement will remain in effect until terminated by vote of the Board (including a vote of a majority of its independent trustees). 
 (7) Amount reflects estimated organizational and offering costs to be paid by us of up to approximately 1.6 million if we raise 794.1 million in gross proceeds. The Adviser has agreed to advance all of our organizational and offering expenses on our behalf through a date determined by the Adviser in its discretion. We will reimburse the Adviser for any such amounts paid on our behalf pursuant to the terms of the Expense Support Agreement. See Expenses and Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement sections above for more information. 
 (8) Other expenses primarily include accounting, legal and auditing fees, as well as the reimbursement of the compensation of administrative personnel and fees payable to our directors who do not also serve in an executive officer capacity for us or the Adviser. The amount presented in the table reflects estimated amounts we expect to pay during the following twelve months and does not include preferred pricing arrangements we may receive from certain parties as a newly formed entity.

Portfolio Asset Quality 
 In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, the Adviser uses an investment rating system to characterize and monitor the expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. The Adviser uses an investment rating scale of 1 to 4. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating: 
 Investment Rating Summary Description 1 Performing investment generally executing in accordance with plan and there are no concerns about the portfolio company s performance or ability to meet covenant requirements. 2 Performing investment no concern about repayment of both interest and our cost basis but company s recent performance or trends in the industry require closer monitoring. 3 Underperforming investment some loss of interest or dividend possible, but still expecting a positive return on investment. 4 Underperforming investment concerns about the recoverability of principal or interest.

 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Amount Percentage of Total Income Amount Percentage of Total Income Amount Percentage of Total Income Amount Percentage of Total Income Interest income 19,945 89.0 3,884 86.8 42,995 87.6 4,586 84.5 Fee income 2,261 10.1 509 11.4 4,820 9.8 760 14.0 Dividend income 201 0.9 81 1.8 1,272 2.6 81 1.5 Total investment income (1) 
 22,407 100.0 4,474 100.0 49,087 100.0 5,427 100.0 
 ___________ 
 (1) Such revenues represent 20,964 and 4,399 of cash income earned as well as 1,443 and 75 in non-cash portions relating to accretion of discount and PIK interest for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Such revenues represent 46,793 and 5,337 of cash income earned as well as 2,294 and 90 in non-cash portions relating to accretion of discount and PIK interest for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash flows related to such non-cash revenues may not occur for a number of reporting periods or years after such revenues are recognized. 
 The level of interest income we receive is generally related to the balance of income-producing investments, multiplied by the weighted average yield of our investments. We expect the dollar amount of interest and any dividend income that we earn to increase as the size of our investments portfolio increases. 
 The increase in interest income, fee income and dividend income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily due to the increase in the size of our investment portfolio.

 __________ 
 (1) Ratio data may be rounded in order to recompute the ending ratio of net operating expenses to average net assets or net operating expenses, excluding certain expenses, to average net assets. 
 
 We generally expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of our average net assets because of the anticipated growth in the size of our asset base. 
 The increase in expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily due to the increase in the size of our investment portfolio, the acceleration of our operational activity during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the incurrence of borrowings under the K-FIT AB-1 Credit Facility and the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Interest expense, among other things, may increase or decrease our expense ratios relative to comparative periods depending on portfolio performance, changes in amounts outstanding under our financing arrangements and benchmark interest rates such as SOFR, among other factors. 
 Net Investment Income 
 Our net investment income totaled 16,037 0.87 per share) and 3,193 0.63 per share) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in net investment income during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 can primarily be attributed to the increase in interest, fee and dividend income discussed above. 
 Our net investment income totaled 33,075 2.53 per share) and 3,494 1.70 per share) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in net investment income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 can primarily be attributed to the increase in interest, fee and dividend income discussed above.

 Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) 
 Our net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments, foreign currency forward contracts and unrealized gain (loss) on foreign currency for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments 3,211 1,335 8,735 3,083 Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on foreign currency forward contracts (113) (119) Net change in unrealized gain (loss) on foreign currency (962) 348 (793) 351 Total net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) 2,136 1,683 7,823 3,434 
 The net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven primarily by appreciation on several specific assets in the portfolio. 
 Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the net increase in net assets resulting from operations was 18,011 0.98 per share) compared to a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of 4,824 0.94 per share) for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net increase in net assets resulting from operations was 40,843 3.12 per share) compared to a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of 6,891 3.34 per share) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 We intend to generate cash primarily from the net proceeds from the Private Offering and from cash flows from interest and fees earned from our investments and principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. We may also fund a portion of our investments through borrowings from banks and issuances of senior securities, including before we have fully invested the proceeds of the Private Offering. Our primary use of cash will be investments in portfolio companies, payments of our expenses, including management fees, incentive fees and interest expenses, payment of cash distributions to our shareholders and repurchases of our Common Shares under our discretionary share repurchase program. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had received capital commitments of 420,000 from investors in the Private Offering, and have called an aggregate of 250,500 in capital contributions in exchange for 8,861,448 in Class I shares in connection with such commitments. 
 48 

Table of Contents 

 As of September 30, 2024, we had 37,615 in cash and foreign currency, which we held in custodial accounts, and 152,772 in borrowings available under our financing arrangements, subject to borrowing base and other limitations. As of September 30, 2024, we had unfunded debt investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of 223,540 and unfunded equity/other commitments of 44,492. We maintain sufficient cash on hand, available borrowings and liquid securities to fund such unfunded commitments should the need arise. 
 We intend to utilize leverage to finance our investments. The amount of leverage that we employ will be subject to the restrictions of the 1940 Act and the supervision of the Board. At the time of any proposed borrowing, the amount of leverage we employ will also depend on our Adviser s assessment of market and other factors. We have established credit facilities and other financing arrangements, and intend to establish one or more additional credit facilities or enter into other financing arrangements to facilitate investments and the timely payment of our expenses. 
 Asset Coverage 
 Under the provisions of the 1940 Act, following approval from our initial shareholders of the reduced asset coverage requirements under Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, which approval became effective on July 26, 2022, we are currently permitted to issue senior securities only in amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 150 after each issuance of senior securities. For purposes of the 1940 Act, asset coverage means the ratio of (1) the total assets of a BDC, less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, to (2) the aggregate amount of senior securities representing indebtedness (plus, in the case of senior securities represented by preferred stock, the aggregate involuntary liquidation preference of such BDC s preferred stock). Under the 1940 Act, any Preferred Shares we issue, including the Series A Preferred Shares, will constitute a senior security for purposes of the 150 asset coverage test. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we will be required to make provisions to prohibit any dividend distribution to our shareholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the dividend distribution or repurchase. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate amount outstanding of the senior securities issued by us was 222,743. As of September 30, 2024, our asset coverage ratio as calculated under the 1940 Act was 377 . 
 Prior to investing in securities of portfolio companies, we invest the cash received from fees, interest and dividends earned from our investments and principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments primarily in cash, cash equivalents, including money market funds, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt instruments maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, consistent with our BDC election and our election to be taxed as a RIC.

 See Note 9 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding our financing arrangements. 
 
 RIC Status and Distributions 
 We have elected to be subject to tax as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In order to qualify for RIC tax treatment, we must, among other things, make distributions of an amount at least equal to 90 of our investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for distributions paid, each tax year. As long as the distributions are declared by the later of the fifteenth day of the tenth month following the close of a tax year or the due date of the tax return for such tax year, including 
 49 

Table of Contents 

 extensions, distributions paid up to twelve months after the current tax year can be carried back to the prior tax year for determining the distributions paid in such tax year. We intend to make sufficient distributions to our shareholders to qualify for and maintain our RIC tax status each tax year. We are also subject to a 4 nondeductible federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we make distributions in a timely manner to our shareholders generally of an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98 of our net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (2) 98.2 of our capital gain net income, which is the excess of capital gains in excess of capital losses, or capital gain net income (adjusted for certain ordinary losses), for the one-year period ending October 31 of that calendar year and (3) any net ordinary income and capital gain net income for the preceding years that were not distributed during such years and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax. Any distribution declar ed by us during October, November or December of any calendar year, payable to shareholders of record on a specified date in such a month and actually paid during January of the following calendar year, will be treated as if it had been paid by us, as well as received by our shareholders, on December 31 of the calendar year in which the distribution was declared. We can offer no assurance that we will achieve results that will permit us to pay any cash distributions. 
 Subject to applicable legal restrictions, and to the extent that we have taxable income available, we intend to make distributions to holders of our Common Shares and Preferred Shares. We intend to make monthly distributions to holders of our Common Shares and such distributions are recorded on the record date. All such distributions will be paid at the discretion of the Board and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, maintenance of our tax treatment as a RIC, compliance with applicable BDC regulations and such other factors as the Board may deem relevant from time to time. 
 The IRS currently requires that a RIC has two or more classes of stock allocate to each such class proportionate amounts of each type of its income (such as ordinary income and capital gains) based upon the percentage of total dividends paid to each class for the tax year. Accordingly, while our Preferred Shares are outstanding, we intend to allocate capital gain dividends, if any, between our Common Shares and Preferred Shares in proportion to the total dividends paid to each class with respect to such tax year. 
 We intend to make dividends and distributions to our preferred shareholders semi-annually on or before June 30 and December 31 of each year. Dividends and distributions to preferred shareholders will be payable to holders of record at the close of business on the applicable record date, which shall be the fifteenth day of the calendar month in which the applicable dividend payment date falls or on such other date designated by the Board for the payment of dividends to preferred shareholders that is not more than 30 nor less than ten days prior to such dividend payment date. 
 During certain periods, our distributions may exceed our earnings. As a result, it is possible that a portion of the distributions we make may represent a return of capital. A return of capital generally is a return of a shareholder s investment rather than a return of earnings or gains derived from our investment activities. Each year a statement on Form 1099-DIV identifying the sources of the distributions will be mailed to our shareholders. No portion of the distributions paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 represented a return of capital. 
 We intend to make our regular distributions in the form of cash, out of assets legally available for distribution, except for those shareholders who have elected to receive their distributions in the form of additional Common Shares under our distribution reinvestment plan. Any distributions reinvested under the plan will nevertheless remain taxable to a U.S. shareholder. 
 The following table reflects the cash distributions per share that we have declared on our Common Shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2024:

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management utilizes available information, including our past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming the estimates and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We describe our most significant accounting policies in Note 2 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein. 
 Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments required by our policies on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary based on changing conditions. We have identified one of our accounting policies, valuation of portfolio investments, specifically the valuation of Level 3 investments, as critical because it involves significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters, and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a 
 51 

Table of Contents 

 material impact on our reported results of operations or financial condition. As we execute our operating plans, we will describe additional critical accounting policies in the notes to our future financial statements in addition to those discussed below and in the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our investment portfolio, valued at fair value in accordance with our Board-approved valuation policy, represented 94.37 of our total assets, as compared to 75.25 of our total assets as of December 31, 2023 . 
 Valuation of Portfolio Investments and Determination of NAV 
 Valuation of Portfolio Investments 
 The Board is responsible for overseeing the valuation of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to the Adviser s valuation policy. As permitted by Rule 2a-5 of the 1940 Act, the Board has designated the Adviser as our valuation designee with day-to-day responsibility for implementing the portfolio valuation process set forth in the Adviser s valuation policy. 
 Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure , or ASC Topic 820, issued by the FASB clarifies the definition of fair value and requires companies to expand their disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 also establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical securities; Level 2, which includes inputs such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets and quoted prices for identical securities where there is little or no activity in the market; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. 
 The Adviser determines the fair value of our investment portfolio on at least a quarterly basis. Securities that are publicly-traded with readily available market prices will be valued at the reported closing price on the valuation date. Securities that are not publicly-traded with readily available market prices will be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser, in accordance with valuation policies approved by the Board. In connection with that determination, the Adviser will prepare portfolio company valuations which are based on relevant inputs, including, but not limited to, indicative dealer quotes, values of like securities, recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts, and valuations prepared by independent third-party pricing and valuation services. 
 With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, we undertake a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below: 
 our quarterly fair valuation process begins by the Adviser facilitating the delivery of updated quarterly financial and other information relating to each investment to an independent third-party pricing or valuation service; 
 the independent third-party pricing or valuation service then reviews and analyzes the information, along with relevant market and economic data, and determines proposed valuations for each portfolio company or investment according to the valuation methodologies in the Adviser s valuation policy and communicates the information to the Adviser in the form of a valuation range for Level 3 assets; 
 the Adviser then reviews the preliminary valuation information for each portfolio company or investment and provides feedback about the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of the valuation-related inputs considered by the independent third-party pricing or valuation service and any suggested revisions thereto prior to the independent third-party pricing or valuation service finalizing its valuation range; 
 the Adviser then provides the Board s valuation committee with its valuation determinations and valuation-related information for each portfolio company or investment, along with any applicable supporting materials; and other information that is relevant to the fair valuation process as required by the Adviser s Board-reporting obligations; 
 the Board s valuation committee meets with the Adviser to receive the relevant quarterly reporting from the Adviser and to discuss any questions from the valuation committee in connection with the valuation committee s role in overseeing the fair valuation process; and 
 following the completion of its fair value oversight activities, the valuation committee (with the assistance of the Adviser) provides the Board with a report regarding the quarterly valuation process. 
 In circumstances where the Adviser deems appropriate, the Adviser s internal valuation team values certain investments. When performing the internal valuations, the Adviser utilizes similar valuation techniques as an independent third-party pricing service 
 52 

Table of Contents 

 would use. Such valuations are approved by an internal valuation committee of the Adviser, with oversight from the valuation committee of the Board, as described above. 
 Determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations and any change in such valuations on our consolidated financial statements. In making its determination of fair value, the Adviser may use any independent third-party pricing or valuation services for which it has performed the appropriate level of due diligence. However, the Adviser is not required to determine fair value in accordance with the valuation provided by any single source, and may use any relevant data, including information sourced by the Adviser or provided by any independent third-party valuation or pricing service that the Adviser deems to be reliable in determining fair value under the circumstances. Below is a description of factors that the Adviser and any independent third-party valuation services may consider when determining the fair value of our investments. 
 The valuation methods utilized for each portfolio company may vary depending on industry and company-specific considerations. Typically, the first step is to make an assessment as to the enterprise value of the portfolio company s business in order to establish whether the portfolio company s enterprise value is greater than the amount of its debt as of the valuation date. This analysis helps to determine a risk profile for the applicable portfolio company and its related investments, and the appropriate valuation methodology to utilize as part of the security valuation analysis. The enterprise valuation may be determined using a market or income approach. 
 Valuation of fixed income investments, such as loans and debt securities, depends upon a number of factors, including prevailing interest rates for like securities, expected volatility in future interest rates, call features, put features and other relevant terms of the debt. For investments without readily available market prices, the Adviser may incorporate these factors into discounted cash flow models to arrive at fair value. Various methods may be used to determine the appropriate discount rate in a discounted cash flow model. 
 Domestic and foreign fixed-income instruments and non-exchange traded derivatives are normally valued on the basis of quotes obtained from brokers and dealers or pricing services using data reflecting the earlier closing of the principal markets for those securities. Bank loans, including senior secured floating rate and fixed-rate loans, are valued by using readily available market quotations or another commercially reasonable method selected by an independent, third-party pricing service that has been engaged by the Adviser, or, if such independent, third-party valuations are not available, by using broker quotations. Senior secured adjustable, variable or floating rate loans for which an active secondary market exists to a reliable degree will be valued at the bid price in the market for such loans, as provided by a loan pricing service. Directly originated loans are valued on an individual loan level. In doing so, the Adviser may engage an independent, third-party valuation agent, and fair valuation of such loans will be performed using inputs that incorporate borrower level data, including significant events affecting the issuer or collateral and market developments. Prices obtained from independent pricing services use information provided by market makers or estimates of market values obtained from yield data relating to investments or securities with similar characteristics. Exchange traded options, futures and options on futures are valued at the settlement price determined by the relevant exchange. The value of swaps, including credit default swaps, total return swaps and interest rate swaps will be determined by obtaining at least one dealer quotation (including information from counterparties) or valuations from third-party pricing services. If no quotations or valuations are available, or if such quotations or valuations are believed to be unreliable, swaps will be fair valued pursuant to procedures adopted by the Adviser and overseen by the Board. 
 Other factors that may be considered include the borrower s ability to adequately service its debt, the fair market value of the borrower in relation to the face amount of its outstanding debt and the quality of collateral securing the debt investments. 
 For convertible debt securities, fair value generally approximates the fair value of the debt plus the fair value of an option to purchase the underlying security (i.e., the security into which the debt may convert) at the conversion price. To value such an option, a standard option pricing model may be used. 
 Our equity interests in portfolio companies for which there is no liquid public market are valued at fair value. Generally, the value of our equity interests in public companies for which market quotations are readily available is based upon the most recent closing public market price. Portfolio securities that carry certain restrictions on sale are typically valued at a discount from the public market value of the security. The Adviser will normally use pricing data for domestic or foreign equity securities received shortly after the close of the primary securities exchange on which such securities trade and does not normally take into account trading, clearances or settlements that take place after the close of the exchange. 
 When we receive warrants or other equity securities at nominal or no additional cost in connection with an investment in a debt security, the cost basis in the investment will be allocated between the debt securities and any such warrants or other equity securities received at the time of origination. The Adviser subsequently values these warrants or other equity securities received at their fair value.

 See Note 8 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding the fair value of our financial instruments. 
 Determination of NAV 
 We expect to determine our NAV for the Common Shares each month as of the last day of each calendar month, and in no event less frequently than quarterly. The NAV per share for our Common Shares is determined by dividing the value of total assets attributable to the Common Shares minus liabilities attributable to the Common Shares by the total number of Common Shares outstanding at the date as of which the determination is made. We will use the valuation procedures set forth above in order to determine our NAV, as applied by the Adviser as our valuation designee under Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act. Fair value pricing may require subjective determinations about the value of a security. If events materially affecting the price of foreign portfolio securities occur between the time when their price was last determined on such foreign securities exchange or market and the time when our NAV was last calculated (for example, movements in certain U.S. securities indices which demonstrate strong correlation to movements in certain foreign securities markets), such securities may be valued at their fair value as determined in good faith in accordance with procedures established by the Adviser and overseen by the Board. 
 For purposes of calculating NAV, all assets and liabilities initially expressed in foreign currencies will be converted into U.S. dollars at prevailing exchange rates as may be determined in good faith by the Adviser under the supervision of the Board. Although the Adviser s policy is intended to result in a calculation of our NAV that fairly reflects security values as of the time of pricing, we cannot ensure that fair values determined by the Adviser would accurately reflect the price that we could obtain for a security if it were to dispose of that security as of the time of pricing (for instance, in a forced or distressed sale). The prices used by the Adviser when determining fair value may differ from the value that would be realized if the securities were sold. 
 The NAV calculation is available generally within 20 business days after the end of the applicable month. Changes in our monthly NAV will reflect factors including, but not limited to, accruals for net portfolio income, interest expense and unrealized/realized gains (losses) on assets, any applicable organizational and offering costs and any expense reimbursements. When the Adviser determines NAV as of a day that is not the last day of a calendar quarter in connection with a drawdown on capital commitments or, for monthly closings to investors for immediate cash investment, as of the last day of a month that is not also the last day of a calendar quarter, we intend to update the value of securities with reliable market quotations to the most recent market quotation. For securities without reliable market quotations, the Adviser s valuation team will generally value such assets at the most recent quarterly valuation unless the Adviser determines that a significant observable change has occurred since the most recent quarter-end with respect to the investment (which determination may be as a result of a material event at a portfolio company, material change in market spreads, secondary market transaction in the securities of an investment or otherwise). If the Adviser determines such a change has occurred with respect to one or more investments, the Adviser will determine whether to update the value for each relevant investment using a range of values from an independent valuation firm, where applicable, in accordance with the Adviser s valuation policy, pursuant to authority designated by the Board. Additionally, the Adviser may otherwise determine to update the most recent quarter-end valuation of an investment without reliable market quotations that the Adviser considers to be material to the Company using a range of values from an independent valuation firm. 
 The most recently determined NAV per share for the Common Shares will be reported by the Company under cover of a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 We have entered into the Advisory Agreement and Administration Agreement with the Adviser to provide us with investment advisory and administrative services. Payments for investment advisory services under the Advisory Agreement are equal to (a) an annual base management fee based on the average monthly value of the Company s net assets during the most recently completed calendar quarter, and (b) an incentive fee based on our performance. The Adviser is reimbursed for administrative expenses incurred on our behalf. See Note 4 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein for a discussion of these agreements and for the amount of fees and expenses accrued under these agreements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 If any of our contractual obligations are terminated, our costs may increase under any new agreements that we enter into as replacements. We would also likely incur expenses in locating alternative parties to provide the services we expect to receive under our Advisory Agreement and our Administration Agreement. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We may become a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of our business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2024 , we had off-balance sheet arrangements with the Financing Provider under the Cliffwater Facility Agreement, as described below.

 Warehousing Transaction 
 On May 9, 2024, the Company entered into the A R Cliffwater Facility Agreement with the Financing Provider to acquire portfolio investments from time to time by purchasing all or a portion of certain investments owned and held by the applicable Financing Provider at the Company s or the applicable Financing Provider s request pursuant to the terms and provisions of the A R Cliffwater Facility Agreement. The Cliffwater Facility Agreement creates a forward obligation of the applicable Financing Provider to sell, and a forward obligation of the Company or its designee to purchase, all or a portion of certain investments owned and held by the applicable Financing Provider at the Company s or the applicable Financing Provider s request pursuant to the terms and conditions of the A R Cliffwater Facility Agreement. Prior to the date on which (i) an insolvency proceeding is commenced by the Company or (ii) an insolvency proceeding is commenced against the Company and is not dismissed or stayed within 60 days, such date referred to as the Facility End Date, the Company s obligation to purchase such investments is conditional upon satisfying certain conditions, including the Capital Condition. The Company made customary representations and warranties in the A R Cliffwater Facility Agreement. 
 Subject to satisfaction of the Capital Condition, the A R Cliffwater Facility Agreement provides that the applicable Financing Provider can require the Company to purchase from the applicable Financing Provider such investments entered into in connection with the A R Cliffwater Facility Agreement (x) with respect to such investment initially acquired by the applicable Financing Provider prior to the date that the Company has raised investor subscriptions that are callable, have been called or received in an aggregate amount of at least 750,000, such date referred to as the Subscription Threshold Date, in an amount up to 3.0 of the aggregate subscriptions that the Company has raised on or prior to the trade date of any purchase and (y) with respect to such investment initially acquired by the applicable Financing Provider on or after the Subscription Threshold Date, in an amount up to 2.0 of the aggregate subscriptions that the Company has raised on or prior to the trade date of any purchase. Such purchases will be at the prices determined under the A R Cliffwater Facility Agreement, as discussed further below; provided that, (i) the Company may, on one occasion, extend the Facility End Date by three months and (ii) if no notice requiring a purchase or sale, as applicable, of such investments is delivered in accordance with the A R Cliffwater Facility Agreement by the Facility End Date, none of the parties to the A R Facility Agreement may require the other party to purchase or sell, as applicable, such investments after the Facility End Date. 
 The applicable Financing Provider will receive during the period commencing on the date the applicable Financing Provider acquires an investment and ending on the date immediately preceding the trade date of such investment, or the Holding Period, (i) all principal proceeds, all OID and Fees (as defined in the A R Cliffwater Facility Agreement) paid on account of any portion of an underlying purchased loan that is repaid or prepaid and not available to be reborrowed and an available unfunded commitment that has been terminated, not funded and is not available to be reborrowed by the underlying obligor and all amendment fees on such investments it holds pursuant to the A R Cliffwater Facility Agreement, in each case, during the Holding Period, (ii) all cash interest and payment-in-kind interest and all fees (other than one-time fees) that regularly accrue and are payable to all lenders under the underlying documents for such investments on account of such lenders loans or commitments outstanding pursuant to such underlying documents, in each case, during the Holding Period and (iii) additional consideration for any such investments transferred to the purchaser that have paid OID and Fees prior to the trade date during the Holding Period equal to an amount from 0.25 to 1.50 (based on the length of time such asset is held by the applicable Financing Provider) of the par value or unfunded amount, as applicable, of any such investment as of immediately prior to any transfer of such investment by the applicable Financing Provider to the Fund, the consideration under this clause (iii), the Additional Consideration. 
 Unless otherwise agreed to by the Company, Cliffwater, and CCLF SUB, each investment transaction under the A R Cliffwater Facility Agreement is expected to be for portfolio investments with a purchase price of at least 1.0 million or, if less, the purchase price of all remaining portfolio investments, including related unfunded commitments, held by the applicable Financing Provider. 
 Following fulfillment of the conditions precedent to the Company s obligations to purchase any loans under the A R Cliffwater Facility Agreement, the Company will purchase such loans owned and held by the applicable Financing Provider under the A R Cliffwater Facility Agreement at a purchase price equal to (i) the par amount of such loan plus, without duplication, (ii) PIK interest accrued during the Holding Period and PIK interest accrued but not capitalized prior to the Holding Period minus (iii) the sum of (x) OID, upfront fees and other similar fees on account of such purchase loan (all of which are attributable to the Holding Period) plus (y) any termination fees or other similar fees during the Holding Period plus (iv) solely to the extent that such loan has paid OID, upfront fees or other similar fees, the Additional Consideration. 
 Similarly, following fulfillment of the conditions precedent to the Company s obligations to purchase any unfunded commitments under the A R Cliffwater Facility Agreement, the Company will purchase such assets owned and held by the applicable Financing Provider under the A R Cliffwater Facility Agreement at a purchase price equal to (i) zero plus (ii) solely to the extent that such unfunded commitment has paid OID, upfront fees or other similar fees, the Additional Consideration, minus (iii) OID, upfront fees and other similar fees on account of such unfunded commitment. The above purchase price calculations are subject to adjustment in certain circumstances under the A R Cliffwater Facility Agreement.

 In connection with investments, including related unfunded commitments, underwritten primarily on investments backed by large and diversified pools of financial hard and contractual assets, or the Warehouse Asset Based Finance Investments, following fulfillment of the conditions precedent to the Company s obligations to purchase any Warehouse Asset Based Finance Investments under the A R Cliffwater Facility Agreement, the Company will purchase such Warehouse Asset Based Finance Investments owned and held by the applicable Financing Provider under the A R Cliffwater Facility Agreement at a purchase price equal to (i) the funded cost of such Warehouse Asset Based Finance Investments, minus (ii) the amount of any PIK interest accrued during the Holding Period, minus (iii) the amount of any OID upfront fees and other similar fees on account of such Warehouse Asset Based Finance Investments during the Holding Period, minus (iv) an amount equal to 11 per annum (or, after the one year anniversary of the date the applicable Financing Provider acquired the Warehouse Asset Based Finance Investments, 12 on the aggregate funded investment cost during the Holding Period of such Warehouse Asset Based Finance Investments, minus, (v) the amount of interest, dividends, fees and other amounts (other than proceeds of principal and other amounts paid on account of indemnification and reimbursement expenses) received by the applicable Financing Provider during the Holding Period on account of such Warehouse Asset Based Finance Investments. This purchase price calculation is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances under the A R Cliffwater Facility Agreement. Except as set forth above, the Company receives all other economics arising before, during and after the Holding Period on such Asset-Based Finance. 
 In the event the settlement date for any purchase by the Company occurs (i) on or before seven business days after the applicable trade date, such date, a Delayed Comp Trigger Date, the above amounts received by the applicable Financing Provider will be extended to the Delayed Comp Trigger Date and (ii) after the seventh business days after the applicable trade date (in the event such purchase has not occurred by way of a participation), the amounts received by the applicable Financing Provider will include the amounts set forth in the foregoing clause (i) through the Delayed Comp Trigger Date and will also include an amount equal to daily simple SOFR plus 11.448 basis points for each day that elapses between the Delayed Comp Trigger Date and the applicable settlement date. The Company will receive all other OID and Fees and all termination fees, prepayment premiums, make-whole or similar fees or payments with respect to such investments. 
 The fair value of the loans under the A R Cliffwater Facility Agreement is not reflected in the purchase price. As such, for loans, to the extent the Company is required to buy a loan from the applicable Financing Provider, the Company bears the risk of the fair value of such loan falling below the par value. In contrast, to the extent that the Company is not required to buy a loan, the applicable Financing Provider bears the risk of the fair value of such loan falling below such par value. Similarly, for unfunded commitments, to the extent the Company is required to buy an unfunded commitment, it will bear the risk of being required to buy a loan that, upon funding, may be valued below the par value. In contrast, to the extent that the Company is not required to buy a loan, the applicable Financing Provider will bear such risk. 
 The portfolio investments expected to be purchased by the Company from time to time pursuant to the A R Cliffwater Facility Agreement are expected to generally consist of directly originated loans to middle-market U.S. companies consistent with the Company s investment objective and investment strategies. There are no material differences between the underwriting standards used in the acquisition of the portfolio investments the Company expects to acquire pursuant to the A R Cliffwater Facility Agreement and the underwriting standards to be employed by the Adviser on the Company s behalf for any other portfolio investments to be acquired or held by the Company from time to time. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the conditions precedent to the Company s obligation to purchase any additional investments from the Financing Provider had not been met. The Company does not hold any beneficial interest in the warehouse. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company purchased investments, including unfunded commitments, with a cost of 204,259 from the Financing Provider. As of September 30, 2024 , 22,051 of these purchases are included in payable for investments purchased in the statement of assets and liabilities. For the period from October 1, 2024 through November 8, 2024 , the Company purchased investments, including unfunded commitments, with a cost of 3,256 from the Financing Provider. 
 As of November 8, 2024 , there were six loans with an aggregate commitment par value of 45,048, inclusive of 9,995 of unfunded commitments, that the Financing Provider purchased and was holding at the Company s request pursuant to the Facility Agreement.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, 91.2 of our portfolio investments (based on fair value) were debt investments paying variable interest rates, 5.8 were debt investments paying fixed interest rates, 1.4 were other income producing investments and the remaining 1.6 consisted of non-income producing investments. A rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher interest rates applicable to any variable rate investments we hold and to declines in the value of any fixed rate investments we hold. However, many of our variable rate investments provide for an interest rate floor, which may prevent our interest income from increasing until benchmark interest rates increase beyond a threshold amount. To the extent that a substantial portion of our investments may be in variable rate investments, an increase in interest rates beyond this threshold would make it easier for us to meet or exceed the hurdle rate applicable to the subordinated incentive fee on income, and may result in a substantial increase in our net investment income and to the amount of incentive fees payable to the Adviser with respect to our increased pre-incentive fee net investment income. A prolonged reduction in interest rates could reduce our gross investment income and could result in a decrease in our net investment income if such decreases in interest rates are not offset by a corresponding increase in the spread over the specified reference rate that we earn on any portfolio investments, a decrease in our operating expenses or a decrease in the interest rate of our floating interest rate liabilities. 
 Pursuant to the terms of the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility and the K-FIT AB-1 Credit Facility, we borrow at a floating rate based on a benchmark interest rate. To the extent that any present or future credit facilities or other financing arrangements that we enter into are based on a floating interest rate, we will be subject to risks relating to changes in market interest rates. In periods of rising interest rates when we have such debt outstanding, or financing arrangements in effect, our interest expense would increase, which could reduce our net investment income, especially to the extent we hold fixed rate investments. 
 The following table shows the effect over a twelve-month period of changes in interest rates on our interest income, interest expense and net interest income assuming no changes in the composition of our investment portfolio, including the accrual status of our investments, and our financing arrangements in effect as of September 30, 2024 (dollar amounts are presented in thousands):

 (2) Assumes current debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024, and no changes over the next twelve months. 
 We expect that our long-term investments will be financed primarily with equity and debt. If deemed prudent, we may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to minimize our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. These techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. Adverse developments resulting from changes in interest rates or hedging transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not engage in interest rate hedging activities. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 From time to time, we may make investments that are denominated in a foreign currency that are subject to the effects of exchange rate movements between the foreign currency of each such investment and the U.S. dollar, which may affect future fair values and cash flows, as well as amounts translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements.

 The table below presents the effect that a 10 immediate, unfavorable change in the foreign currency exchange rates (i.e. strengthening of the U.S. dollar) would have on the fair value of our investments denominated in foreign currencies as of September 30, 2024, by foreign currency, all other valuation assumptions remaining constant. In addition, the table below presents the par value of our investments denominated in foreign currencies and the notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts in local currency in place as of September 30, 2024 to hedge against foreign currency risks.

 (1) Excludes effect, if any, of any foreign currency hedges. 
 As illustrated in the table above, we use derivative instruments from time to time, including foreign currency forward contracts, to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, we have the ability to borrow in foreign currencies under our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility, which provides a natural hedge with regard to changes in exchange rates between the foreign currencies and U.S. dollar and reduces our exposure to foreign exchange rate differences. We are typically a net receiver of these foreign currencies as related for our international investment positions, and, as a result, our investments denominated in foreign currencies, to the extent not hedged, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the net contractual amount of our foreign currency forward contracts totaled 4,860, all of which related to hedging of our foreign currency denominated debt investments. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings denominated in foreign currencies of 6,000 and 11,600 under our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. 
 Based on the foregoing, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that we would meet our disclosure obligations. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 Sales of Unregistered Equity Securities 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we issued and sold an aggregate of 7,562,110 Class I shares pursuant to subscription agreements entered into with participating investors for aggregate consideration of 222.9 million. All offers and sales of Class I shares during the three months ended September 30, 2024 were conducted in connection with the Private Offering in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder. We relied, in part, upon representations from each participating investor in the relevant subscription agreement that such investor is an accredited investor as defined in Regulation D under the Securities Act. 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 Common Shares Discretionary Repurchase Program 
 Beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we have commenced a share repurchase program in which we intend to offer to repurchase, in each quarter, up to 5 of our Common Shares outstanding (either by number of shares or aggregate NAV) as of the close of the previous calendar quarter. The Board may amend or suspend the share repurchase program if in its reasonable judgment it deems such action to be in our best interest and the best interest of our shareholders. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter, such as when a repurchase offer would place an undue burden on our liquidity, adversely affect our operations or risk having an adverse impact on the Company that would outweigh the benefit of the repurchase offer. We intend to conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Exchange Act and the 1940 Act. 
 Under our share repurchase program, to the extent we offer to repurchase shares in any particular quarter, we expect to repurchase shares pursuant to quarterly tender offers using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the Valuation Date, which will be the last calendar day of the applicable quarter. Shareholders should keep in mind that if they tender Common Shares in a tender offer with a Valuation Date that is within the 12-month period following the initial issue date of their tendered Common Shares, the Company may repurchase such Common Shares subject to the 2 Early Repurchase Deduction. The Early Repurchase Deduction will be retained by the Company for the benefit of remaining holders of Common Shares. This Early Repurchase Deduction will also generally apply to minimum account repurchases. 
 Shareholders may tender all of the Common Shares that they own in connection with any of our quarterly tender offers. In the event the amount of shares tendered exceeds the repurchase offer amount, shares will be repurchased on a pro rata basis. All unsatisfied repurchase requests must be resubmitted in the next quarterly tender offer, or upon the recommencement of the share repurchase program, as applicable. We will have no obligation to repurchase shares, including if the repurchase would violate the restrictions on distributions under federal law or Delaware law. The limitations and restrictions described above may prevent us from accommodating all repurchase requests made in any quarter. Our share repurchase program has many limitations, including the limitations described above, and should not in any way be viewed as the equivalent of a secondary market. We will offer to repurchase shares on such terms as may be determined by the Board in its complete and absolute discretion unless, in the judgment of the Board, such repurchases would not be in the best interests of our shareholders or would violate applicable law. There is no assurance that the Board will exercise its discretion to offer to repurchase shares or that there will be sufficient funds available to accommodate all of our shareholders requests for repurchase. As a result, we may repurchase less than the full amount of shares that a shareholder requests to have repurchased. If we do not repurchase the full amount of shares that a shareholder has requested to be repurchased, or we 
 59

 determine not to make repurchases of our shares, such shareholder will likely not be able to dispose of its shares, even if we under-perform. Any periodic repurchase offers will be subject in part to our available cash and compliance with the RIC qualification and diversification rules and the 1940 Act. Repurchases of shares from shareholders by the Company will be paid in cash within 65 days of the expiration of the applicable tender offer, after the determination of the relevant NAV per share is finalized. Repurchases will be effective after receipt and acceptance by the Company of eligible written tenders of shares from shareholders by the applicable repurchase offer deadline. 
 On September 3, 2024, we commenced a tender offer (the September 2024 Tender Offer pursuant to which we offered to repurchase up to 662,765 Common Shares tendered prior to 11:59 p.m., E.T. on September 30, 2024 (the September 2024 Tender Offer Expiration Date ). There were no Common Shares validly tendered by shareholders prior to the September 2024 Tender Offer Expiration Date.
