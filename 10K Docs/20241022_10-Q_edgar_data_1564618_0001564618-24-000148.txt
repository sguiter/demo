 The consolidated interim financial statements are unaudited, but include all adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results of the periods presented. All such adjustments were of a normal and recurring nature.

 impairment charge for the period. 
 Throughout the second quarter 2024, the Company's stock price continued to trade below book value. In May 2024, in connection with the announcement of the proposed merger with and into SSB as described above, the Company entered into a definitive agreement on May 17, 2024 whereby the implied consideration of the merger transaction was less than the Company's book value. The Company determined such events indicated that goodwill related to its single reporting unit may be impaired and resulted in the Company performing interim goodwill impairment assessments during the second quarter of 2024. The Company determined the estimated fair market value of the reporting unit was equal to the implied valuation of the merger transaction based upon the conversion ratio to SSB s stock price as of the measurement date, and as such, the Company recorded in goodwill impairment charges during second quarter 2024 as the estimated fair value of equity was less than its book value. This was a non-cash charge to earnings and had no impact on the Company's regulatory capital ratios, cash flows, or liquidity position. 
 During the third quarter 2024, market conditions in the industry stabilized and stock values for both SSB and the Company increased resulting in the Company's implied value, as noted above, exceeding its book value as of September 30, 2024, and indicating no further decline in value that would trigger an interim assessment or additional impairment charge. 
 Goodwill impairment charge ) Balance, September 30, 2024 
 Management will continue to evaluate the Company's carrying value, as well as economic conditions at future reporting periods for further decline.

 allowance for credit losses on available for sale securities recognized as of September 30, 2024. 
 The Company's held to maturity securities include taxable and tax-exempt municipal securities issued primarily by school districts but also may include utility districts or other municipalities. With regard to securities issued by state and municipal subdivisions, management considers issuer bond ratings, historical loss rates for given bond ratings, whether issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of the securities, internal forecasts and whether or not such securities are guaranteed. Substantially all of the Company's held to maturity securities are guaranteed by the Texas Permanent School Fund (PSF), which is a sovereign wealth fund that serves to provide revenues for funding of public primary and secondary education in the State of Texas. At September 30, 2024, all of the Company's held to maturity securities were rated AAA/Aaa by Moody's and/or Standard Poor's bond rating services. Furthermore, as of September 30, 2024, there were no past due principal or interest payments associated with these securities. As such, allowance for credit losses has been recorded on held to maturity securities as of September 30, 2024.

 and , of energy related loans outstanding, respectively. 
 The Company has a mortgage warehouse purchase program providing mortgage inventory financing for residential mortgage loans originated by mortgage banker clients across a broad geographic scale. Proceeds from the sale of mortgages is the primary source of repayment for warehouse inventory financing via approved investor takeout commitments. These loans typically have a very short duration ranging between a few days to days. In some cases, loans to larger mortgage originators may be financed for up to days. Warehouse purchase program loans are collectively evaluated for impairment and are purchased under several contractual requirements, providing safeguards to the Company. To date, the Company has not experienced a loss on these loans and allowance for credit losses has been allocated to them. 
 Commercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial loans. These loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts, and the repayment of these loans is generally largely dependent on the successful operation of the property or the business conducted on the property securing the loan. Commercial real estate loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. The properties securing the Company s commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location as well as granularity with moderate average loan sizes. Management monitors the diversification of the portfolio on a quarterly basis by type and geographic location. Management also tracks the level of owner occupied property versus non-owner occupied property. At September 30, 2024, the portfolio consisted of approximately of owner occupied property. 
 Land and commercial land development loans are underwritten using feasibility studies, independent appraisal reviews and financial analysis of the developers or property owners. Generally, borrowers must have a proven track record of success. Commercial construction loans are generally based upon estimates of cost and value of the completed project. These estimates may not be accurate. Commercial construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with the repayment dependent on the success of the ultimate project. Sources of repayment for these loans may be pre-committed permanent financing or sale of the developed property. The loans in this portfolio are geographically diverse and due to the increased risk are monitored closely by management and the board of directors on a quarterly basis. 
 Residential real estate and single-family interim construction loans are underwritten primarily based on borrowers documented income and ability to repay the Bank and other creditors as well as minimum collateral values and credit scores. Relatively small loan amounts are spread across many individual borrowers, which minimizes risk in the residential portfolio. In addition, management evaluates trends in past dues and current economic factors on a regular basis.

 and have amortization periods limited to . Agricultural non-real estate loans are generally comprised of term loans to fund the purchase of equipment, livestock and seasonal operating lines to grain farmers to plant and harvest corn and soybeans. Specific underwriting standards have been established for agricultural-related loans including the establishment of projections for each operating year based on industry developed estimates of farm input costs and expected commodity yields and prices. Operating lines are typically written for and secured by the crop and other farm assets as considered necessary. 
 Agricultural loans carry credit risks as they involve larger balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, repayment of such loans depends on the successful operation or management of the farm property securing the loan or for which an operating loan is utilized. Farming operations may be affected by adverse weather conditions such as drought, hail or floods that can severely limit crop yields. 
 Consumer loans represent less than of the outstanding total loan portfolio. Collateral consists primarily of automobiles and other personal assets. Credit score analysis is used to supplement the underwriting process. 
 Most of the Company s lending activity occurs within the state of Texas, primarily in the north, central and southeast Texas regions and the state of Colorado, specifically along the Front Range area. As of September 30, 2024, loans in the North Texas region represented about of the total portfolio, followed by the Colorado Front Range region at about , the Houston region at and the Central Texas region at . A large percentage of the Company s portfolio consists of commercial and residential real estate loans. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no concentrations of loans related to a single industry in excess of 10 of total loans. 
 Under ASC 326, the allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. Loans, or portions thereof, are charged-off against the allowance when they are deemed uncollectible. Recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off. The amount of the allowance represents management's best estimate of current expected credit losses on loans considering available information relevant to assessing collectibility over the loans' contractual terms, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals and modifications unless the extension or renewal options are included in the borrower contract and are not unconditionally cancellable by the Company.

 Loans exhibiting unique risk characteristics and requiring an individual evaluation are measured based on 1) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate; 2) the loan's observable market price; or 3) the fair value of collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. The majority of the Company s individually evaluated loans are measured at the fair value of the collateral. 
 Management continually evaluates the allowance for credit losses based upon the factors noted above. Should any of the factors considered by management change, the Company s estimate of credit losses could also change and would affect the level of future provision for credit losses. Portions of the allowance may be allocated for specific credits; however, the entire allowance is available for any credit that, in management s judgment, should be charged-off. While the calculation of the allowance for credit losses utilizes management s best judgment and all the information available, the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is dependent on a variety of factors beyond the Company s control, including, among other things, the performance of the entire loan portfolio, the economy, changes in interest rates and the view of regulatory authorities towards loan classifications. 
 Loans requiring an individual evaluation are generally identified at the servicing officer level based on review of weekly past due reports and/or the loan officer s communication with borrowers. In addition, the status of past due loans are routinely discussed within each lending region as well as credit committee meetings to determine if classification is warranted. The Company s internal loan review department has implemented an internal risk-based loan review process to identify potential internally classified loans that supplements the independent external loan review. Independent loan reviews cover a wide range of the loan portfolio, including large lending relationships, specifically targeted loan types, and if applicable recently acquired loan portfolios. These reviews include analysis of borrower s financial condition, payment histories, review of loan documentation and collateral values to determine if a loan should be internally classified. Generally, once classified, an analysis is completed by the credit department to determine the amount of allocated allowance for credit loss required. Expected credit losses for collateral dependent loans, including loans where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty but foreclosure is not probable, are based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date, adjusted for selling costs as appropriate.

 Effective tax rate ) 
 The effective tax rates for 2024 and 2023 differ from the statutory federal tax rate of 21 largely due to tax exempt interest income earned on certain investment securities and loans, the nontaxable earnings on bank owned life insurance, nondeductible compensation, and state income tax. The effective rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also reflects nondeductible acquisition-related expenses as well as goodwill impairment charges resulting in the negative effective tax rates for the period. The effective rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is lower due to the litigation settlement that occurred in first quarter 2023.

From time to time, the Company also realizes gains or losses on the sale of assets. The Company s principal expenses include interest expense on interest-bearing customer deposits, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas (FHLB) and other borrowings, operating expenses such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy costs, communication and technology costs, expenses associated with other real estate owned, other administrative expenses, amortization of intangibles, provisions for credit losses and the Company s assessment for FDIC deposit insurance. 

Recent Developments 
 Pending Acquisition 
 As described in Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 12. Business Combination in the Company's consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report, the Company and SSB have entered into a definitive agreement, dated May 17, 2024, providing that, among other things and on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, SSB will acquire the Company in an all-stock transaction by means of a merger of the Company with and into SSB with SSB surviving the merger. The Company's shareholders will receive 0.60 shares of SSB's common stock for each share of Company common stock based on a fixed exchange ratio. The merger has been approved by the Boards of Directors and shareholders of both companies and is expected to close during the first quarter of 2025, although delays may occur. The transaction is subject to certain conditions, including customary regulatory approvals. Merger expenses of 460 thousand and 2.8 million have been incurred for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Additional merger expenses are expected to be incurred for the remainder of 2024. 
 Goodwill Impairment Charge 
 As described in Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , as a result of entering into a merger agreement with SSB and due to the Company's stock price trading below book value, the Company recorded a 518.0 million goodwill impairment charge in second quarter 2024, which is included in noninterest expense in the consolidated financial statements. This impairment charge has negatively affected the Company's earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reducing net income by 516.8 million (after tax) or 12.49 per diluted share. 

Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 The following discussion and analysis of the Company's results of operations compares the operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 with the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be expected for all of the year ending December 31, 2024. 
 Results of Operations 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a net income of 20.4 million 0.49 per common share on a diluted basis) compared with net income of 32.8 million 0.79 per common share on a diluted basis) for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company posted annualized returns on average equity of 4.24 and 5.51 , returns on average assets of 0.44 and 0.70 and efficiency ratios of 72.32 and 63.75 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing total noninterest expense (which excludes the provision for credit losses and the amortization of other intangible assets) by net interest income plus noninterest income.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net loss was 448.9 million (10.85) per common share on a diluted basis) compared with net income of 28.3 million 0.69 per common share on a diluted basis) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company posted annualized returns on average equity of (27.34) and 1.60 , returns on average assets of (3.21) and 0.21 and efficiency ratios of 218.83 and 88.75 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Net Interest Income 
 The Company s net interest income is its interest income, net of interest expenses. Changes in the balances of the Company s interest-earning assets and its interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in the market interest rates, affect the Company s net interest income. The difference between the Company s average yield on earning assets and its average rate paid for interest-bearing liabilities is its net interest spread. Noninterest-bearing sources of funds, such as demand deposits and stockholders equity, also support the Company s earning assets. The impact of the noninterest-bearing sources of funds is reflected in the Company s net interest margin, which is calculated as annualized net interest income divided by average earning assets. 
 Net interest income was 106.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 2.2 million, or 2.0 , from 109.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to the increased funding costs on our deposit products offset to a lesser extent by increased earnings on average loan balances. Average interest-earning assets increased 349.9 million or 2.1 , to 17.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 16.7 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to higher average loan balances, which increased approximately 369.4 million, due to organic growth primarily occurring during the second half of 2023 as well as an increase in interest-bearing cash balances of 88.3 million offset by a decrease in average securities of 107.8 million. The yield on average interest-earning assets increased 34 basis points from 5.31 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 5.65 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in asset yield from the prior year is primarily a result of increases in the benchmark rates over the last year. The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 44 basis points to 4.16 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.72 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is reflective of higher funding costs, primarily on deposit products as a result of Fed Funds rate increases in 2023, offset by decreased costs on FHLB advances, primarily due to lower holdings based on liquidity needs resulting in a shift in funding sources for the year-over-year period. Also contributing was the shift from non-interest bearing deposits into interest-bearing products during the year-over-year period. The aforementioned changes resulted in a 10 basis point decrease in the net interest margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 at 2.50 compared to 2.60 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net interest income was 315.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 35.6 million, or 10.1 , from 350.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by the increased funding costs on our deposit products as a result of the multiple Fed rate increases in 2023 offset to a lesser extent by increased earnings on interest-earning assets, primarily average loans. Average interest-earning assets increased 455.8 million or 2.7 , to 17.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 16.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was driven by increases in average loan balances of 552.1 million due to organic growth occurring in the second half of 2023 as well as an increase in average interest-bearing cash balances of 5.3 million offset by a decrease in average securities balances of 101.6 million. The average yield on interest-earning assets increased 46 basis points from 5.14 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 5.60 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 while the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased 88 basis points from 3.26 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.14 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 35 basis points to 2.47 compared to 2.82 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to increased funding costs on deposits resulting from Fed rate increases during 2023 as well as shift from lower rate short-term borrowings to higher rate long-term borrowings, offset by higher earnings on loans due to organic growth occurring in the last half of 2023.

 Provision for Credit Losses 
 The measurement of expected credit losses under the Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) methodology is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost. Provision for credit losses is determined by management as the amount to be added (subtracted) to the allowance for credit loss accounts for various types of financial instruments including loans, held to maturity debt securities and off-balance sheet credit exposure, after net charge-offs have been deducted, to bring the allowance to a level deemed appropriate by management to absorb expected credit losses over the lives of the respective financial instruments. Management actively monitors the Company s asset quality and provides appropriate provisions based on such factors as historical loss experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. 
 Financial instruments are charged-off against the allowance for credit losses when appropriate. Although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the provision for credit losses, future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ from the assumptions used in making the determination. 
 The following table presents the components of provision for credit losses: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Provision for credit losses related to: Loans 4,853 882 2,013 229 Held to maturity securities Off-balance sheet credit exposures (153) (542) (513) 421 Total provision for credit losses 4,700 340 1,500 650 
 Provision expense for loans is generally reflective of organic loan growth or decline as well as charge-offs or specific reserves taken during the respective period. Provision expense is also impacted by the economic outlook and changes in macroeconomic variables. The provision expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to an increase in credit allocations on evaluated loans during the quarter. 
 As fully discussed in Note 3. Securities , the majority of securities in the held to maturity portfolio are guaranteed and highly rated by bond rating services. Therefore, there was no provision for credit losses on held to maturity securities recorded during the respective periods. 
 Changes in the allowance for unfunded commitments are generally driven by the remaining unfunded amount and the expected utilization rate of a given loan segment.

 Total noninterest income decreased 185 thousand, or 1.4 and 731 thousand, or 1.8 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 over same periods in 2023, respectively. Significant changes in the components of noninterest income are discussed below. 
 Investment management fees. Investment management fees increased 295 thousand, or 11.9 and 1.0 million, or 14.0 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023, respectively. The increases were due to higher managed asset balances due to improvement in market conditions over the year. 
 Mortgage banking revenue. Mortgage banking revenue decreased 92 thousand, or 5.2 and 789 thousand, or 14.0 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023, respectively. The decreases were primarily due to lower volumes and margins resulting from higher interest rates for the year-over-year period. 
 Other noninterest income. Other noninterest income decreased 740 thousand, or 19.1 and 2.0 million, or 17.7 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023, respectively. Other noninterest income was lower for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to decreases in various types of miscellaneous income. In addition, the nine month period ended September 30, 2023 also reflects a 318 thousand BOLI benefit claim that occurred in early 2023.

 Noninterest expense increased 8.6 million, or 10.5 and increased 428.9 million, or 120.3 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, respectively. The significant change in the components of noninterest expense is discussed below. 
 Salaries and employee benefits. Salaries and employee benefits increased 6.4 million, or 14.7 and 9.6 million, or 7.0 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, respectively. The increase for the three and nine month period was primarily due to 5.1 million and 7.7 million, respectively in higher incentive and equity award expense and decreases of 774 thousand and 1.3 million in deferred salaries contra expense due to lower loan originations over the periods. The nine month period also reflected higher salaries expense of 1.1 million offset by 703 thousand in lower contract labor costs compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 Communications and technology. Communications and technology increased 1.0 million, or 14.8 and 2.1 million, or 9.9 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily due to software cost increases among various technology and information security vendors. 
 FDIC assessment. FDIC assessment increased 543 thousand, or 14.9 and increased 3.0 million, or 29.3 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, respectively. The increase for the three and nine months reflects overall increases in the assessment rates, including the impact from the Company's current year loss position, while the year-over-year change was also impacted by a 1.2 million special assessment assessed to recover uninsured deposit losses related to 2023 bank failures. 
 Litigation settlement. Litigation settlement of 102.5 million was recognized in the first quarter 2023 due to the settlement of the ongoing litigation that was acquired by the Company in 2014. Refer to Note 6. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Commitments and Contingencies for more information.

 Professional fees. Professional fees increased 34 thousand, or 2.7 and decreased 1.7 million, or 27.9 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, respectively. The decrease for the nine month period was due primarily to lower consulting fees of 1.2 million due to less active projects. 
 Acquisition expense, including legal. Acquisition expense, including legal increased 460 thousand and 2.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, respectively. The increase is related to the pending merger with SSB that was announced in the second quarter 2024. 
 Goodwill impairment. Goodwill impairment of 518.0 million was recognized in the second quarter 2024 triggered by the Company entering into a merger agreement with SSB as well as the Company's stock price trading below book value, as discussed elsewhere in this report. 
 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Income tax expense was 5.3 million and 16.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to income tax expense of 8.2 million and 5.7 million for the same periods in 2023, respectively. The effective tax rates were 20.5 and (3.9) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 20.1 and 16.7 for the same periods in 2023, respectively. The effective rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was negative primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge, of which 512.4 million is not deductible for tax purposes. The lower effective rate for nine months ended September 30, 2023 is due to the settlement of the Stanford litigation in first quarter 2023. 

Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition 
 The following discussion and analysis summarizes the financial condition of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and details certain changes between those periods. 
 Assets 
 The Company s total assets decreased by 452.0 million, or 2.4 , to 18.6 billion as of September 30, 2024 from 19.0 billion at December 31, 2023. The decrease is mainly due to a decrease in goodwill as a result of the impairment charge, as well as decreases in loans and available for sale securities during the period offset by increases in cash and cash equivalents.

 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company's loan portfolio, before the allowance for credit losses, totaled 14.3 billion and 14.7 billion, respectively, which is a decrease of 2.9 between the two periods. Loans held for investment, excluding mortgage warehouse purchase loans and loans held for sale, decreased 264.9 million, or 2.5 annualized for the nine month period. See Note 4. Loans, Net and Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans for more details on the Company's loan portfolio. 
 Commercial real estate (CRE) loans Concentration . The commercial real estate loan portfolio has historically been the Company's largest category of loans, representing 58.2 and 56.3 of the total loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Non-Owner Occupied CRE represents 6.5 billion, or 78.7 of total CRE and 45.7 of the total loan portfolio, and 6.5 billion, or 78.7 of total CRE and 44.3 of the total portfolio, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company expects that commercial real estate loans will continue to be a significant portion of the Company s total loan portfolio. 
 Commercial real estate loans are subject to a varying degree of risk associated with changing general economic conditions. The Company employs heightened risk management practices that address key elements, including board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support commercial real estate lending. 
 Despite the Company's concentration in CRE, the properties securing this portfolio are diversified in terms of type and geographic location. This diversity helps reduce the exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single market or industry. As a matter of policy, the CRE portfolio is subject to risk exposure limits by individual asset classes as well as geographic collateral locations outside of our market areas. We regularly identify and assess concentration levels through ongoing reporting to our Board of Directors as well as committees at both the Board and Management levels. Credit underwriting standards are periodically reviewed and adjusted based upon observations from our ongoing monitoring of economic conditions in major real estate markets in which we lend. In response to the current dynamic interest rate environment and 2023 increases in the benchmark rates that determine loan pricing, the Company has enhanced its stress testing and loan review activities to mitigate interest rate reset risk with a specific emphasis on borrowers abilities to absorb the impact of higher interest loan rates.

 Asset Quality 
 Nonperforming Assets. The Company has established procedures to assist the Company in maintaining the overall quality of the Company s loan portfolio. In addition, the Company has adopted underwriting guidelines to be followed by the Company s lending officers and require significant senior management review of proposed extensions of credit exceeding certain thresholds. When delinquencies exist, the Company rigorously monitors the levels of such delinquencies for any negative or adverse trends. The Company s loan review procedures include approval of lending policies and underwriting guidelines by the Company s board of directors, ongoing risk-based independent internal and external loan reviews, approval of large credit relationships by the Bank s Executive Loan Committee and loan quality documentation procedures. The Company, like other financial institutions, is subject to the risk that its loan portfolio will be subject to increasing pressures from deteriorating borrower credit due to general economic conditions. 
 The Company classifies nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans, including nonaccrual loans and loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest, as well as other real estate owned and other repossessed assets. Further information regarding the Company's accounting policies related to past due loans, nonaccrual loans, collateral dependent loans and loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is presented in Note 4. Loans, Net and Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans .

 Nonaccrual loans increased to 55.9 million as of September 30, 2024 from 50.3 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase in nonaccrual loans was primarily due to the addition of a commercial loan relationship totaling 2.0 million and two commercial real estate loans totaling 4.3 million offset by paydowns on various loans. 
 Other real estate owned and other repossessed assets decreased from 9.6 million as of December 31, 2023 to 8.8 million as of September 30, 2024 due to the sale of an 805 thousand other real estate property during the period.

 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The measurement of expected credit losses under CECL methodology is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables, held to maturity debt securities and off-balance sheet credit exposures. The CECL model requires the measurement of all expected credit losses on applicable financial assets based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. While historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfolio-specific risk characteristics, environmental conditions or other relevant factors. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of the allowance accounts is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond the Company's control, including the performance of the portfolios, the economy, changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward classification of assets. For additional information regarding our accounting policies related to credit losses, refer to Note 4. Loans, Net and Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. 
 The economy and other risk factors are minimized by the Company s underwriting standards which include the following principles: 1) financial strength of the borrower including strong earnings, high net worth, significant liquidity and acceptable debt to worth ratio, 2) managerial business competence, 3) ability to repay, 4) loan to value, 5) projected cash flow and 6) guarantor financial statements as applicable.

 ____________ 
 (1) Represents the percentage of the Company s total loans included in each loan category. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses on loans amounted to 150.3 million, or 1.08 , of total loans held for investment, excluding mortgage warehouse purchase loans, compared with 151.9 million, or 1.07 , as of December 31, 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had specific credit loss allocations of 20.3 million on individually evaluated loans totaling 53.8 million, compared with specific credit loss allocations of 15.2 million on individually evaluated loans totaling 47.3 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase in individually evaluated loans and specific credit loss allocations was due to the additions of a commercial loan relationship totaling 2.0 million with a specific credit loss allocation of 559 thousand and two commercial real estate loans totaling 4.3 million with specific credit allocations of 466 thousand. In addition, there was an increase of 4.3 million in specific credit losses on a existing individually evaluated commercial loan relationship.

Table of Contents 

 The factors driving significant changes in credit loss allocations by segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are discussed below. 
 The allowance allocated to commercial loans totaled 34.8 million, or 1.6 of total commercial loans as of September 30, 2024, compared to 34.8 million, or 1.5 of commercial loans as of December 31, 2023. Modeled expected credit losses decreased 4.8 million due to changes in the economic forecast, specifically the improvement to the national housing price index (HPI). Specific allocations for commercial loans that were evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis increased 4.8 million from 11.7 million at December 31, 2023 to 16.5 million at September 30, 2024 due primarily to the increase in specific allocations on the commercial relationship discussed above. 
 The allowance allocated to commercial real estate loans totaled 69.6 million, or 0.8 of total commercial real estate loans as of September 30, 2024, compared to 60.1 million, or 0.7 of commercial real estate loans as of December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses increased 9.5 million, or 15.9 over the year. Modeled expected credit losses increased 40 thousand, while qualitative factors increased 9.3 million. The increase in qualitative factors was due to elevated risk-grade credits and past due trends. Specific allocations for commercial real estate loans that were evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis increased 224 thousand from 3.6 million at December 31, 2023 to 3.8 million at September 30, 2024. 
 The allowance allocated to construction, land and land development loans totaled 22.4 million, or 2.0 of total construction, land and land development loans as of September 30, 2024, compared to 31.5 million, or 2.6 of construction, land and land development loans as of December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses decreased 9.1 million, or 29.0 for the period. Modeled expected credit losses decreased 12.6 million, while qualitative adjustments increased 3.4 million. The decrease in modeled losses was a result of improvements in the national housing price index (HPI) along with an upward adjustment to the income index and downward adjustment to the 3-Month T-Bill in addition to the decrease in loan balances in this portfolio segment. The increase in qualitative factors was primarily due to an increase in risk level and elevated past due loans in the segment. There were no specific allocations for construction, land and land development loans that were evaluated for expected credit losses on a individual basis at December 31, 2023 or September 30, 2024. 
 The allowance allocated to residential real estate loans totaled 10.9 million, or 0.6 of total residential real estate loans as of September 30, 2024, compared to 6.9 million, or 0.4 of residential real estate loans as of December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses increased 4.0 million, or 57.9 for the period. Modeled expected credit losses increased 1.1 million while qualitative factors related to residential real estate loans increased 2.9 million. The increase in modeled losses was primarily related to changes in the economic forecast. The increase in qualitative factors was due primarily to an increase in risk level and elevated past due loans in the segment. There were no specific allocations for residential real estate loans that were evaluated for expected credit losses on a individual basis at December 31, 2023 or September 30, 2024. 
 The allowance allocated to single-family interim construction loans totaled 11.6 million, or 2.7 of total single-family interim construction loans as of September 30, 2024, compared to 17.4 million, or 3.4 of single-family interim construction loans as of December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses decreased 5.8 million, or 33.5 for the period due to decreased modeled expected credit losses of 7.1 million offset by a 1.3 million increase in qualitative factors. The decrease in modeled losses was primarily related to improvements in the housing price index used in the calculation in addition to the decrease in loan balances in this portfolio segment. The increase in qualitative factors was due to an elevated level of past due loans in the segment. There were no specific allocations for single-family interim construction loans that were evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis at December 31, 2023 or September 30, 2024. 
 Refer to Note 4. Loans, Net and Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans , in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional details of the allowance for credit losses on loans.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net charge-offs totaled 3.6 million, which is 0.03 (annualized) of the Company's average loans outstanding during the period, compared to net charge-offs of 767 thousand, or 0.01 (annualized) of average loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The majority of the 2024 charge-offs were due to a single-family interim construction loan relationship that was partially charged down 2.6 million during foreclosure and subsequently sold during the second quarter. Additionally, one commercial loan relationship totaling 906 thousand was charged-off during the period. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses - Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures 
 The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is calculated under the CECL model, representing expected credit losses over the contractual period for which the Company is exposed to credit risk resulting from a contractual obligation to extend credit. Off-balance sheet credit exposures primarily consist of amounts available under outstanding lines of credit and letters of credit detailed in Note 6. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Commitments and Contingencies . The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is estimated by loan segment at each balance sheet date using the same methodologies as portfolio loans, taking into consideration the likelihood that funding will occur based on historical utilization rates. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures was 3.4 million and 3.9 million, respectively.

 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 Cash and cash equivalents increased by 626.1 million, or 86.7 to 1.3 billion at September 30, 2024 from 722.0 million at December 31, 2023. Cash and cash equivalent balances can vary due to cash needs and volatility of commercial accounts. In addition, the increase in balances as of September 30, 2024 is primarily due to an increased liquidity position due to lower loan demand during the period. 
 Securities 
 The Company s investment strategy aims to maximize earnings while maintaining liquidity in securities with minimal credit, interest rate and duration risk. The types and maturities of securities purchased are primarily based on the Company s current and projected liquidity and interest rate sensitivity positions. Refer to Note 3. Securities for more details on the Company's security portfolio. 
 The fair value of the Company's available for sale securities decreased 83.2 million, or 5.2 , to 1.5 billion at September 30, 2024 from 1.6 billion at December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to net paydowns, maturities and calls during the year offset by a decrease of 45.2 million in total unrealized losses due to improvement in market conditions. The amortized cost of held to maturity securities decreased 1.4 million, or 0.7 , to 203.9 million as of September 30, 2024 from 205.2 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 Total securities represented 9.2 and 9.5 of the Company s total assets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 There were no sales of securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. 
 Certain investment securities are valued at less than their amortized cost. At September 30, 2024, the Company's review of all securities at an unrealized loss position determined that the losses resulted from factors not related to credit quality. This conclusion is based on the Company's analysis of the underlying risk characteristics, including credit ratings, and other qualitative factors for each security type in the portfolio. The unrealized losses are generally due to increases in market interest rates. Furthermore, the Company has the intent to hold these securities until maturity or a forecasted recovery, and it is more likely than not that the Company will not have to sell the securities before the recovery of their cost basis. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date. As such, there is no allowance for credit losses on available for sale or held to maturity securities recognized as of September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 3. Securities for more information on the Company's analysis of credit losses on securities available for sale and held to maturity. 
 Goodwill 
 Goodwill decreased 518.0 million, or 52.1 , to 476.0 million as of September 30, 2024 from 994.0 million as of December 31, 2023 due to an impairment charge taken during the second quarter, as discussed elsewhere in this report. 
 Liabilities 
 The Company s total liabilities increased minimally by 1.7 million, and totaled 16.6 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 with significant components discussed below. 
 Deposits 
 Total deposits increased 272.0 million, or 1.7 , to 16.0 billion as of September 30, 2024 to 15.7 billion as of December 31, 2023. A shift from non-interest bearing deposits to interest-bearing deposits continued during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Brokered deposits decreased to 2.2 billion at September 30, 2024 from 2.5 billion at December 31, 2023. Estimated uninsured deposits, excluding public funds deposits, totaled 5.0 billion, or 31.3 of total deposits as of September 30, 2024.

 FHLB Advances 
 FHLB advances decreased 350.0 million, or 100.0 , to zero at September 30, 2024 from 350.0 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease was due to an improved liquidity position and replacing short-term FHLB advances with BTFP advances as a lower cost alternative. 
 Other Borrowings 
 Other borrowings increased 182.9 million, or 67.3 , to 454.8 million at September 30, 2024 from 271.8 million at December 31, 2023. The increase is mainly due to the issuance of 175.0 million subordinated debentures (net of 3.8 origination costs) and an advance of 155.0 million from the BTFP offset by the redemption of 110.0 million subordinated debentures and repayment of 33.8 million on the Company's unsecured line of credit. 
 Other Liabilities 
 Other liabilities decreased 103.4 million, or 44.4 , to 129.7 million at September 30, 2024 from 233.0 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to payment of the 100.0 million legal settlement during second quarter that was previously accrued at December 31, 2023. 
 Capital Resources and Liquidity Management 
 Capital Resources 
 The Company s stockholders equity is influenced by the Company s earnings, common stock repurchased by the Company, common stock granted and forfeited, stock based compensation expense, the dividends the Company pays on its common stock, and any changes in other comprehensive income relating to available for sale securities and cash flow hedges. 
 Total stockholders' equity was 1.9 billion at September 30, 2024, a decrease of approximately 453.7 million from December 31, 2023. The net decrease was a result of a net loss of 448.9 million, dividends paid of 47.3 million and common stock repurchased of 2.9 million offset by a decrease of 37.9 million in other comprehensive losses and stock based compensation of 7.5 million. 
 Regulatory Capital Requirements 
 The Company s capital management consists of providing equity to support the Company s current and future operations. The Company is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by state and federal banking agencies, including the TDB, Federal Reserve and the FDIC. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements may prompt certain actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and results of operations. Please refer to Note 11. Regulatory Matters , in the notes to the Company's audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional details. 
 Liquidity Management 
 Liquidity refers to the measure of the Company s ability to meet current and future cash flow requirements as they become due, while at the same time meeting the Company s operating, capital and strategic cash flow needs, all at a reasonable cost. The Company's Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) is responsible for the oversight of liquidity. ALCO is a management subcommittee of the Board Risk Oversight Committee. The Company utilizes its Liquidity Risk Management Policy, Contingency Funding Plan (CFP), and Liquidity Risk Management Framework to monitor and manage liquidity risk. The Policy establishes liquidity monitoring ratios and their respective limits. The CFP identifies Key Risk Indicators and defines triggers to determine the level of risk on a sliding scale: Normal, Early Warning, Advanced Warning, and Crisis. The CFP further outlines appropriate action steps to be taken by management to remedy an increase in liquidity risk based on the level of risk determined in the framework. Additionally, the CFP outlines appropriate additional monitoring, reporting, and communication for each level of risk within the framework.

 The Company s asset and liability management policy is intended to maintain adequate liquidity and, therefore, enhance the Company s ability to raise funds to support asset growth, meet deposit withdrawals and lending needs, maintain reserve requirements, and otherwise sustain operations. The Company accomplishes this through management of the maturities of its interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The Company believes that its present position is adequate to meet the current and future liquidity needs. 
 The Company continuously monitors its liquidity position to ensure that assets and liabilities are managed in a manner that will meet all of the Company s short-term and long-term cash requirements. The Company manages its liquidity position to meet the daily cash flow needs of customers, while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to meet the return on investment objectives of the Company s shareholders. The Company also monitors its liquidity requirements in light of interest rate trends, changes in the economy and the scheduled maturity and interest rate sensitivity of the investment and loan portfolios and deposits. 
 Liquidity risk management is an important element in the Company s asset/liability management process. The Company's liquidity position is continuously monitored and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate. The Company s short-term and long-term liquidity requirements are primarily to fund on-going operations, including payment of interest on deposits and debt, extensions of credit to borrowers, capital expenditures and shareholder dividends. These liquidity requirements are met primarily through cash flow from operations, redeployment of pre-paid and maturing balances in the Company s loan and investment portfolios, debt financing and increases in customer deposits. The Company s liquidity position is supported by management of liquid assets and liabilities and access to alternative sources of funds. Liquid assets include cash, interest-bearing deposits in banks, federal funds sold, securities available for sale and maturing or prepaying balances in the Company s investment and loan portfolios. Liquid liabilities include core deposits, brokered deposits, federal funds purchased and other borrowings. Other sources of liquidity include the sale of loans, the issuance of additional collateralized borrowings such as FHLB advances, the issuance of debt securities, borrowings through the Federal Reserve s discount window and the Bank Term Funding Program through the program's expiration date and the issuance of equity securities. In addition to the liquidity provided by the sources described above, the Company maintains correspondent relationships with other banks in order to sell loans or purchase overnight funds should additional liquidity be needed. The Company's 100.0 million line of credit also provides an additional source of liquidity. As of October 21, 2024, the Company had no outstanding borrowings against this line of credit. For additional information regarding the Company s operating, investing and financing cash flows, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows provided in the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 Deposits represent the Company s primary source of funds. The Company continues to focus on growing core deposits through the Company s relationship driven banking philosophy and community-focused marketing programs. As needed from time to time, the Company may engage in wholesale funding through brokered deposits to enhance its liquidity position. To avoid concentrations with any one broker, brokered deposits can be accessed from a variety of brokers acting as intermediaries, typically larger money-center financial institutions as well as broker networks including Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (CDARS), IntraFi Cash Service (ICS) Total Bank Solutions (TBS) among other sources. During 2023, the Company increased the use of higher-cost brokered deposits to secure additional liquidity due to the competitive deposit environment resulting from the interest rate increases over the year. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, wholesale brokered funding has decreased as core deposits have stabilized. 
 The following table summarizes the Company s short-term borrowing capacities net of balances outstanding as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands): 
 Unsecured fed funds lines available from commercial banks 405,000 American Financial Exchange (overnight borrowings) 374,000 Unused borrowing capacity from FHLB 4,969,087 Unused borrowing capacity under Fed Discount window 1,002,486 Unused portion of line of credit 100,000

 In the ordinary course of the Company s operations, the Company has entered into certain contractual obligations and has made other commitments to make future payments. The Company believes that it will be able to meet its contractual obligations as they come due through the maintenance of adequate cash levels. The Company expects to maintain adequate cash levels through profitability, loan and securities repayment and maturity activity and continued deposit gathering activities. The Company has in place various borrowing mechanisms for both short-term and long-term liquidity needs. These include payments related to (a) time deposits with stated maturity dates, (b) short and long term borrowings, (c) operating leases and (d) commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. 
 As discussed in the Company's Annual Report of Form 10-K, the Company had accrued 100.0 million in connection with the settlement of the Stanford lawsuit. The Company paid this obligation in the second quarter 2024. 
 In the third quarter 2024, the Company completed the issuance and sale of 175.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 8.375 fixed-to-floating rate subordinated debentures and simultaneously redeemed 110.0 million of its outstanding 5.875 fixed rate subordinated debentures due August 1, 2024. Refer to Note 5. Federal Home Loan Bank Advances and Other Borrowings for more details. 
 Other than discussed above and normal changes in the ordinary course of business, there have been no significant changes in the types of contractual obligations or amounts due since December 31, 2023. 
 The Company is a corporation separate and apart from the Bank and, therefore, the Company must provide for the Company s own liquidity. The Company s main source of funding is dividends declared and paid to the Company by the Bank. Statutory and regulatory limitations exist that affect the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company. Management believes that these limitations will not impact the Company s ability to meet the Company s ongoing short-term cash obligations. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the Company s reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under current circumstances, results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. The Company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 As described in detail in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, accounting policies are an integral part of the Company s financial statements. A thorough understanding of these accounting policies is essential when reviewing the Company s reported results of operations and the Company s financial position. The Company has deemed the accounting policy and estimate discussed below as most critical and require the Company to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these estimates, which are likely to occur from period to period, or the use of different estimates that the Company could have reasonably used in the current period, would have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The Company has other significant accounting policies and continues to evaluate the materiality of their impact on its consolidated financial statements, but management believes these other policies either do not generally require them to make estimates and judgments that are difficult or subjective, or it is less likely they would have a material impact on the Company's reported results for a given period. 
 Allowance For Credit Losses. Management considers policies related to the allowance for credit losses on financial instruments for loans and off-balance sheet credit exposures to be critical to the financial statements. The Company's policies for the allowance for credit losses are accounted for under ASC 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. In accordance with ASC 326, the allowance for credit losses on loans is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. Loans are charged against the allowance for credit losses when management believes that collectability of the principal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The allowance is increased (decreased) by provision expense (reversal) reported in the income statement as a component of provision for credit loss. Under the guidance, the allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is a liability account representing expected credit losses over the contractual period for which the Company is exposed to credit risk resulting from a contractual obligation to extend credit. 
 62 

Table of Contents 

 The amount of each allowance account represents management's best estimate of current expected credit losses on such financial instruments using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, credit quality, or term as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in unemployment rates, gross domestic product, property values or other relevant factors. The Company utilizes Moody s Analytics economic forecast scenarios and assigns probability weighting to those scenarios which best reflect management s views on the economic forecast. 
 The allowance for credit losses for loans is measured on a collective basis for portfolios of loans when similar risk characteristics exist. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis and excluded from the collective evaluation. For determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses on a collective basis, the loan portfolio is segmented into pools based upon similar risk characteristics and a lifetime loss-rate model is utilized. The measurement of expected credit losses is impacted by loan/borrower attributes and certain macroeconomic variables. Management has determined that they are reasonably able to forecast the macroeconomic variables used in the modeling processes with an acceptable degree of confidence for a total of two years then encompassing a reversion process whereby the forecasted macroeconomic variables are reverted to their historical mean utilizing a rational, systematic basis. Management qualitatively adjusts model results for risk factors that are not considered within the modeling processes but are nonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within the loan pools. These qualitative factor (Q-Factor) adjustments may increase or decrease management's estimate of expected credit losses by a calculated percentage or amount based upon the estimated level of r isk. 
 Due to the subjective nature of these estimates in general and more so due to the multiple variables used in the calculation, the estimate for determining current expected credit losses is subject to uncertainty. The various components of the calculation require significant management judgement and certain assumptions are highly subjective. Volatility in certain credit metrics and variations between expected and actual outcomes are likely. 
 Further information regarding Company policies and methodology used to estimate the allowance for credit losses is presented in Note 4. Loans, Net and Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Note 6. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Commitments and Contingencies . 
 Goodwill. The excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets from acquisitions, or goodwill, is evaluated for impairment at least annually and on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is likely an impairment has occurred. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing a quantitative impairment test is unnecessary. If the Company concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform an impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit. The Company performs its impairment test annually as of December 31, or at an interim date, if a triggering event occurs. 
 During the first half of 2024, continued market volatility in the banking sector resulted in the Company's stock trading below book value. In addition, entering into a merger agreement with SSB in second quarter 2024 as described in Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , triggered an interim assessment as the terms of the merger indicated an implied consideration less than book value. The Company determined the estimated fair value of the Company was equal to the implied valuation of the transaction based on the conversion ratio to SSB's stock price. As such, an impairment charge of 518.0 million was recorded in second quarter to reduce the Company's carrying value to estimated fair value. The impairment was a non-cash charge to earnings and had no impact to regulatory capital ratios, cash flows, or liquidity position. 
 During the third quarter 2024, market conditions in the industry stabilized and stock values for both SSB and the Company increased resulting in the Company's implied value, as noted above, exceeding its book value as of September 30, 2024, and indicating no further decline in value that would trigger an interim assessment or additional impairment charge. 
 Refer to Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , in the notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.

 Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant management judgment and the use of subjective measurements. Variability in the market and changes in assumptions or subjective measurements used to allocate fair value are reasonably possible and may have a material impact on the Company s financial position, liquidity or results of operations. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
 The Company has evaluated new accounting standards that have recently been issued and have determined that there are no new accounting standards that should be described in this section that will materially impact the Company s operations, financial condition or liquidity in future periods.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and other relevant market rates and prices, such as equity prices. The risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows, and future earnings. Due to the nature of our operations, we are primarily exposed to interest rate risk. 
 Asset/Liability Management and Interest Rate Risk 
 The principal objective of the Company s asset and liability management function is to measure, monitor, and control the interest rate risk within the balance sheet while maximizing net income and preserving adequate levels of liquidity and capital. The Board Risk Oversight Committee has oversight of the asset and liability management function, which is managed by ALCO under the direction of the Company s Treasurer. ALCO, which members include the Treasurer, Chief Financial Officer and other senior management, meets regularly to review, among other things, the sensitivity of the Company s assets and liabilities to interest rate changes, as well as local and national market conditions. That management subcommittee also reviews the liquidity, deposit mix, loan mix and investment positions of the Company. 
 The Company s management and the Board of Directors are responsible for employing risk management policies that monitor and limit the Company s exposure to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is measured using net interest income simulations, gap analyses and market value of equity analyses. These analyses use various assumptions, including the magnitude and timing of interest rate changes, yield curve shape, prepayments on loans and securities and deposits, deposit decay rates, pricing decisions on loans and deposits, reinvestment and replacement of asset and liability cash flows. 
 Instantaneous parallel rate shift scenarios, known as rate shocks, are modeled and utilized to evaluate risk and establish exposure limits for acceptable changes in net interest margin. 
 The Company also analyzes the economic value of equity as an additional measure of interest rate risk. This is a complementary measure to net interest income where the calculated value is the result of the market value of assets less the market value of liabilities. The economic value of equity is a longer term view of interest rate risk because it measures the present value of the future cash flows. The impact of changes in interest rates on this calculation is analyzed for the risk to the Company s future earnings and is used in conjunction with the analyses on net interest income. The Company also runs customized scenarios to aid in decision making as well as stress test assumptions to confirm that the outputs are reasonable. 
 The Company conducts periodic analyses of its sensitivity to interest rate risk through the use of a third-party proprietary interest-rate sensitivity model that is run internally and has been customized to the Company's specifications. The analyses conducted by use of that model are based on current information regarding the Company's actual interest-earnings assets, interest-bearing liabilities, capital and other financial information that it supplies. The Company uses the information in the model to aid in its risk management framework surrounding the net interest margin. 
 The Company s asset liability management model indicated that it was in a liability sensitive position in terms of its income simulation as of September 30, 2024. The table below illustrates the impact of an immediate and sustained 200 and 100 basis point increase and a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates on net interest income over twelve months based on the interest rate risk model as of September 30, 2024: 
 Hypothetical Shift in Interest Rates (in bps) Change in Projected Net Interest Income 200 (7.44) 100 (3.25) (100) 2.88 
 The Company's model indicates that its projected balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 remains in a liability sensitive position as compared to the December 31, 2023 balance sheet. Loan demand slowed during the period and was funded with growth in traditional core deposit products. Additionally, growth in time deposits, primarily in 6-to-13-month maturities, have continued to keep term funding levels relatively short. The Company has strategically positioned the duration of its liabilities to remain short in order to maximize its ability to grow net interest income during periods of flat or falling interest rates. 
 65 

Table of Contents 

 These are good faith estimates and assume that the composition of the Company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at each year-end is held consistent. Additionally, the forecast takes into consideration the future maturities and contractual interest rate repricing over the relevant twelve-month measurement period. Lastly, the model assumes that changes in market interest rates are instantaneous and sustained across the yield curve regardless of duration of pricing characteristics of specific assets or liabilities. This analysis does not contemplate any actions that the Company might undertake in response to changes in market interest rates. As a result, the Company believes these estimates are not necessarily indicative of what actually could occur in the event of immediate interest rate increases or decreases of this magnitude. As interest-bearing assets and liabilities re-price in different time frames and proportions to market interest rate movements, various assumptions must be made based on historical relationships of these variables in reaching any conclusion. Since these correlations are based on competitive and market conditions, the Company anticipates that future results will likely be different from the foregoing estimates, and such differences could be material. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures . An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. 
 All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting . There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
