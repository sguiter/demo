redeemable noncontrolling interest in Dana TM4 Inc., Dana TM4 Electric Holdings BV and Dana TM4 USA, LLC. The terms of the joint venture agreement provide Hydro-Qu bec with the right to put all, and not less than all, of its ownership interests in Dana TM4 Inc., Dana TM4 Electric Holdings BV and Dana TM4 USA, LLC to Dana at fair value. We estimate the fair value of the redemption value using an income-based approach based on discounted cash flow projections. In determining fair value using discounted cash flow projections, we make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, including revenue growth rates, projected EBITDA, discount rates, and terminal growth rates. 
 
 On May 6, 2024, Hydro-Qu bec provided Dana with its put notice. Subsequent to May 6, 2024, Dana will no longer attribute net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss) items of Dana TM4 Inc., Dana TM4 Electric Holdings BV and Dana TM4 USA, LLC to Hydro-Qu bec's redeemable noncontrolling interest. Closure of the transaction will proceed in accordance with the provisions of the shareholders agreement.

 Weighted-average common shares outstanding - Basic 
 Employee compensation-related shares 
 Weighted-average common shares outstanding - Diluted 

The share count for diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus the effects of dilutive common stock equivalents (CSEs) outstanding during the period. We excluded million and million CSEs from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023 and excluded million and million of CSEs for the respective year-to-date periods as the effect of including them would have been anti-dilutive. 

PSUs 

Weighted-average per share 
 
 We calculated the fair value of the RSUs at grant date based on the closing market price of our common stock at the date of grant. The number of PSUs that ultimately vest is contingent on achieving specified financial targets and specified total shareholder return targets relative to peer companies. For the portion of the award based on financial metrics, we estimated the fair value of the PSUs at grant date based on the closing market price of our common stock at the date of grant adjusted for the value of assumed dividends over the period because the awards are not dividend protected. For the portion of the award based on shareholder returns, we estimated the fair value of the PSUs at grant date using various assumptions as part of a Monte Carlo simulation. The expected term represents the period from the grant date to the end of the three -year performance period. The risk-free interest rate of was based on U.S. Treasury constant maturity rates at the grant date. The dividend yield of was calculated using our historical approach calculated by dividing the expected annual dividend by the average stock price over the prior year. The estimated volatility of was based on observed historical volatility of daily stock returns for the 3 -year period preceding the grant date. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we paid of cash to settle RSUs and issued million shares of common stock based on the vesting of RSUs. We recognized stock compensation expense of and in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023 , respectively and expense of and during the respective year-to-date periods. At September 30, 2024 , the total unrecognized compensation cost related to the nonvested awards granted and expected to vest was . This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of years.

Fair Value Level 2 assets and liabilities reflect the use of significant other observable inputs. 
 
 Fair value of financial instruments The financial instruments that are not carried in our balance sheets at fair value are as follows: 

Foreign currency derivatives Our foreign currency derivatives include forward contracts associated with forecasted transactions, primarily involving the purchases and sales of inventory, as well as currency swaps associated with certain recorded external notes payable and intercompany loans receivable and payable. Periodically, our foreign currency derivatives also include net investment hedges of certain of our investments in foreign operations. 
 
 We have executed fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swaps in conjunction with the issuance of certain notes to eliminate the variability in the functional-currency-equivalent cash flows due to changes in exchange rates associated with the forecasted principal and interest payments. All of the underlying designated financial instruments have been designated as the hedged items in each respective cash flow hedge relationship, as shown in the table below. Designated as cash flow hedges of the forecasted principal and interest payments of the underlying designated financial instruments, all of the swaps economically convert the underlying designated financial instruments into the functional currency of each respective holder. The impact of the interest rate differential between the inflow and outflow rates on fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swaps is recognized during each period as a component of interest expense for hedges of external debt and as a component of other income (expense), net for hedges of intercompany debt. 
 
 The following fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swaps were outstanding at September 30, 2024 : 

Luxembourg Intercompany Notes Receivable 
 Luxembourg Intercompany Notes Receivable 
 Undesignated 2026 Swap 
 Undesignated Offset 2026 Swap 

The designated swaps are expected to be highly effective in offsetting the corresponding currency-based changes in cash outflows related to the underlying designated financial instruments. Based on our qualitative assessment that the critical terms of the underlying designated financial instruments and the associated swaps match and that all other required criteria have been met, we do not expect to incur any ineffectiveness. As effective cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the swaps will be recorded in OCI during each period. Additionally, to the extent the swaps remain effective, the appropriate portion of AOCI will be reclassified to earnings each period as an offset to the foreign exchange gain or loss resulting from the remeasurement of the underlying designated financial instruments. See Note 11 for additional information about the April 2025 Notes. To the extent the swaps are no longer effective, changes in their fair values will be recorded in earnings.

Designated cash flow hedges With respect to contracts designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value during the period in which the contracts remain outstanding are reported in OCI to the extent such contracts remain effective. Effectiveness is measured by using regression analysis to determine the degree of correlation between the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument and the change in the associated foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in the fair value of contracts not designated as cash flow hedges or as net investment hedges are recognized in other income (expense), net in the period in which the changes occur. Realized gains and losses from currency-related forward contracts associated with forecasted transactions or from other derivative instruments, including those that have been designated as cash flow hedges and those that have not been designated, are recognized in the same line item in the consolidated statement of operations in which the underlying forecasted transaction or other hedged item is recorded. Accordingly, amounts are potentially recorded in sales, cost of sales or, in certain circumstances, other income (expense), net. 
 
 The following table provides a summary of deferred gains (losses) reported in AOCI as well as the amount expected to be reclassified to income in one year or less:

The amounts reclassified from AOCI into income for the cross-currency swaps represent an offset to a foreign exchange loss on our foreign currency-denominated intercompany and external debt instruments. 
 
 Certain of our hedges of forecasted transactions have not formally been designated as cash flow hedges. As undesignated forward contracts, the changes in the fair value of such contracts are included in earnings for the duration of the outstanding forward contract. Any realized gain or loss on the settlement of such contracts is recognized in the same period and in the same line item in the consolidated statement of operations as the underlying transaction. The following table provides a summary of the location and amount of gains or losses recognized in the consolidated statement of operations associated with undesignated hedging relationships. 

Other income (expense), net 

Net investment hedges We periodically designate derivative contracts or underlying non-derivative financial instruments as net investment hedges. With respect to contracts designated as net investment hedges, we apply the forward method, but for non-derivative financial instruments designated as net investment hedges, we apply the spot method. Under both methods, we report changes in fair value in the cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) component of OCI during the period in which the contracts remain outstanding to the extent such contracts and non-derivative financial instruments remain effective. During the second quarter of 2024, we entered into foreign currency forwards with a notional value of that we designated as a net investment hedge of the foreign currency exposure related to a China renminbi denominated subsidiary. These forwards will mature in September 2025. During the third quarter of 2024, we entered into foreign currency forwards with a notional value of that we designated as a net investment hedge of the foreign currency exposure related to a euro denominated subsidiary. These forwards will mature in November 2025.

 Guarantee of lease obligations In connection with the divestiture of our Structural Products business in 2010, leases covering three U.S. facilities were assigned to a U.S. affiliate of Metalsa. Under the terms of the sale agreement, we will guarantee the affiliate s performance under the leases, which run through June 2025, including approximately of annual payments. In the event of a required payment by Dana as guarantor, we are entitled to pursue full recovery from Metalsa of the amounts paid under the guarantee and to take possession of the leased property. 
 
 Other legal matters We are subject to various pending or threatened legal proceedings arising out of the normal course of business or operations. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, we cannot state the eventual outcome of these matters. However, based on current knowledge and after consultation with legal counsel, we believe that any liabilities that may result from these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.

During the first nine months of 2023, we recorded tax expense of for income tax reserves associated with prior tax years in foreign jurisdictions. Our effective income tax rates vary from the U.S. federal statutory rate of due to establishment, release, and adjustment of valuation allowances in several countries, nondeductible expenses and deemed income, local tax incentives in several countries outside the U.S., different statutory tax rates outside the U.S. and withholding taxes related to repatriations of international earnings. The effective income tax rate may vary significantly due to fluctuations in the amounts and sources, both foreign and domestic, of pretax income and changes in the amounts of non-deductible expenses.

 We continually seek new business opportunities and at times provide incentives to our customers for new program awards. We evaluate the underlying economics of each payment made to our customers to determine the proper accounting by understanding the nature of the payment, the rights and obligations in the contract, and other relevant facts and circumstances. Upfront payments to our customers are capitalized if we determine that the payments are incremental and incurred only if the new business is obtained and we expect to recover these amounts from the customer over the term of the new business program. We recognize a reduction to revenue as products that the upfront payments are related to are transferred to the customer, based on the total amount of products expected to be sold over the term of the program. We evaluate the amounts capitalized each period for recoverability and expense any amounts that are no longer expected to be recovered. We had and recorded in other current assets and and recorded in other noncurrent assets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . 
 
 Certain of our customer contracts include rebate incentives. We estimate expected rebates and accrue the corresponding refund liability, as a reduction of revenue, at the time covered product is sold to the customer based on anticipated customer purchases during the rebate period and contractual rebate percentages. Refund liabilities are included in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We provide standard fitness for use warranties on the products we sell, accruing for estimated costs related to product warranty obligations at time of sale. See Note 14 for additional information. 

Contract liabilities are primarily comprised of cash deposits made by customers with cash in advance payment terms. Generally, our contract liabilities turn over frequently given our relatively short production cycles. Contract liabilities were and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 .

Operational and Strategic Initiatives 
 
 Our enterprise strategy builds on our strong technology foundation and leverages our resources across the organization while driving a customer-centric focus, expanding our global markets, and delivering innovative solutions as we evolve into the era of vehicle electrification. 
 
 Central to our strategy is leveraging our core operations. This foundational element enables us to infuse strong operational disciplines throughout the strategy, making it practical, actionable, and effective. It enables us to capitalize on being a major drive systems supplier across all three end mobility markets. We are achieving improved profitability by actively seeking synergies across our engineering, purchasing, and manufacturing base. We have strengthened the portfolio by acquiring critical assets, and we are utilizing our physical and intellectual capital to amplify innovation across the enterprise. Leveraging these core elements can further expand the cost efficiencies of our common technologies and deliver a sustainable competitive advantage for Dana.

Driving customer centricity continues to be at the heart of who we are. Putting our customers at the center of our value system is firmly embedded in our culture and is driving growth by focusing on customer relationships and providing value to our customers. These relationships are strengthened as we are physically located where we need to be in order to provide unparalleled service, and we are prioritizing our customers needs as we engineer solutions that differentiate their products, while making it easier to do business with Dana by digitizing their experience. Our customer-centric focus has uniquely positioned us to win more than our fair share of new business and capitalize on future customer outsourcing initiatives. 
 
 Expanding global markets means utilizing our global capabilities and presence to further penetrate growth markets, focusing on Asia due to its position as the largest mobility market in the world with the highest market growth rate as well as its lead in the adoption of new energy vehicles. We are investing across various avenues to increase our presence in Asia Pacific by forging new partnerships, expanding inorganically, and growing organically. We continue to operate in this region through wholly owned and joint ventures with local market partners. We have recently made acquisitions that have augmented our footprint in the region, specifically in India and China. All the while, we have been making meaningful organic investments to grow with existing and new customers, primarily in Thailand, India, and China. These added capabilities have enabled us to target the domestic Asia Pacific markets and utilize the capacity for export to other global markets. We continue to enhance and expand our global footprint, optimizing it to capture growth across all of our end markets. 
 
 Delivering innovative solutions enables us to capitalize on market growth trends as we evolve our core technology capabilities. We are also focused on enhancing our physical products with digital content to provide smart systems, and we see an opportunity to become a digital systems provider by delivering software as a service to our traditional end customers. This focus on delivering solutions based on our core technology is leading to new business wins and increasing our content per vehicle. We have made significant investments - both organically and inorganically - allowing us to move to the next phase, which is to Lead electric propulsion . 
 
 We continue to deliver on our goal to accelerate vehicle electrification through both core Dana technologies and targeted strategic acquisitions and are positioned today to lead the market. Our investments in electrodynamic expertise and technologies combined with Dana s longstanding mechatronics capabilities has allowed us to develop and deliver fully integrated e-Propulsion systems that are power-dense and achieve optimal efficiency through the integration of the components that we offer due to our mechatronics capabilities. With recent electric vehicle program awards, we are well on our way to achieving our growth objectives in this emerging market. 
 
 The development and implementation of our enterprise strategy is positioning Dana to grow profitably due to increased customer focus as we leverage our core capabilities, expand into new markets, develop and commercialize new technologies, including for electric vehicles. 
 
 Capital Structure Initiatives 
 
 In addition to investing in our business, we plan to prioritize a balanced allocation of capital while maintaining a strong balance sheet. 
 
 Shareholder return actions When evaluating capital structure initiatives, we balance our growth opportunities and shareholder value initiatives with maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders. Except for three quarters in 2020, when we temporarily suspended dividends to common shareholders in response to the global COVID pandemic, we have paid quarterly dividends to our common shareholders since the first quarter of 2012. 
 
 Financing actions Our current portfolio of unsecured senior notes is structured such that no more than 473 of senior notes comes due in any calendar year, with no maturities until the second quarter of 2025. Our 1,150 revolving credit facility matures on March 14, 2028. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of Part I for additional information. 
 
 Other Initiatives 
 
 Aftermarket opportunities We have a global group dedicated to identifying and developing aftermarket growth opportunities that leverage the capabilities within our existing businesses targeting increased future aftermarket sales. Powered by recognized brands such as Dana , Spicer , Spicer Electrified , Victor Reinz , Glaser , GWB , Thompson , Tru-Cool , SVL , and Transejes , Dana delivers a broad range of aftermarket solutions including genuine, all makes, and value lines servicing passenger, commercial, and off-highway vehicles across the globe. 
 
 Selective acquisitions Although transformational opportunities will be considered when strategically and economically attractive, our acquisition focus is principally directed at bolt-on or adjacent acquisition opportunities that have a strategic fit with our existing core businesses, particularly opportunities that support our enterprise strategy and enhance the value proposition of our product offerings. Any potential acquisition will be evaluated in the same manner we currently consider customer program opportunities and other uses of capital with a disciplined financial approach designed to ensure profitable growth and increased shareholder value.

Trends in Our Markets 
 
 We serve our customers in three core global end markets: light vehicle, primarily full-frame trucks and SUVs; commercial vehicle, including medium- and heavy-duty trucks and busses; and off-highway, including construction, mining, and agriculture equipment. 
 
 Each of our end-markets has unique cyclical dynamics and market drivers. These cycles are impacted by periods of investment where end-user vehicle fleets are refreshed or expanded in reaction to demand usage patterns, regulatory changes, or when the age of vehicles in service reach their useful life. Key market drivers include regional economic growth rates; cost and availability of end customer financing; industrial output; commodity production and pricing; and residential and nonresidential construction rates. Our multi-market coverage and broad customer base help provide stability across the cycles while mitigating secular variability. During 2023, we saw incremental improvements across our end markets despite continuing, but lessening, global supply chain disruptions. 
 
 Light vehicle markets Our driveline business is weighted more heavily to the truck and SUV segments of the light-vehicle market versus the passenger-car segment. Our vehicle content is greater on rear-wheel drive, four-wheel drive, and all-wheel drive vehicles, as well as hybrid and electric vehicles. During 2023, light-truck markets improved across all regions except North America, which was negatively impacted by labor strikes during the fourth quarter of 2023 at the U.S. operations of several original equipment manufacturers. The outlook for the full year of 2024 reflects global light-truck production being relatively stable across all regions in comparison with the prior year. 
 
 Commercial vehicle markets Our primary business is driveline systems for medium and heavy-duty trucks and busses, including the emerging market for hybrid and electric vehicles. Key regional markets are North America, South America (primarily Brazil) and Asia Pacific. During 2023, production of Class-8 trucks in North America increased 8 over 2022 reflecting increased demand driven by higher freight volumes and rates during the first half of 2023, with demand tapering during the second half of 2023 as freight volumes and rates trended downward. The outlook for 2024 is for weakening demand with production down moderately from 2023 levels driven by lower year-over-year freight volumes and rates. Medium-duty truck production in North America experienced a modest 9 year-over-year increase from 2022 to 2023. The outlook for 2024 is for a moderate decrease in production over the prior year. Outside of North America, production of medium- and heavy-duty trucks in South America declined 32 in 2023 reflecting weak economic conditions in the region. The 2024 outlook for South America is for a moderate increase in production from 2023 as local economic conditions are expected to somewhat improve. Production of medium- and heavy-duty trucks in Asia Pacific, driven by China and India, increased 18 in 2023. The 2024 outlook for Asia Pacific is for a modest decrease in production from the prior year. 
 
 Off-highway markets Our off-highway business has a large presence outside of North America, with 68 of its 2023 sales coming from products manufactured in Europe however, a large portion of these products are utilized in vehicle production outside the region. The construction equipment segment of the off-highway market is closely related to global economic growth and infrastructure investment. The global construction equipment market continued to rebound in 2023 with production up 5 over the prior year. The outlook for 2024 is for moderately lower production levels in North America, Europe and South America, with relatively stable production levels in Asia Pacific. End-user investment in the mining equipment segment is driven by prices for commodity products produced by underground mining. The global mining equipment market has been mostly stable over the past several years as industry participants have maintained vehicle inventory levels to match commodity output, and this trend is expected to continue in 2024. The agriculture equipment market is the third of our key off-highway segments. Like the underground mining segment, investment in agriculture equipment is primarily driven by prices for commodities. Farm commodity price decreases in 2023 spurred a 2 decrease in agriculture equipment production. The outlook for 2024 is for global end-market demand to soften, reflecting a moderate decrease from the prior year.

Foreign currency With 54 of our year-to-date 2024 sales coming from outside the U.S., international currency movements can have a significant effect on our sales and results of operations. The euro zone countries accounted for 48 of our year-to-date 2024 non-U.S. sales, while India, Brazil and China accounted for 10 , 9 and 8 , respectively. Although sales in South Africa are less than 5 of our non-U.S. sales, the rand has been volatile and significantly impacted sales from time to time. International currencies weakened against the U.S. dollar in the first nine months of 2024, decreasing sales by 34, with the effects of a weaker Brazilian real, Chinese renminbi, Thai baht and Indian rupee, being partially offset by a stronger euro. 
 
 Argentina has experienced significant inflationary pressures the past few years, contributing to significant devaluation of its currency among other economic challenges. Our Argentine operation supports our Light Vehicle operating segment. Our sales in Argentina for the first nine months of 2024 of approximately 165 are 2 of our consolidated sales and our net asset exposure related to Argentina was approximately 67, including 21 of net fixed assets, at September 30, 2024. During the second quarter of 2018, we determined that Argentina's economy met the GAAP definition of a highly inflationary economy. In assessing Argentina's economy as highly inflationary we considered its three-year cumulative inflation rate along with other factors. As a result, effective July 1, 2018, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our Argentine operations, rather than the Argentine peso. Beginning July 1, 2018, peso-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars using current Argentine peso exchange rates with resulting translation gains or losses included in results of operations. Nonmonetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollar using historic Argentine peso exchange rates. 
 
 Commodity costs The cost of our products may be significantly impacted by changes in raw material commodity prices, the most important to us being those of various grades of steel, aluminum, copper, brass and rare earth materials. The effects of changes in commodity prices are reflected directly in our purchases of commodities and indirectly through our purchases of products such as castings, forgings, bearings, batteries and component parts that include commodities. Most of our major customer agreements provide for the sharing of significant commodity price changes with those customers based on the movement in various published commodity indexes. Where such formal agreements are not present, we have historically been successful implementing price adjustments that largely compensate for the inflationary impact of material costs. Material cost changes will customarily have some impact on our financial results as customer pricing adjustments typically lag commodity price changes. Lower year-over-year commodity prices increased earnings during the first nine months of 2024 by 17. Material cost recovery pricing actions decreased earnings in the first nine months of 2024 by 45.

Providing net income guidance is potentially misleading and not practical given the difficulty of projecting event driven transactional and other non-core operating items that are included in net income, including restructuring actions, asset impairments and certain income tax adjustments. The accompanying reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures with the most comparable GAAP measures for the historical periods presented are indicative of the reconciliations that will be prepared upon completion of the periods covered by the non-GAAP guidance. 
 
 Our current 2024 sales outlook is 10,200 to 10,400, a decrease of 400 at the mid-point of the range from our prior guidance, reflecting weaker global commercial vehicle and agricultural and construction/mining equipment markets, a further reduction in electric-vehicle demand and lower customer demand associated with one of our full-frame light-truck programs. Based on our current sales and exchange rate outlook for 2024, we expect overall stability in international currencies with a modest headwind to sales primarily due to a weaker Brazilian real, Chinese renminbi, Thai baht and Indian rupee, partially offset by a stronger euro. At sales levels in our current outlook for 2024, a 5 movement on the euro would impact our annual sales by approximately 30. A 5 change on the Chinese renminbi, Indian rupee or Brazilian real rates would impact our annual sales in each of those countries by approximately 5. At our current sales outlook for 2024, we expect full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA to approximate 855 to 895, 50 lower from our prior guidance at the midpoint of the range. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is expected to be 8.5 at the midpoint of our guidance range, a 50 basis-point improvement over 2023, reflecting higher margin net new business and improving operational performance being partially offset by the benefit of the material cost recovery tailwind experienced in 2023 dissipating in 2024, as commodity prices stabilize, and increased investment to support our electrification strategy. We expect to generate free cash flow of approximately 100 at the midpoint of our guidance range, reflecting a year-over-year reduction in anticipated capital spending.

Sales in the third quarter of 2024 were 193 lower than in 2023. Weaker international currencies decreased sales by 15, principally due to a weaker Brazilian real, partially offset by a stronger euro. The organic sales decrease of 176, or 7 , primarily resulted from declining global construction/mining and agricultural equipment markets, lower global light-truck production volumes and lower medium/heavy-truck production volumes in North America and Asia Pacific, partially offset by the conversion of sales backlog. Pricing actions and recoveries, including material commodity price and inflationary costs adjustments, increased sales by 16. 
 
 The North America organic sales decrease of 3 was driven principally lower full-frame light-truck and medium- and heavy-duty truck production volumes, partially offset by the conversion of sales backlog and net customer pricing and cost recovery actions. Third quarter 2024 full-frame light-truck production was down 3 , Class 8 production was down 12 and Classes 5-7 was down 11 compared to 2023. Excluding currency effects, sales in Europe were down 15 compared with 2023. With our significant Off-Highway presence in the region, weaker construction/mining and agricultural equipment markets were a major factor. Organic sales in this operating segment were down 15 compared with 2023. Excluding currency effects, sales in South America were up 16 compared with 2023, reflecting improved medium- and heavy-duty truck production volumes. Excluding currency effects, sales in Asia Pacific decreased 12 compared to 2023, reflecting lower electric vehicle related product sales.

Cost of sales and gross margin Cost of sales for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 202 when compared to 2023. Cost of sales as a percent of sales was 110 basis points lower than in the previous year. Incremental margins from higher material cost savings of 31, operational efficiencies of 21, commodity cost decreases of 13, lower premium freight costs of 7, lower warranty expense of 5, lower incentive compensation expense of 4 and lower program launch costs of 2 were partially offset by unfavorable product mix, non-material inflation of 33 and higher spending on electrification initiatives of 2. Commodity costs are primarily driven by certain grades of steel and aluminum. Non-material inflation includes higher labor, energy and transportation rates. 
 
 Gross margin of 245 for the third quarter of 2024 increased 9 from 2023. Gross margin as a percent of sales was 9.9 in the third quarter of 2024, 110 basis points higher than in 2023. The improvement in gross margin as a percent of sales was driven principally by the cost of sales factors referenced above. Material cost recovery mechanisms with our customers lag material cost changes by our suppliers by approximately 90 days. With commodity costs abating during the third quarter of 2024, gross margin was negatively impacted by net material cost recoveries on both a dollar and percentage basis. The recovery of non-material inflation is not specifically provided for in our current contracts with customers resulting in prolonged negotiations and indeterminate recoveries. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG A) SG A expenses in the third quarter of 2024 were 130 (5.3 of sales) as compared to 126 (4.7 of sales) in the third quarter of 2023. SG A expenses were 4 higher in the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to higher salary and employee benefit costs. 
 
 Amortization of intangibles Amortization expense was 3 in both the third quarters of 2024 and 2023. See Note 3 of our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of Part I for additional information. 
 
 Restructuring charges, net Net restructuring charges were 24 in the third quarter of 2024 and 17 in the third quarter of 2023 . See Note 4 of our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of Part I for additional information. 
 
 Gain on disposal group previously held for sale In February 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our European hydraulics business to HPIH S. r.l. We classified the disposal group as held for sale in the first quarter of 2024. The transaction was not completed by the date set forth in the definitive agreement. The disposal group is no longer held for sale. See Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of Part I for additional information.

Strategic transaction expenses relate primarily to costs incurred in connection with acquisition and divestiture related activities, including costs to complete the transaction and post-closing integration costs, and other strategic initiatives. Strategic transaction expenses in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 were primarily attributable to investigating potential acquisitions and business ventures and other strategic initiatives. 
 
 Interest income and interest expense Interest income was 4 in the third quarter of 2024 and 5 in the third quarter of 2023. Interest expense was 40 in the third quarter of 2024 and 41 in the third quarter of 2023, reflecting higher average outstanding borrowings in 2024 being offset by lower average interest rates. Average effective interest rates, inclusive of amortization of debt issuance costs, approximated 5.8 in the third quarter of 2024 and 6.1 in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Income tax expense We reported income tax expense of 43 and 33 for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our effective tax rates were 83 and 60 for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our effective income tax rates vary from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 due to establishment, release and adjustment of valuation allowances in several countries outside the U.S., different statutory tax rates outside the U.S. and withholding taxes related to repatriations of international earnings. The effective income tax rate may vary significantly due to fluctuations in the amounts and sources, both foreign and domestic, of pretax income and changes in the amounts of nondeductible expenses. 
 
 Equity in earnings of affiliates Net earnings from equity investments was 2 in the third quarter of 2024 and 3 in the third quarter of 2023. Net earnings from Dongfeng Dana Axle Co., Ltd. (DDAC) were de minimis in the third quarter of 2024 and 1 in the third quarter of 2023.

Sales in 2024 were 112 lower than in 2024. Weaker international currencies decreased sales by 34, principally due to a weaker Brazilian real, Chinese renminbi, Thai baht and Indian rupee, partially offset by a stronger euro. The organic sales decrease of 74, or 1 , resulted from declining global construction/mining and agricultural equipment markets, which were partially offset by having a full nine months of production on a full-frame light-truck customer program that launched and was ramping up production in the first quarter of last year and the conversion of sales backlog. Pricing actions and recoveries, including material commodity price and inflationary cost adjustments, increased sales by 68. 
 
 The North America organic sales increase of 5 was driven principally by having a full nine months of production on a full-frame light-truck customer program that launched and was ramping up production in the first quarter of last year, the conversion of sales backlog and net customer pricing and cost recovery actions.

Cost of sales and gross margin Cost of sales for the nine months of 2024 decreased 120, or 2 , when compared to 2023. Cost of sales as a percent of sales was 30 basis points lower than in the previous year. Incremental margins resulting from higher material cost savings of 99, operational efficiencies of 39, lower premium freight costs of 29, lower commodity costs of 17, lower program launch costs of 10, lower incentive compensation expense of 7 and lower warranty expense of 3 were partially offset by unfavorable product mix, non-material inflation of 129 and higher spending on electrification initiatives of 17. Commodity costs are primarily driven by certain grades of steel and aluminum. Non-material inflation includes higher labor, energy and transportation rates. 
 
 Gross margin of 744 for the first nine months of 2024 increased 8 from 2023. Gross margin as a percent of sales was 9.4 in the first nine months of 2024, 30 basis points higher than in 2023. The improvement in gross margin as a percent of sales was driven principally by the cost of sales factors referenced above. Material cost recovery mechanisms with our customers lag material cost changes by our suppliers by approximately 90 days. With commodity costs abating during the first nine months of 2024, gross margin was negatively impacted by net material cost recoveries on both a dollar and percentage basis. The recovery of non-material inflation is not specifically provided for in our current contracts with customers resulting in prolonged negotiations and indeterminate recoveries. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG A) SG A expenses in the first nine months of 2024 were 401 (5.0 of sales) as compared to 410 (5.1 of sales) in the first nine months of 2023. SG A expenses were 9 lower in the first nine months of 2024 due to lower incentive compensation, lower professional services and consulting costs and lower marketing expenditures.

Strategic transaction expenses relate primarily to costs incurred in connection with acquisition and divestiture related activities, including costs to complete the transaction and post-closing integration costs, and other strategic initiatives. Strategic transaction expenses in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 were primarily attributable to investigating potential acquisitions and business ventures and other strategic initiatives. 
 
 Loss on extinguishment of debt On June 9, 2023 we redeemed 200 of our April 2025 Notes. The 1 loss on extinguishment of debt is comprised of the write-off of previously deferred financing costs associated with the April 2025 Notes. See Note 11 of our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of Part I for additional information. 
 
 Interest income and interest expense Interest income was 10 in the first nine months of 2024 and 14 in the first nine months of 2023. Interest expense increased from 114 in the first nine months of 2023 to 118 in the first nine months of 2024, due to higher average outstanding borrowings and higher average interest rates. Average effective interest rates, inclusive of amortization of debt issuance costs, approximated 5.7 in the first nine months of 2024 and 5.6 in the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Income tax expense We reported income tax expense of 134 and 118 for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our effective tax rates were 87 and 58 for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the first nine months of 2024, we recorded tax expense of 11 for valuation allowances related to foreign jurisdictions and tax expense of 11 due to revisions in our assertions on unremitted earnings in foreign jurisdictions. During the first nine months of 2023, we recorded tax expense of 19 for income tax reserves associated with prior tax years in foreign jurisdictions. Our effective income tax rates vary from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 due to establishment, release and adjustment of valuation allowances in several countries outside the U.S., different statutory tax rates outside the U.S. and withholding taxes related to repatriations of international earnings. The effective income tax rate may vary significantly due to fluctuations in the amounts and sources, both foreign and domestic, of pretax income and changes in the amounts of nondeductible expenses. 
 
 Equity in earnings of affiliates Net earnings from equity investments was 7 in the first nine months of 2024 and 6 in the first nine months of 2023. Net earnings from Dongfeng Dana Axle Co., Ltd. (DDAC) were 1 in both the first nine months of 2024 and 2023.

Year-over-year global construction/mining equipment and agricultural equipment markets are softening, especially in Europe. Year-over-year third quarter construction/mining equipment and agricultural equipment production in Europe were down 12 and 24 , respectively. Off-Highway sales in the first nine months of 2024, exclusive of currency and divestiture effects, were 11 lower than 2023 reflecting softening global markets and the impact of net customer pricing and cost recovery actions. Year-over-year global construction/mining equipment and agricultural equipment markets are softening, especially in Europe. Year-over-year first nine months construction/mining equipment and agricultural equipment production in Europe were down 12 and 24 , respectively. Net customer pricing and cost recovery actions decreased year-over-year sales by 6 and 22 in this year s third quarter and first nine months, respectively. 
 
 Off-Highway segment EBITDA decreased 7 and 25 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, from the comparable periods of 2023. Lower sales volumes decreased year-over-year earnings by 25 (24 decremental margin) in the third quarter of 2024. Lower sales volumes decreased year-over-year earnings by 68 (28 decremental margin) in the first nine months of 2024. The year-over-year performance-related earnings increase in the third quarter of 2024 was driven by operational efficiencies of 12, higher material cost savings of 7, lower warranty expense of 4, lower premium freight costs of 2, commodity cost decreases of 2 and lower incentive compensation expense of 1. Partially offsetting these performance-related earnings increases were net customer pricing and cost recovery actions of 6, inflationary cost increases of 3 and higher program launch costs of 1. The year-over-year performance-related earnings increase in the first nine months of 2024 was driven by higher material costs savings of 24, operational efficiencies of 22, commodity cost decreases of 12, lower premium freight costs of 6, lower warranty expense of 6 and lower incentive compensation expense of 1. Partially offsetting these performance-related earning increases were net customer pricing and cost recovery actions of 22, inflationary cost increases of 4 and higher program launch costs of 1.

Power Technologies primarily serves the light-vehicle market but also sells product to the medium/heavy-truck and off-highway markets. Power Technologies sales in the third quarter of 2024, exclusive of currency effects, were 4 higher than 2023, reflecting the conversion of sales backlog, partially offset by weaker global markets and the impact of net customer pricing actions. Year-over-year light vehicle engine production in North America and Europe were down 5 and 7 , respectively. Power Technologies sales in the first nine months of 2024, exclusive of currency effects, were 5 higher than 2023, reflecting the conversion of sales backlog and the benefit of net customer pricing actions, partially offset by weaker global markets. Year-over-year light vehicle engine production in North America and Europe were down 1 and 4 , respectively. Net customer pricing and cost recovery actions decreased year-over-year sales by 3 in this year s third quarter and increased year-over-year sales by 5 in this year s first nine months. 
 
 Power Technologies third-quarter segment EBITDA decreased 2 and first nine months segment EBITDA increased 5 from the comparable periods of 2023. The EBITDA benefit of higher sales volumes was offset by unfavorable product mix in both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024. The year-over-year performance-related earnings decrease in the third quarter of 2024 was driven by commodity cost increases of 4, inflationary cost increases of 4 and net customer pricing and cost recovery actions of 3. These performance-related earnings decreases were partially offset by higher material costs savings of 7, lower spending on electrification initiatives of 1, lower incentive compensation expense of 1 and lower program launch costs of 1. The year-over-year performance-related earnings increase in the first nine months of 2024 was driven by higher material cost savings of 18, net customer pricing and cost recovery actions of 5, lower program launch costs of 2, lower incentive compensation expense of 2 and lower spending on electrification initiatives of 1. These performance-related earnings increases were partially offset by operational inefficiencies of 11, inflationary cost increases of 9, higher premium freight costs of 1 and higher warranty expense of 1.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 We have defined adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, equity grant expense, restructuring expense, non-service cost components of pension and other postretirement benefits (OPEB) costs and other adjustments not related to our core operations (gain/loss on debt extinguishment, pension settlements, divestitures, impairment, etc.). Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of our ability to maintain and continue to invest in our operations and provide shareholder returns. We use adjusted EBITDA in assessing the effectiveness of our business strategies, evaluating and pricing potential acquisitions and as a factor in making incentive compensation decisions. In addition to its use by management, we also believe adjusted EBITDA is a measure widely used by securities analysts, investors and others to evaluate financial performance of our company relative to other Tier 1 automotive suppliers. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for earnings (loss) before income taxes, net income (loss) or other results reported in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Free Cash Flow 
 
 We have defined free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. We believe free cash flow is useful to investors in evaluating the operational cash flow of the company inclusive of the spending required to maintain the operations. Free cash flow is not intended to represent nor be an alternative to the measure of net cash provided by operating activities reported in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 
 
 The following table reconciles net cash flows provided by operating activities to free cash flow.

A portion of the non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents is utilized for working capital and other operating purposes. Several countries have local regulatory requirements that restrict the ability of our operations to repatriate this cash. Beyond these restrictions, there are practical limitations on repatriation of cash from certain subsidiaries because of the resulting tax withholdings and subsidiary by-law restrictions which could limit our ability to access cash and other assets. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants of our financing agreements. Under the Revolving Facility and our senior notes, we are required to comply with certain incurrence-based covenants customary for facilities of these types. The incurrence-based covenants in the Revolving Facility permit us to, among other things, (i) issue foreign subsidiary indebtedness, (ii) incur general secured indebtedness subject to a pro forma first lien net leverage ratio not to exceed 1.50:1.00 in the case of first lien debt and a pro forma secured net leverage ratio of 2.50:1.00 in the case of other secured debt and (iii) incur additional unsecured debt subject to a pro forma total net leverage ratio not to exceed 3.50:1.00, tested at the time of incurrence. We may also make dividend payments in respect of our common stock as well as certain investments and acquisitions subject to a pro forma total net leverage ratio of 2.75:1.00. In addition, the Revolving Facility is subject to a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a first lien net leverage ratio not to exceed 2.00:1.00. The indentures governing the senior notes include other incurrence-based covenants that may subject us to additional specified limitations. 
 
 From time to time, depending upon market, pricing and other conditions, as well as our cash balances and liquidity, we may seek to acquire our senior notes or other indebtedness through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers, exchange offers or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine (or as may be provided for in the indentures governing the notes), for cash, securities or other consideration. In addition, we may enter into sale-leaseback transactions related to certain of our real estate holdings and factor receivables. There can be no assurance that we will pursue any such transactions in the future, as the pursuit of any alternative will depend upon numerous factors such as market conditions, our financial performance and the limitations applicable to such transactions under our financing and governance documents. 
 
 The principal sources of liquidity available for our future cash requirements are expected to be (i) cash flows from operations, (ii) cash and cash equivalents on hand and (iii) borrowings from our Revolving Facility. We believe that our overall liquidity and operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for capital expenditures, working capital, debt obligations and other commitments during the next twelve months. While uncertainty surrounding the current economic environment could adversely impact our business, based on our current financial position, we believe it is unlikely that any such effects would preclude us from maintaining sufficient liquidity.

Operating activities Exclusive of working capital, other cash provided by operations was 409 in 2024 and 367 in 2023. The year-over-year increase is primarily attributable to higher operating earnings in 2024. 
 
 Working capital used cash of 261 and 169 in 2024 and 2023. Cash of 77 and 243 was used to finance receivables in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash of 42 and 116 was used to fund higher inventory levels in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Decreases in accounts payable and other net liabilities used cash of 142 in 2024 while increases in accounts payable and other net liabilities provided cash of 190 in 2023. 
 
 Investing activities Expenditures for property, plant and equipment were 227 and 359 during 2024 and 2023. Elevated capital spending in 2023 was driven by the high volume of new program launches in that year. 
 
 Financing activities During 2024 and 2023, we had net borrowings of 10 and net repayments of 25 on our Revolving Facility, respectively. During 2024, we paid the 25 note payable due to the former owners of SME S.p.A. During 2023, we completed the issuance of 425 of our July 2031 Notes, paying financings costs of 7. Also during 2023, we redeemed 200 of our April 2025 Notes. During 2023, we paid financing costs of 2 to amend our credit and guaranty agreement, extending the Revolving Facility maturity to March 14, 2028. We used cash of 43 for dividend payments to common stockholders during both 2024 and 2023. Distributions to noncontrolling interests totaled 17 in 2024 and 10 in 2023. Hydro-Qu bec made cash contributions to Dana TM4 of 18 in both 2024 and 2023. During 2024, we received 11 from Hydro-Qu bec, which represents deferred purchase consideration associated with their acquisition of a 45 ownership interest in SME S.p.A. from Dana.
