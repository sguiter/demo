 The carrying value of cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the low level of risk these assets present and their relatively liquid nature, particularly given their short maturities. The Company also holds certain financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, including held-to-maturity securities. Held-to-maturity securities consist primarily of state and municipal bonds. The fair values of these debt securities are based on quoted market prices and yields for the same or similar securities, which the Company determined to be Level 2 inputs.

 years, with options to renew for an additional to years. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company's sole discretion and is included in the lease term for calculations of its right-of-use assets and liabilities when it is reasonably certain that the Company plans to renew these leases. Certain store lease agreements include rental payments based on a percentage of retail sales over contractual levels and others include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. Lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees, material restrictive covenants, or options to purchase the leased property. 
 
 The Company records its lease liabilities at the present value of the lease payments not yet paid, discounted at the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term. As the Company's leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, the Company obtains an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. 
 
 The Company has elected to apply the practical expedient to account for lease components (e.g. fixed payments for rent, insurance, and real estate taxes) and non-lease components (e.g. fixed payments for common area maintenance) together as a single component for all underlying asset classes. Additionally, the Company elected as an accounting policy to exclude short-term leases from the recognition requirements.

THE BUCKLE, INC. 
 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of the Company included in this Form 10-Q. All references herein to the Company, Buckle, we, us, or similar terms refer to The Buckle, Inc. and its subsidiary. The following is management s discussion and analysis of certain significant factors which have affected the Company s financial condition and results of operations during the periods included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
 
 Company management considers the following items to be key performance indicators in evaluating Company performance. 
 
 Comparable Store Sales Stores are deemed to be comparable stores if they were open in the prior year on the first day of the fiscal period being presented. Stores which have been remodeled, expanded, and/or relocated, but would otherwise be included as comparable stores, are not excluded from the comparable store sales calculation. Online sales are included in comparable store sales. Management considers comparable store sales to be an important indicator of current Company performance, helping leverage certain fixed costs when results are positive. Negative comparable store sales results could reduce net sales and have a negative impact on operating leverage, thus reducing net earnings. 
 
 Net Merchandise Margins Management evaluates the components of merchandise margin including initial markup and the amount of markdowns during a period. Any inability to obtain acceptable levels of initial markups or any significant increase in the Company s use of markdowns could have an adverse effect on the Company s gross margin and results of operations. 
 
 Operating Margin Operating margin is a good indicator for management of the Company s success. Operating margin can be positively or negatively affected by comparable store sales, merchandise margins, occupancy costs, and the Company s ability to control operating costs. 
 
 Cash Flow and Liquidity (working capital) Management reviews current cash and short-term investments along with cash flow from operating, investing, and financing activities to determine the Company s short-term cash needs for operations and expansion. The Company believes that existing cash, short-term investments, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund current and long-term anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements for the next several years. 
 
 15 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following table sets forth certain financial data expressed as a percentage of net sales and the percentage change in the dollar amount of such items compared to the prior period: 
 
 Percentage of Net Sales Percentage of Net Sales For Thirteen Weeks Ended Percentage For Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended Percentage November 2, 2024 October 28, 2023 Increase/(Decrease) November 2, 2024 October 28, 2023 Increase/(Decrease) Net sales 100.0 100.0 (3.2) 100.0 100.0 (4.6) Cost of sales (including buying, distribution, and occupancy costs) 52.3 51.5 (1.7) 53.1 52.3 (3.2) Gross profit 47.7 48.5 (4.9) 46.9 47.7 (6.1) Selling expenses 24.5 23.1 2.5 24.6 23.3 0.7 General and administrative expenses 4.6 4.3 5.4 5.0 4.5 6.3 Income from operations 18.6 21.1 (15.0) 17.3 19.9 (16.9) Other income, net 1.3 1.5 (10.4) 1.4 1.3 1.7 Income before income taxes 19.9 22.6 (14.7) 18.7 21.2 (15.7) Income tax expense 4.9 5.5 (14.7) 4.6 5.2 (15.7) Net income 15.0 17.1 (14.7) 14.1 16.0 (15.7) 
 
 Net sales decreased from 303.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 293.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, a 3.2 decrease. Comparable store net sales for the thirteen week quarter ended November 2, 2024 decreased 0.7 from comparable store net sales for the prior year thirteen week period ended November 4, 2023. Due to the 53rd week in fiscal 2023, comparable store net sales for the quarter are compared to the 13-week period ended November 4, 2023. The reduction in total sales for the period was the result of a 3.8 decrease in the number of transactions and a 0.8 decrease in the average number of units sold per transaction, which were partially offset by a 2.8 increase in the average unit retail. Online sales for the quarter increased 1.1 to 46.6 million for the thirteen week period ended November 2, 2024 compared to 46.1 million for the thirteen week period ended October 28, 2023. 
 
 Net sales decreased from 878.7 million for the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 to 838.5 million for the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, a 4.6 decrease. Comparable store net sales for the thirty-nine week period ended November 2, 2024 decreased 5.4 from comparable store net sales for the prior year thirty-nine week period ended November 4, 2023. Due to the 53rd week in fiscal 2023, comparable store net sales for the year-to-date period are compared to the 39-week period ended November 4, 2023. The reduction in total sales for the year-to-date period was the result of a 5.3 decrease in the number of transactions and a 2.6 decrease in the average number of units sold per transaction, which were partially offset by a 3.6 increase in the average unit retail. Online sales for the year-to-date period decreased 9.2 to 128.0 million for the thirty-nine week period ended November 2, 2024 compared to 141.0 million for the thirty-nine week period ended October 28, 2023. 
 
 The Company's average retail price per piece of merchandise sold increased 1.40, or 2.8 , during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. This 1.40 increase was primarily attributable to the following changes (with their corresponding effect on the overall average price per piece): a 2.0 increase in average knit shirt price points 0.23), a 0.9 increase in average denim price points 0.21), a 7.1 increase in average footwear price points 0.17), an increase in average price points for certain other merchandise categories 0.09), and a shift in the merchandise mix 0.70). These changes are primarily a reflection of merchandise shifts in terms of brands and product styles, fabrics, details, and finishes. 
 
 For the year-to-date period, the Company's average retail price per piece of merchandise sold increased 1.71, or 3.6 , compared to the same period in fiscal 2023. This 1.71 increase was primarily attributable to the following changes (with their corresponding effect on the overall average price per piece): a 1.4 increase in average knit shirt price points 0.16), a 6.5 increase in average footwear price points 0.16), a 0.7 increase in average denim price points 0.15), an increase in average price points for certain other merchandise categories 0.26), and a shift in the merchandise mix 0.98). These changes are primarily a reflection of merchandise shifts in terms of brands and product styles, fabrics, details, and finishes.

Gross profit after buying, distribution, and occupancy expenses was 140.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, compared to 147.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit was 47.7 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, compared to 48.5 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The current quarter margin decline was the result of increases in buying, distribution, and occupancy expenses (1.35 , as a percentage of net sales) which were partially offset by an improvement in merchandise margins (0.55 , as a percentage of net sales). 
 
 Year-to-date, gross profit was 393.3 million for the thirty-nine week period ended November 2, 2024, compared to 418.9 million for the thirty-nine week period ended October 28, 2023. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit was 46.9 for the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, compared to 47.7 for the first three quarters of fiscal 2023. The year-to-date margin decline was the result of increases in buying, distribution and occupancy expenses (1.35 , as a percentage of net sales) which were partially offset by an improvement in merchandise margins (0.55 , as a percentage of net sales). 
 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses were 29.1 of net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, compared to 27.4 for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase was the result of increases in store labor-related expenses (0.90 , as a percentage of net sales), digital commerce investments (0.35 , as a percentage of net sales), general and administrative salary expense (0.30 , as a percentage of net sales), and other selling, general and administrative expense categories (0.55 , as a percentage of net sales). These increases were partially offset by a reduction in expense related to incentive compensation accruals (0.40 , as a percentage of net sales). 
 
 For the 39-week year-to-date period, selling, general, and administrative expenses were 29.6 of net sales for fiscal 2024, compared to 27.8 for fiscal 2023. The increase was the result of increases in store labor-related expenses (1.05 , as a percentage of net sales), digital commerce investments (0.35 , as a percentage of net sales), general and administrative salary expense (0.30 , as a percentage of net sales), marketing spend (0.20 , as a percentage of net sales), and other selling, general and administrative expense categories (0.35 , as a percentage of net sales). These increases were partially offset by a reduction in expense related to incentive compensation accruals (0.45 , as a percentage of net sales). 
 
 As a result of the above changes, the Company's income from operations was 54.5 million, or 18.6 of net sales, for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, compared to income from operations of 64.1 million, or 21.1 of net sales, for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Income tax expense as a percentage of pre-tax income was 24.5 for the third quarter of both fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, bringing the Company's net income to 44.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 51.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. 
 
 Year-to-date, income from operations was 145.1 million for the thirty-nine week period ended November 2, 2024 compared to 174.6 million for the thirty-nine week period ended October 28, 2023. Income from operations was 17.3 of net sales for the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared to 19.9 of net sales for the first three quarters of fiscal 2023. Income tax expense as a percentage of pre-tax income was 24.5 for both the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, bringing year-to-date net income to 118.3 million for fiscal 2024 compared to 140.3 million for fiscal 2023. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 As of November 2, 2024, the Company had working capital of 292.2 million, including 302.0 million of cash and cash equivalents and 23.5 million of short-term investments. The Company's cash receipts are generated from retail sales and from investment income, and the Company's primary ongoing cash requirements are for inventory, payroll, occupancy costs, dividend payments, new store expansion, remodeling, and other capital expenditures. Historically, the Company's primary source of working capital has been cash flow from operations. During the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, the Company's cash flow from operations was 121.2 million and 145.3 million, respectively. Changes in operating cash flow between periods is primarily a function of changes in net income, along with changes in inventory and accounts payable based on the timing and amount of merchandise purchased in each respective period. Operating cash flow is also impacted by the timing of certain other payments, including rent, income taxes, and annual incentive bonuses. The Company's reduction in operating cash flow for the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared to the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 is primarily attributable to the reduction in net income, partially offset by the impact of changes in inventory and accounts payable as the Company continued to manage and adjust to changing trends. 
 
 The uses of cash for both thirty-nine week periods primarily include payment of annual bonuses accrued at fiscal year end, inventory purchases, dividend payments, construction costs for new and remodeled stores, other capital expenditures, and purchases of investment securities. 

17 

During the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 and 2023, the Company invested 31.7 million and 27.0 million, respectively, in new store construction, store renovation, and store technology upgrades. The Company also spent 0.8 million and 1.0 million in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively, in capital expenditures for the corporate headquarters and distribution facility. 
 
 During the remainder of fiscal 2024, the Company anticipates completing 1 new store and an additional 7 full store remodels. Management estimates that total capital expenditures during fiscal 2024 will be approximately 36.0 to 40.0 million, which includes primarily planned store projects and technology investments. The Company believes that existing cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund current and long-term anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements for the next several years. The Company has a consistent record of generating positive cash flow from operations each year and, as of November 2, 2024, had total cash and investments of 352.7 million, including 27.3 million of long-term investments. 
 
 Future conditions, however, may reduce the availability of funds based upon factors such as a decrease in demand for the Company's product, change in product mix, competitive factors, and general economic conditions as well as other risks and uncertainties which would reduce the Company's sales, net profitability, and cash flows. Also, the Company's acceleration in store openings and/or remodels or the Company entering into a merger, acquisition, or other financial related transaction could reduce the amount of cash available for further capital expenditures and working capital requirements. 
 
 The Company has available an unsecured line of credit of 25.0 million with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. for operating needs and letters of credit. The line of credit agreement has an expiration date of July 31, 2025 and provides that 10.0 million of the 25.0 million line is available for letters of credit. Borrowings under the line of credit provide for interest to be paid at a rate based on SOFR. The Company has, from time to time, borrowed against these lines of credit. There were no bank borrowings during the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 or 2023. The Company had no bank borrowings as of November 2, 2024 and was in compliance with the terms and conditions of the line of credit agreement. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon The Buckle, Inc. s condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statement date, and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates its estimates, including those related to inventory, investments, incentive bonuses, and income taxes. Management bases its estimates on past experience and on various other factors that are thought to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes that the estimates and judgments used in preparing these consolidated financial statements were the most appropriate at that time. Presented below are those critical accounting policies that management believes require subjective and/or complex judgments that could potentially affect reported results of operations. The critical accounting policies and estimates utilized by the Company in the preparation of its condensed consolidated financial statements for the period ended November 2, 2024 have not changed materially from those utilized for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024, included in The Buckle Inc. s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 1. Revenue Recognition . Retail store sales are recorded, net of expected returns, upon the purchase of merchandise by customers. Online sales are recorded, net of expected returns, when merchandise is tendered for delivery to the common carrier. Shipping fees charged to customers are included in revenue and shipping costs are included in selling expenses. The Company recognizes revenue from sales made under its layaway program upon delivery of the merchandise to the customer. Revenue is not recorded when gift cards and gift certificates are sold, but rather when a card or certificate is redeemed for merchandise. A current liability for unredeemed gift cards and certificates is recorded at the time the card or certificate is purchased. The liability recorded for unredeemed gift cards and gift certificates was 12.6 million and 16.7 million as of November 2, 2024 and February 3, 2024, respectively. Gift card and gift certificate breakage is recognized as revenue in proportion to the redemption pattern of customers by applying an estimated breakage rate. The estimated breakage rate is based on historical issuance and redemption patterns and is re-assessed by the Company on a regular basis. Sales tax collected from customers is excluded from revenue and is included as part of accrued store operating expenses on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 18 

The Company establishes a liability for estimated merchandise returns, based upon the historical average sales return percentage, that is recognized at the transaction value. The Company also recognizes a return asset and a corresponding adjustment to cost of sales for the Company's right to recover returned merchandise, which is measured at the estimated carrying value, less any expected recovery costs. Customer returns could potentially exceed the historical average, thus reducing future net sales results and potentially reducing future net earnings. The accrued liability for reserve for sales returns was 3.6 million as of November 2, 2024 and 2.6 million as of February 3, 2024. 
 
 The Company's Buckle Rewards program allows participating guests to earn points for every qualifying purchase, which (after achievement of certain point thresholds) are redeemable as a discount off a future purchase. In addition, through partnership with Bread Financial and Comenity Bank (collectively the "Bank"), the Company offers a private label credit card ("PLCC") program. Buckle Rewards members with a PLCC earn additional points under the Buckle Rewards program for every qualifying purchase on their PLCC card. Reported revenue is net of both current period reward redemptions and accruals for estimated future rewards earned under the Buckle Rewards program. A liability has been recorded for future rewards based on the Company's estimate of how many earned points will turn into rewards and ultimately be redeemed prior to expiration. As of November 2, 2024 and February 3, 2024, 10.0 million and 10.4 million was included in accrued store operating expenses as a liability for estimated future rewards. 
 
 2. Inventory . Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using an average cost method that approximates the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Management makes adjustments to inventory and cost of goods sold, based upon estimates, to account for merchandise obsolescence and markdowns that could affect net realizable value, based on assumptions using calculations applied to current inventory levels within each different markdown level. Management also reviews the levels of inventory in each markdown group and the overall aging of the inventory versus the estimated future demand for such product and the current market conditions. Such judgments could vary significantly from actual results, either favorably or unfavorably, due to fluctuations in future economic conditions, industry trends, consumer demand, and the competitive retail environment. Such changes in market conditions could negatively impact the sale of markdown inventory, causing further markdowns or inventory obsolescence, resulting in increased cost of goods sold from write-offs and reducing the Company s net earnings. The adjustment to inventory for markdowns and/or obsolescence was 11.2 million as of November 2, 2024 and 9.1 million as of February 3, 2024. 
 
 3. Income Taxes . The Company records a deferred tax asset and liability for expected future tax consequences resulting from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. The Company considers future taxable income and ongoing tax planning in assessing the value of its deferred tax assets. If the Company determines that it is more than likely that these assets will not be realized, the Company would reduce the value of these assets to their expected realizable value, thereby decreasing net income. Estimating the value of these assets is based upon the Company s judgment. If the Company subsequently determined that the deferred tax assets, which had been written down, would be realized in the future, such value would be increased. Adjustment would be made to increase net income in the period such determination was made. 
 
 4. Leases . The Company's lease portfolio is primarily comprised of leases for retail store locations. The Company also leases certain equipment and corporate office space. Store leases for new stores typically have an initial term of 10 years, with options to renew for an additional 1 to 5 years. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company's sole discretion and is included in the lease term for calculations of its right-of-use assets and liabilities when it is reasonably certain that the Company plans to renew these leases. Certain store lease agreements include rental payments based on a percentage of retail sales over contractual levels and others include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. Lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees, material restrictive covenants, or options to purchase the leased property. 
 
 The Company records its lease liabilities at the present value of the lease payments not yet paid, discounted at the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term. As the Company's leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, the Company obtains an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. 
 
 The Company has elected to apply the practical expedient to account for lease components (e.g. fixed payments for rent, insurance, and real estate taxes) and non-lease components (e.g. fixed payments for common area maintenance) together as a single component for all underlying asset classes. Additionally, the Company elected as an accounting policy to exclude short-term leases from the recognition requirements. 
 
 19 

5. Investments . Investments classified as short-term investments include securities with a maturity of greater than three months and less than one year. Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity (net of the effect of income taxes), using the specific identification method, until they are sold. Held-to-maturity securities are reported at amortized cost. Trading securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings, using the specific identification method. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS 
 
 As referenced in the table below, the Company has contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect the financial condition of the Company. Based on management s review of the terms and conditions of its contractual obligations and commercial commitments, there is no known trend, demand, commitment, event, or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur which would have a material effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, the commercial obligations and commitments made by the Company are customary transactions which are similar to those of other comparable retail companies. 
 
 The following table identifies the material obligations and commitments as of November 2, 2024: 
 
 Payments Due by Fiscal Year Contractual obligations (dollar amounts in thousands): Total 2024 (remaining) 2025-2026 2027-2028 Thereafter Purchase obligations 20,702 11,452 6,658 2,576 16 Deferred compensation 27,261 27,261 Operating lease payments (a) 
 394,210 26,924 160,626 82,954 123,706 Total contractual obligations 442,173 38,376 167,284 85,530 150,983 
 (a) See Footnote 6 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 The Company has available an unsecured line of credit of 25.0 million, which is excluded from the preceding table. The line of credit agreement has an expiration date of July 31, 2025 and provides that 10.0 million of the 25.0 million line is available for letters of credit. Certain merchandise purchase orders require that the Company open letters of credit. When the Company takes possession of the merchandise, it releases payment on the letters of credit. The amounts of outstanding letters of credit reported reflect the open letters of credit on merchandise ordered, but not yet received or funded. The Company believes it has sufficient credit available to open letters of credit for merchandise purchases. There were no bank borrowings during the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 or the first three quarters of fiscal 2023. The Company had outstanding letters of credit totaling 3.1 million and 3.2 million as of November 2, 2024 and February 3, 2024, respectively. The Company has no other off-balance sheet arrangements. 

SEASONALITY 
 
 The Company's business is seasonal, with the holiday season (from approximately November 15 to December 30) and the back-to-school season (from approximately July 15 to September 1) historically contributing the greatest volume of net sales. For fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, the holiday and back-to-school seasons accounted for approximately 35 of the Company's fiscal year net sales. Quarterly results may vary significantly depending on a variety of factors including the timing and amount of sales and costs associated with the opening of new stores, the timing and level of markdowns, the timing of store closings, the remodeling of existing stores, competitive factors, and general economic conditions. 
 
 20 

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 Information in this report, other than historical information, may be considered to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the 1995 Act ). Such statements are made in good faith by the Company pursuant to the safe-harbor provisions of the 1995 Act. In connection with these safe-harbor provisions, this management s discussion and analysis contains certain forward-looking statements, which reflect management s current views and estimates of future economic conditions, Company performance, and financial results. The statements are based on many assumptions and factors that could cause future results to differ materially. Such factors include, but are not limited to, changes in product mix, changes in fashion trends, competitive factors, and general economic conditions, economic conditions in the retail apparel industry, as well as other risks and uncertainties inherent in the Company s business and the retail industry in general. Any changes in these factors could result in significantly different results for the Company. The Company further cautions that the forward-looking information contained herein is not exhaustive or exclusive. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements, which may be made from time to time by or on behalf of the Company. 

ITEM 3 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Interest Rate Risk - The Company is exposed to market risk related to interest rate risk on the cash and investments in interest-bearing securities. These investments have carrying values that are subject to interest rate changes that could impact earnings to the extent that the Company did not hold the investments to maturity. If there are changes in interest rates, those changes would also affect the investment income the Company earns on its cash and investments. For each one-quarter percent decline in the interest/dividend rate earned on cash and investments, the Company s net income would decrease approximately 0.5 million, or less than 0.01 per share. This amount could vary based upon the number of shares of the Company s stock outstanding and the level of cash and investments held by the Company. 

ITEM 4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 The Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that material information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely manner. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act )) was performed as of the end of the period covered by this report. This evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. 
 
 Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the Company s reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC s rules and forms. 
 
 Change in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company's last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
