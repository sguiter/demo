Ending balance 

During the six-month periods ended October 27, 2024, and October 29, 2023, we assessed the credit risk of our customers within our accounts receivable portfolio. Our risk assessment includes the respective customers (i) financial position; (ii) past payment history; (iii) management s general ability; and (iv) historical loss experience; as well as (v) any other ongoing economic conditions. After our risk assessment was completed, we assigned credit grades to our customers, which in turn, were used to determine our allowance for doubtful accounts totaling and as of October 27, 2024, and October 29, 2023, respectively. 

business segments: mattress fabrics and upholstery fabrics. The mattress fabrics segment manufactures, sources, and sells fabrics and mattress covers primarily to bedding manufacturers. The upholstery fabrics segment develops, sources, manufactures, and sells fabrics primarily to residential, commercial, and hospitality furniture manufacturers. In addition, the upholstery fabrics segment includes Read Window Products LLC Read ), which provides window treatments and sourcing of upholstery fabrics and other products, as well as measuring and installation services for Read s products, to customers in the hospitality and commercial industries. Read also supplies soft goods such as decorative top sheets, coverlets, duvet covers, bed skirts, bolsters, and pillows. Our primary performance obligations include the sale of mattress fabrics and upholstery fabrics, as well as the performance of customized fabrication and installation services for Read s products associated with window treatments. Contract Assets Liabilities Certain contracts, primarily those for customized fabrication and installation services associated with Read, require payments in advance in the form of customer deposits that result in a contract liability which is recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as deferred revenue. If payments in advance are not required, customers may be granted terms which generally range from - days. Our terms are customary within the industries in which we operate and are not considered financing arrangements. There were contract assets recognized as of October 27, 2024, October 29, 2023, or April 28, 2024.

Measurement of Inventory to Net Realizable Value 

 I- 10 

for the six months ended October 27, 2024, related to adjustments made to our inventory markdowns reserve estimated based on our policy for aged inventory for both the mattress and upholstery fabrics segments. We recorded a non-cash inventory credit of million for the six months ended October 29, 2023. The non-cash inventory credit of million represented a million credit related to adjustments made to our inventory markdown reserve estimated based on our policy for aged inventory for both our mattress and upholstery fabrics segments, partially offset by a net restructuring related charge of . This net restructuring related charge represented markdowns of inventory totaling during the first quarter of fiscal 2024, partially offset by a gain on disposal of inventory totaling during the second quarter of fiscal 2024, both of which related to the discontinuation of production of cut and sewn upholstery kits at our facility in Ouanaminthe, Haiti during the respective periods. Of the million non-cash inventory credit for the first half of fiscal 2024, million and pertained to our mattress fabrics and upholstery fabrics segments, respectively. Assessment As of October 27, 2024, we reviewed our mattress fabrics and upholstery fabrics inventories to determine if any additional write-downs, in excess of the amount recorded based on our policy for aged inventory, were necessary. Based on our assessment, no additional write-downs of inventories to their net realizable value were recorded for the six months ended October 27, 2024, other than the markdowns of inventory associated with our restructuring activities described in Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements. Based on the current unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, it is possible that estimates used by management to determine the write down of inventory to its net realizable value could be materially different from the actual amounts or our results. These differences could result in higher than expected inventory provisions, which could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition in the near term.

Tradename Our tradename pertains to Read, a separate reporting unit within the upholstery fabrics segment. This tradename was determined to have an indefinite useful life at the time of its acquisition, and therefore is not being amortized. However, we are required to assess this tradename annually or between annual tests if we believe indicators of impairment exist. Based on our assessment as of October 27, 2024, no indicators of impairment existed, and therefore we did t record any asset impairment charges associated with our tradename through the second quarter of fiscal 2025.

Our non-compete agreement is associated with a prior acquisition by our mattress fabrics segment and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the agreement. The gross carrying amount of our non-compete agreement was million as of October 27, 2024, October 29, 2023, and April 28, 2024, respectively. Accumulated amortization for our non-compete agreement was million, million, and million as of October 27, 2024, October 29, 2023, and April 28, 2024, respectively. The remaining amortization expense for the next five years and thereafter follows: FY 2025 - ; FY 2026 - ; FY 2027 - ; FY 2028 - . The weighted average amortization period for the non-compete agreement was years as of October 27, 2024. Impairment of Definite Lived Assets - Mattress Fabrics Segment As of October 27, 2024, management reviewed the long-lived assets associated with our mattress fabrics segment, which consisted of property, plant, and equipment, right of use assets, and definite-lived intangible assets (collectively known as the "Mattress Asset Group"), for impairment, as events and changes in circumstances occurred that indicated the carrying amount of the Mattress Asset Group may not be recoverable. The mattress fabrics segment experienced a significant cumulative operating loss totaling million commencing in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, and continuing through the second quarter of fiscal 2025. We believe this significant cumulative operating loss stemmed from a decline in consumer discretionary spending on mattress products, which we believe was driven by the following factors: (i) inflationary effects of commodities such as gas, food, and other necessities; (ii) a significant increase in interest rates; (iii) the pulling forward of demand for home goods products during the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic, which demand has now shifted to travel, leisure, and other services; and (iv) excess inventory held by customers due to the decline in consumer demand. Based on the above evidence, we were required to determine the recoverability of the Mattress Asset Group, which is classified as held and used, by comparing the carrying amount of the Mattress Asset Group to the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset group. The carrying amount of the Mattress Asset Group totaled million, which represents property, plant, and equipment of million, right of use assets of , customer relationships of , and a non-compete agreement of . The total carrying amount of the Mattress Asset Group did not exceed the sum of its future undiscounted cash flows from its use and disposition. As a result, we determined there was impairment associated with the Mattress Asset Group as of October 27, 2024.

million for the full amount of rent due prior to the commencement of the Original Lease, and the initial lease term was set to expire on . Pursuant to the terms of the Termination Agreement, the Original Lease was formally terminated when CUF Haiti vacated and returned possession of the leased facility to the lessor. After CUF Haiti vacated and returned possession of the leased facility, a third party (the Lessee took possession of this facility, and the Lessee agreed to pay CUF Haiti million in the form of a note receivable over a period commencing on April 1, 2023, and ending on December 31, 2029, based on the terms stated in the Termination Agreement. In connection with Termination Agreement, an affiliate of the Lessee has guaranteed payment in full of all amounts due and payable to CUF Haiti by the Lessee, and CUF Haiti has been fully and unconditionally discharged from all of its remaining obligations under the Original Lease. As of the end of our third quarter of fiscal 2023, the carrying amount of the note receivable totaling million was recorded at its fair value of million, which represented the present value of future discounted cash flows based on the payment amounts and timing of such payments due from the Lessee as stated in the Termination Agreement. We used an interest rate of to determine the present value of the future discounted cash flows, based on significant unobservable inputs and assumptions determined by management such as (i) the credit characteristics of the Lessee and guarantor of the Termination Agreement; (ii) the length of the payment terms as defined in the Termination Agreement; (iii) the payment terms as defined in the Termination Agreement being denominated in USD; and (iv) the fact that the facility is located in, and the Lessee and guarantor conduct business in, Haiti, a foreign country. Since management used significant unobservable inputs and assumptions to determine the fair value of this note receivable, this note receivable was classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy (see Note 12 for further explanation of the fair value hierarchy). Effective May 1, 2024, CUF Haiti formally assigned the million note receivable to Culp, Inc. (its U.S. Parent).

Mattress Fabrics Segment - Canada 

The carrying values of these assets held for sale totaling million are presented separately on the October 27, 2024, consolidated balance sheet and are no longer being depreciated. During the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we determined that the carrying value of the assets classified as held for sale were less than or equal to their fair value. The fair value used in the determination was based on quoted market prices and from third party buyer sales offers which are either directly or indirectly observable, and therefore we believe are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy (see Note 12 for further explanation of the fair value hierarchy). Consequently, we did not have to record an impairment loss on these assets.

million, of which approximately million is expected to be cash expenditures. The million of estimated restructuring and restructuring related charges represents approximately million and associated with the mattress fabrics and upholstery fabrics segments, respectively. The million of estimated restructuring and restructuring related charges associated with our mattress fabrics segment represents (i) other associated costs of million mostly related to relocating equipment from our facility in Quebec, Canada to our facility in Stokesdale, NC, (ii) additional depreciation expense related to the shortening of useful lives of equipment associated with the gradual discontinuance of our operations located in Canada noted above totaling million, (iii) employee termination benefits of million, (iv) million related to losses on disposal and valuation of inventory, and (v) lease termination costs of , (vi) partially offset by net gains on the disposal of equipment totaling . These restructuring and restructuring related charges exclude any expected gain on the sale of real estate associated with the closure of the Canadian facility, the amount of which is currently undetermined but which will ultimately reduce the amount of the restructuring charges incurred. Based on management's internal analysis we expect cash proceeds from the sale of real estate (net of all taxes and commissions) to exceed the amount of cash restructuring charges incurred. Based on changes in business and current industry economic conditions, it is possible that the above estimates provided by management to determine restructuring and restructuring related charges incurred during fiscal 2025, and proceeds generated from the sale of the manufacturing facility located in Quebec, Canada, could be materially different from our actual results, and therefore could adversely affect the success of this restructuring plan.

 Ouanaminthe, Haiti Cut and Sew Upholstery Fabrics Operation During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, Culp Upholstery Fabrics Haiti, Ltd. ("CUF Haiti") entered into an agreement to terminate a lease associated with a facility, and in turn moved the production of upholstery cut and sewn kits to an existing facility leased by Culp Home Fashions Haiti, Ltd. ("CHF Haiti") during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Both CUF Haiti and CHF Haiti are indirectly wholly-owned subsidiaries of the company. During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, demand for upholstery cut and sewn kits declined more than previously anticipated, resulting in the strategic action to discontinue the production of upholstery cut and sew kits in Haiti.

, or of loss before income taxes, for the six-month period ending October 27, 2024, compared with income tax expense of million, or of loss before income taxes, for the six-month period ending October 29, 2023. Our effective income tax rates for the six-month periods ended October 27, 2024, and October 29, 2023, were based upon the estimated effective income tax rate applicable for the full year after giving effect to any significant items related specifically to interim periods. When calculating the annual estimated effective income tax rates for the six-month periods ended October 27, 2024, and October 29, 2023, we were subject to loss limitation rules. These loss limitation rules require any taxable loss associated with our U.S. or foreign operations to be excluded from the annual estimated effective income tax rate calculation if it was determined that no income tax benefit could be recognized during the current fiscal year. The effective income tax rate can be affected over the fiscal year by the mix and timing of actual earnings from our U.S. operations and foreign subsidiaries located in China, Canada, Haiti, and Vietnam versus annual projections, as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar.

Our consolidated effective income tax rates for the first half of fiscal 2025 and the first half of fiscal 2024 were both adversely affected by the mix of earnings between our U.S. operations and foreign subsidiaries, as our taxable income stems mostly from our operations located in China, which has a higher income tax rate than the U.S. In addition, during the first half of fiscal 2025 and the first half of 2024, we incurred pre-tax losses associated with our U.S. operations, for which an income tax benefit was not recorded due to a full valuation allowance applied against our U.S. net deferred income tax assets. The income tax charge associated with the full valuation allowance applied against our U.S. net deferred income tax assets was higher during the first half of fiscal 2025 compared with the first half of fiscal 2024, as our million U.S. pre-tax loss incurred during the first half of fiscal 2025 was significantly greater than the million U.S. pre-tax loss incurred during the first half of fiscal 2024. During the first half of fiscal 2025, we incurred a greater consolidated pre-tax loss totaling million, compared with million during the first half of fiscal 2024. As a result, the principal differences between income tax expense at the U.S. federal income tax rate and the effective income tax rate reflected in the consolidated financial statements were more pronounced during the first half of fiscal 2024, as compared with the first half of fiscal 2025. U.S. Valuation Allowance We evaluate the realizability of our U.S. net deferred income tax assets to determine if a valuation allowance is required. We assess whether a valuation allowance should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more-likely-than-not standard, with significant weight being given to evidence that can be objectively verified. Since the company operates in multiple jurisdictions, we assess the need for a valuation allowance on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, considering the effects of local tax law.

U.S. capital loss carryforward 

Undistributed Earnings We assess whether the undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries will be reinvested indefinitely or eventually distributed to our U.S. parent company and whether we are required to record a deferred income tax liability for those undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries that will not be reinvested indefinitely. As of October 27, 2024, we assessed the liquidity requirements of our U.S. parent company and determined that our undistributed earnings and profits from our foreign subsidiaries would not be reinvested indefinitely and would eventually be distributed to our U.S. parent company. The conclusion reached from this assessment was consistent with prior reporting periods. As a result of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a U.S. corporation is allowed a dividend received deduction for earnings and profits received from a owned foreign corporation. Therefore, a deferred income tax liability will be required only for unremitted withholding taxes associated with earnings and profits generated by our foreign subsidiaries that will ultimately be repatriated to the U.S. parent company. As a result, as of October 27, 2024, October 29, 2023, and April 28, 2024, we recorded a deferred income tax liabi lity of mi llion, million, and million, respectively. Uncertain Income Tax Positions An unrecognized income tax benefit for an uncertain income tax position can be recognized in the first interim period if the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is met by the end of the reporting period, or is effectively settled through examination, negotiation, or litigation, or the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine and challenge the tax position has expired. If it is determined that any of the above conditions occur regarding our uncertain income tax positions, an adjustment to our unrecognized income tax benefit will be recorded at that time. As of October 27, 2024, October 29 , 2023, and April 28, 2024 we had a million, million, and million total of gross unrecognized income tax benefits, of which the entire amount was classified as income taxes payable long-term in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of October 27, 2024, the unrecognized tax benefit would favorably affect income tax expense in future periods by million. Our gross unrecognized income tax benefit of million as o f October 27, 2024, relates to income tax positions for which significant change could occur within the next year if the statute of limitations for relevant taxing authorities to examine and challenge the tax position expires.

Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units We grant performance-based restricted stock units to senior executives which could earn up to a certain number of shares of common stock if certain performance targets are met over a three-fiscal year performance period as defined in the related restricted stock unit award agreements. The number of shares of common stock that are earned based on performance targets that have been achieved may be adjusted based on a market-based total shareholder return component as defined in the related restricted stock unit award agreements. Our performance-based restricted stock units granted to senior executives were measured based on their fair market value on the date of grant. The fair market value per share was determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model for the market-based total shareholder return component and the closing price of our common stock for the performance-based component.

As of October 27, 2024, the statutory surplus reserve fund represents the registered capital requirement, and therefore, our subsidiary located in China is no longer required to transfer of its net income in accordance with PRC accounting rules and regulations. The transfer to this reserve must be made before distributions of any dividend to shareholders. As of October 27, 2024, the company s statutory surplus reserve was million. The statutory surplus reserve fund is non-distributable other than during liquidation and can be used to fund previous years losses, if any. The statutory surplus reserve fund may be utilized for business expansion or converted into share capital by issuing new shares to existing shareholders in proportion to their shareholding or by increasing the par value of the shares currently held by them provided that the remaining reserve balance after such issue is not less than of the registered capital.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNI NG FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 
 This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934). Such statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events and results to differ materially from such statements. Forward-looking statements are statements that include projections, expectations, or beliefs about future events or results or otherwise are not statements of historical fact. Such statements are often but not always characterized by qualifying words such as expect, believe, will, may, should, could, potential, continue, target, predict , seek, anticipate, estimate, intend, plan, project, and their derivatives, and include but are not limited to statements about expectations, projections, or trends for our future operations, strategic initiatives and plans, restructuring actions, production levels, new product launches, sales, profit margins, profitability, operating (loss) income, capital expenditures, working capital levels, cost savings (including, without limitation, anticipated cost savings from restructuring actions), income taxes, SG A or other expenses, pre-tax (loss) income, earnings, cash flow, and other performance or liquidity measures, as well as any statements regarding dividends, share repurchases, liquidity, use of cash and cash requirements, ending cash balances and cash positions, borrowing capacity, investments, potential acquisitions, cash and non-cash restructuring and restructuring-related charges, expenses, and/or credits, net proceeds from restructuring-related asset dispositions, future economic or industry trends, public health epidemics, or future developments. There can be no assurance that we will realize these expectations or meet our guidance, or that these beliefs will prove correct. 
 Factors that could influence the matters discussed in such statements include the level of housing starts and sales of existing homes, consumer confidence, trends in disposable income, and general economic conditions. Decreases in these economic indicators could have a negative effect on our business and prospects. Likewise, increases in interest rates, particularly home mortgage rates, and increases in consumer debt or the general rate of inflation, could affect us adversely. The future performance of our business depends in part on our success in conducting and finalizing acquisition negotiations and integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations. Changes in consumer tastes or preferences toward products not produced by us could erode demand for our products. Changes in tariffs or trade policy, including changes in U.S. trade enforcement priorities, or changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies, could affect our financial results because a significant portion of our operations are located outside the United States. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies could make our products less competitive on the basis of price in markets outside the United States, and strengthening of currencies in Canada and China can have a negative impact on our sales of products produced in those places. In addition, because our foreign operations use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, changes in the exchange rate between the local currency of those operations and the U.S dollar can affect our reported profits from those foreign operations. Also, economic or political instability in international areas could affect our operations or sources of goods in those areas, as well as demand for our products in international markets. The impact of public health epidemics on employees, customers, suppliers, and the global economy, such as the recent coronavirus pandemic, could also adversely affect our operations and financial performance. In addition, the impact of potential asset impairments, including impairments of property, plant, and equipment, inventory, or intangible assets, as well as the impact of valuation allowances applied against our net deferred income tax assets, could affect our financial results. Increases in freight costs, labor costs, and raw material prices, including increases in market prices for petrochemical products, can also significantly affect the prices we pay for shipping, labor, and raw materials, respectively, and in turn, increase our operating costs and decrease our profitability. Also, our success in diversifying our supply chain with reliable partners to effectively service our global platform could affect our operations and adversely affect our financial results. Finally, the future performance of our business also depends on our ability to successfully restructure our mattress fabric operations and return the segment to profitability. Further information about these factors, as well as other factors that could affect our future operations or financial results and the matters discussed in forward-looking statements, is included in Item 1A Risk Factors in our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 Many of these factors are macroeconomic in nature and are, therefore, beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results, performance or achievements may vary materially from those described in this report as anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended, planned or projected. The forward-looking statements included in this report are made only as of the date of of this report. Unless required by United States federal securities laws, we neither intend nor assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this report to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations. A forward-looking statement is neither a prediction nor a guarantee of future events or circumstances, and those future events or circumstances may not occur. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know about or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also affect our business operations or financial results.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes and other exhibits included elsewhere in this report. 
 General 
 Our fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period ending on the Sunday closest to April 30. The six months ended October 27, 2024, and October 29, 2023, both represent 26-week periods. 
 Our operations are classified into two business segments: mattress fabrics and upholstery fabrics. 
 Mattress Fabrics 
 The mattress fabrics segment manufactures, sources, and sells fabrics and mattress covers primarily to bedding manufacturers. Currently, we have mattress fabric manufacturing operations located in Stokesdale, North Carolina, and Quebec, Canada. We also have a mattress cover operation located in Ouanaminthe, Haiti. 
 On April 29, 2024 (the first quarter of fiscal 2025), our board of directors made a decision to (1) consolidate the company's North American mattress fabrics operations, including a gradual discontinuation of operations and sale of the company's manufacturing facility located in Quebec, Canada; (2) move a portion of the knitting and finishing capacity from the company's manufacturing facility located in Quebec, Canada to the company's manufacturing facility located in Stokesdale, North Carolina; (3) transition the mattress fabrics segment's weaving operation to a strategic sourcing model through the company's long standing supply partners; and (4) consolidate the company's sewn mattress cover operation located in Ouanaminthe, Haiti, from two leased facilities into one building and reduce other operating expenses at this location. See Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our restructuring activities. 
 Upholstery Fabrics 
 The upholstery fabrics segment develops, sources, manufactures, and sells fabrics primarily to residential, commercial, and hospitality furniture manufacturers. We have upholstery fabric operations located in Shanghai, China, and Burlington, North Carolina. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we established a wholly owned subsidiary, Culp Fabrics Vietnam Limited, with an administrative office located in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, for the purpose of enhancing our strategic sourcing opportunities and to further diversify our supply chain in Asia. 
 Additionally, Read Window Products, LLC Read ), a wholly owned subsidiary with operations located in Knoxville, Tennessee, and Burlington, North Carolina (established during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 within an existing upholstery fabrics facility) provides window treatments and sourcing of upholstery fabrics and other products, as well as measuring and installation services for Read s products, to customers in the hospitality and commercial industries. Read also supplies soft goods such as decorative top sheets, coverlets, duvet covers, bed skirts, bolsters, and pillows. 
 Executive Summary 
 We evaluate the operating performance of our business segments based upon (loss) income from operations before certain unallocated corporate expenses and other items that are not expected to occur on a regular basis. Cost of sales for each business segment includes costs to develop, manufacture, or source our products, including costs such as raw material and finished good purchases, direct and indirect labor, overhead, and incoming freight charges. Unallocated corporate expenses primarily represent compensation and benefits for certain executive officers and their support staff, all costs associated with being a public company, amortization of intangible assets, and other miscellaneous expenses.

Net Sales 
 Overall, our consolidated net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 decreased by 5.2 compared with the same period a year ago, with mattress fabrics sales decreasing 4.2 and upholstery fabrics sales decreasing 6.4 . Our consolidated net sales for the first half of fiscal 2025 decreased by 2.8 compared with the same period a year ago, with mattress fabrics sale decreasing 4.0 and upholstery fabrics sales decreasing 1.3 . 
 The decrease in net sales for our mattress fabrics segment for both the second quarter and the first half of fiscal 2025, as compared to the prior-year periods, reflects reduced demand as a result of weakness in the domestic mattress industry. The decrease in net sales for our upholstery fabrics segment for both the second quarter and the first half of fiscal 2025, as compared to the prior-year periods, reflects reduced demand for our residential upholstery fabric products due to weakness in the residential home furnishings industry. 
 See the Segment Analysis section below for further details. 
 Loss Before Income Taxes 
 Overall, our loss before income taxes for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was (5.7) million, compared with loss before income taxes of (1.9) million for the prior-year period, while our loss before income taxes for the first six months of fiscal 2025 was (12.7) million, compared with loss before income taxes of (4.5) million for the prior-year period. 
 Operating performance for both the second quarter and the first half of fiscal 2025, as compared to the prior-year periods, was negatively affected by lower sales and by manufacturing inefficiencies primarily related to the significant restructuring activity underway in the mattress fabrics segment, along with restructuring and restructuring related charges during both periods 2.8 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to 66,000 during the second quarter of fiscal 2024, and 5.5 million during the first half of fiscal 2025, as compared to 583,000 during the first half of fiscal 2024). 
 See the Segment Analysis section below for further details. 
 I- 35 

Income Taxes 
 We recorded income tax expense of 190,000, or (1.5 of loss before income taxes, for the six-month period ended October 27, 2024, compared with income tax expense of 1.2 million, or (26.8 of loss before income taxes, for the six-month period ended October 29, 2023. 
 
 Our consolidated effective income tax rates for the first half of fiscal 2025 and the first half of fiscal 2024 were both adversely affected by the mix of earnings between our U.S. operations and foreign subsidiaries, as our taxable income stems mostly from our operations located in China, which has a higher income tax rate than the U.S. In addition, during the first half of fiscal 2025 and the first half of fiscal 2024, we incurred pre-tax losses associated with our U.S. operations, for which an income tax benefit was not recorded due to a full valuation allowance applied against our U.S. net deferred income tax assets. The income tax charge associated with the full valuation allowance applied against our U.S. net deferred income tax assets was higher during the first half of fiscal 2025 compared with the first half of fiscal 2024, as our (12.4) million U.S. pre-tax loss incurred during the first half of fiscal 2025 was significantly greater than the (5.8) million U.S. pre-tax loss incurred during the first half of fiscal 2024. 
 
 During the first half of fiscal 2025, we incurred a greater consolidated pre-tax loss totaling (12.7) million, compared with (4.5) million during the first half of fiscal 2024. As a result, the principal differences between income tax expense at the U.S. federal income tax rate and the effective income tax rate reflected in the consolidated financial statements were more pronounced during the first half of fiscal 2024, as compared with the first half of fiscal 2025. 
 Refer to Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our provision for income taxes. 
 Liquidity 
 As of October 27, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents (collectively, cash totaled 10.5 million, which represents a slight increase compared with cash of 10.0 million as of April 28, 2024. This increase was mostly due to 4.0 million in cash proceeds from borrowings on a line of credit associated with our operations located in China and 527,000 in cash proceeds from the sale of equipment associated with our restructuring activities, mostly offset by 1.6 million in capital expenditures and 2.6 million of net cash used in operating activities. 
 Our net cash used in operating activities was 2.6 million during the first half of fiscal 2025, a decrease of 1.9 million compared with net cash used in operating activities of 4.5 million during the first half of fiscal 2024. This trend mostly reflects (i) an increase in accounts payable due to an increase in inventory purchases with significant vendors who extended their terms during the first half of fiscal 2025 compared with fiscal 2024, partially offset by (ii) an increase in inventory purchases to maintain an appropriate level of inventory during the company's restructuring activities, as described below in the section titled Segment Analysis Mattress Fabrics Segment Restructuring Activities, and (iii) an increase in accounts receivable primarily due to an increase in net sales during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 As of October 27, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings totaling 4.1 million under a line of credit agreement associated with our operations located in China.

Net Sales 
 
 Mattress fabrics sales decreased 4.2 in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the prior-year period. Mattress fabrics sales decreased 4.0 in the first half of fiscal 2025 compared to the first half of fiscal 2024. 
 This decrease in net sales for our mattress fabrics segment for both the second quarter and the first half of fiscal 2025 reflects reduced demand due to weakness in the domestic mattress industry, driven by a challenging macroeconomic environment that has affected consumer discretionary spending and housing markets. 
 Based on demand trends and ongoing macroeconomic challenges, we took aggressive action during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 to bring our manufacturing costs and capacity in line with current and expected demand. We announced a major restructuring plan primarily focused on the mattress fabrics segment early in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, and we are making steady progress on the execution of this restructuring plan, which is expected to be mostly completed by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2025. See Restructuring Activities below for further details. 
 
 Looking ahead, we are diligently focused on winning new placements to increase revenue and margins. However, with no ascertainable catalysts that might be expected to drive recovery in the near term, we expect the current macroeconomic environment will continue to pressure consumer spending and housing market trends (and our net sales) for some time. In the face of these macro headwinds, we are working to manage the aspects of our business we can control, including the execution of our restructuring plan. We believe the strategic actions we are taking will position us for profitable growth opportunities, but greater macro-industry and end-consumer support will be needed to drive recovery in the mattress industry and support our future sales growth. Additionally, the potential ongoing geopolitical disruptions related to wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, as well as the potential impact of future tariffs, remain unknown and depend on factors beyond our knowledge or control. These situations could cause disruption to global markets or increased costs that could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. 
 Gross Profit, Selling, General Administrative Expenses, and Loss from Operations 
 Loss from operations was 1.0 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to loss from operations of 936,000 for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Loss from operations was 4.6 million for the first half of fiscal 2025, compared to loss from operations of 2.3 million for the first half of fiscal 2024. 
 Operating performance for both the second quarter and the first half of fiscal 2025, as compared to the prior-year periods, was pressured by lower sales volumes and manufacturing inefficiencies primarily related to our significant restructuring initiatives to gradually wind down our Canadian operation and move certain knitting equipment to our Stokesdale, North Carolina, manufacturing facility, partially offset by lower fixed costs. 
 We expect manufacturing inefficiencies related our restructuring initiatives, as well as ongoing industry softness affecting sales volumes, will affect profitability through at least the third quarter of fiscal 2025, as we work to implement our restructuring plan to align capacity with current and expected demand. However, we expect these restructuring initiatives, once fully implemented, will enable the mattress fabrics segment to grow more efficiently and profitably with a lower level of fixed costs, even at currently depressed sales levels. See Restructuring Activities below for further details. Importantly, these strategic steps do not limit our ability to grow the mattress fabrics business, but instead allow us to better optimize our global mix of manufacturing capabilities and long-term sourcing partners. We will also consider further adjustments to right-size and restructure our operations as necessary to align with current demand levels, as well as additional reasonable pricing actions as competitive conditions permit to further mitigate and manage inflation. 
 I- 37 

Restructuring Activities 
 On April 29, 2024 (first quarter of fiscal 2025), our board of directors made a decision to (1) consolidate the company's North American mattress fabrics operations, including a gradual discontinuation of operations and sale of the company's manufacturing facility located in Quebec, Canada; (2) move a portion of the knitting and finishing capacity from the company's manufacturing facility located in Quebec, Canada to the company's manufacturing facility located in Stokesdale, North Carolina; (3) transition the mattress fabrics segment's weaving operation to a strategic sourcing model through the company's long standing supply partners; and (4) consolidate the company's two leased facilities related to the sewn mattress cover operation into one facility located in Ouanaminthe, Haiti, and reduce other operating expenses at this location. 
 We expect the gradual discontinuance of operations and the closure of the facility located in Quebec, Canada, will be completed by December 31, 2024. The consolidation activity associated with the sewn mattress cover operation located in Haiti was completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2025. These actions are expected to result in restructuring and restructuring related charges for the mattress segment of approximately 7.2 million during fiscal 2025, of which approximately 4.3 million is expected to be cash expenditures. 
 The 7.2 million of estimated restructuring and restructuring related charges associated with our mattress fabrics segment represents (i) other associated costs of 2.7 million mostly related to relocating equipment from our facility in Quebec, Canada to our facility in Stokesdale, NC, (ii) additional depreciation expense related to the shortening of useful lives of equipment associated with the gradual discontinuance of our operations located in Canada noted above totaling 1.3 million, (iii) employee termination benefits of 1.3 million, (iv) 1.1 million related to losses on disposal and valuation of inventory, and (v) lease termination costs of 860,000, (vi) partially offset by net gains on the disposal of equipment totaling 110,000. These restructuring and restructuring related charges exclude any expected gain on the sale of real estate associated with the closure of the Canadian facility, the amount of which is currently undetermined but which will ultimately reduce the amount of the restructuring charges incurred. Based on management's internal analysis we expect cash proceeds from the sale of real estate (net of all taxes and commissions) to exceed the amount of cash restructuring charges incurred. 
 
 Based on changes in business and current industry economic conditions, it is possible that the above estimates provided by management to determine restructuring and restructuring related charges incurred during fiscal 2025 and proceeds generated from the sale of the manufacturing facility located in Quebec, Canada, could be materially different from our actual results, and therefore could adversely affect the success of this restructuring plan.

 Accounts Receivable 
 As of October 27, 2024, accounts receivable decreased by 951,000, or 8.4 , compared with October 29, 2023. This reflects the 4.2 decrease in net sales during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024. In addition, the decrease in accounts receivable was due to improved payment trends with larger customers during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Accordingly, days sales outstanding decreased to 31 days for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to 33 days for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 As of October 27, 2024, accounts receivable remained flat compared with April 28, 2024. This trend primarily reflects an increase in net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, offset by faster cash collections, as we experienced improved payment trends with larger customers during the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 were 30.1 million, an increase of 16.8 , compared with net sales of 25.8 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Days sales outstanding decreased to 31 days for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to 35 days for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 Inventory 
 As of October 27, 2024, inventory increased by 2.1 million, or 7.6 , compared with October 29, 2023. In connection with the restructuring activity described above in Restructuring Activities, this trend represents an increase in finished goods inventory to accommodate customers while the weaving operation is transitioned to a strategic sourcing model and knitting and finishing capacity is relocated from the manufacturing facility in Quebec, Canada, to our facility in Stokesdale, North Carolina. This increase in finished goods inventory was partially offset by lower raw material purchases related to the gradual discontinuation of operations of the company's manufacturing facility located in Quebec, Canada, as described above in Restructuring Activities, and also by the decrease in net sales described above. 
 As of October 27, 2024, inventory increased by 1.6 million, or 5.7 , compared with April 28, 2024. This increase in inventory represents an increase in net sales of 4.3 million, or 16.8 , during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. This trend is also due to the effect of the restructuring activity described in the preceding paragraph. 
 Inventory turns were 4.1 for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared with 4.5 for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and 3.6 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 Property, Plant, Equipment 
 During fiscal 2024 and continuing through the second quarter of fiscal 2025, property, plant, and equipment has steadily decreased due to reduced capital spending stemming from current unfavorable macro-economic conditions within the home furnishings and bedding industries, as well as the actions taken as described above in Restructuring Activities. 
 The 24.7 million as of October 27, 2024, represents property, plant, and equipment of 22.2 million, 1.6 million, and 889,000 located in the U.S., Canada, and Haiti, respectively. The 32.9 million as of October 29, 2023, represents property, plant, and equipment of 22.2 million, 10.0 million, and 661,000 located in the U.S., Canada, and Haiti, respectively. The 31.5 million as of April 28, 2024, represents property, plant, and equipment of 21.5 million, 9.4 million, and 555,000 located in the U.S., Canada, and Haiti, respectively. 
 I- 39 

Right of Use Assets 
 During fiscal 2024 and continuing through the second quarter of fiscal 2025, right of use assets have steadily decreased due to rent expense incurred over the terms of the existing lease agreements. In addition, in connection with the restructuring activity described above in Restructuring Activities, right of use assets (i) decreased due to the termination of an agreement to lease a facility located in Ouanaminthe, Haiti, and (ii) shortened the period of use associated with two leased facilities located in Quebec, Canada. 
 The 275,000 as of October 27, 2024, represents a right of use asset in Haiti. The 2.0 million as of October 29, 2023, represents right of use assets of 1.3 million and 663,000 located in Haiti, and Canada, respectively. The 1.6 million as of April 28, 2024, represents right of use assets of 1.1 million and 545,000 located in Haiti and Canada, respectively. 
 Assets Held for Sale 
 As of October 27, 2024, and in connection with actions described above in Restructuring Activities, we classified certain equipment relating to both our U.S. and Canadian operations and our building located in Quebec, Canada, as held for sale. The 3.3 million represents assets held for sale of 2.9 million and 358,000 located in Canada and the U.S., respectively. Refer to Note 8 of the consolidated financial statements for further details.

Upholstery fabrics sales decreased 6.4 in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the prior-year period. Upholstery fabrics sales decreased 1.3 in the first half of fiscal 2025 compared to the first half of fiscal 2024. 
 
 The decrease in net sales for our upholstery fabrics segment for both the second quarter and the first half of fiscal 2025 reflects reduced demand for our residential upholstery fabric products as compared to the prior-year periods. This reduced demand was driven primarily by ongoing weakness in the residential home furnishings industry, including increased weakness during the second quarter which resulted in lower order levels as many customers, including a significant customer, adjusted their inventory positions to align with industry softness. Net sales for our hospitality/contract fabrics for both the second quarter and the first half of fiscal 2025 were relatively flat compared to the prior-year periods. 
 
 Looking ahead, we expect the lower customer order levels noted above will pressure residential fabric sales during the third quarter of fiscal 2025 as some customers continue to adjust inventory positions. We also expect the soft industry demand backdrop for residential home furnishings may affect our residential business for some period of time. Despite these challenges, we believe our business is well positioned for the long term with our product-driven strategy and innovative product offerings, including our popular portfolio of LiveSmart performance products, supported by our flexible Asian platform and our long-term supplier relationships. We also believe overall demand remains solid for our hospitality/commercial business. 
 
 Notably, the potential ongoing geopolitical disruptions related to wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, as well as the potential impact of future tariffs, remain unknown and depend on factors beyond our control. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of these items on our upholstery fabrics segment, but we note that if conditions worsen in these situations, including shipping disruptions related to wars in the Middle East, or if new tariffs are imposed on our products, the impact on our operations, and/or on our suppliers, customers, consumers, and the global economy, could adversely affect our financial performance.

Income from operations was 615,000 for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to income from operations of 1.4 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Income from operations was 2.3 million for the first half of fiscal 2025, compared to income from operations of 2.7 million for the first half of fiscal 2024. 
 
 The decrease in upholstery fabrics profitability for the second quarter and the first half of fiscal 2025, as compared to the prior-year periods, primarily reflects lower sales; higher inventory markdown expense during the second quarter (as compared with especially low inventory markdown expense during the prior-year period); a less favorable foreign exchange rate associated with this segment's operations in China; and higher freight costs. These factors were offset somewhat by lower SG A expense and lower fixed costs during both periods. 
 
 Based on market dynamics, we took action during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 to restructure our upholstery fabrics finishing operation in China to align with current demand and further leverage our strategic supply relationships. We completed this restructuring initiative during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (see Restructuring Activities Shanghai, China Upholstery Fabrics Finishing Operation below). We believe this move is allowing us to reduce our operating costs while maintaining our ability to support our customers. 
 
 Looking ahead, the residential home furnishings industry remains under pressure due to shifting consumer spending trends, inflation, reduced home sales, and other macroeconomic conditions affecting discretionary consumer spending. As a result, we expect lower sales volumes in our residential business may affect our profitability until market conditions improve. However, for fiscal 2025, we expect to benefit from continued solid demand in our hospitality/commercial fabrics business; improvement in our Read business; and fixed cost savings from our strategic decision to rationalize our upholstery fabric finishing operation in China and further leverage our long-term supply relationships. We will also continue our ongoing cost reduction efforts and will consider further adjustments to rationalize our operations as necessary to align with current demand levels, while maintaining our ability to service our customers.

restructuring activity was completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and resulted in cumulative restructuring and restructuring related charges totaling 218,000. 
 
 Ouanaminthe, Haiti 
 
 Cut and Sew Upholstery Fabrics Operation 
 
 During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, Culp Upholstery Fabrics Haiti, Ltd. ("CUF Haiti") entered into an agreement to terminate a lease associated with one facility, and in turn moved the production of upholstery cut and sewn kits to another existing facility leased by Culp Home Fashions Haiti, Ltd. ("CHF Haiti") during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Both CUF Haiti and CHF Haiti are indirectly wholly owned subsidiaries of the company. During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, demand for upholstery cut and sewn kits declined more than previously anticipated, resulting in the strategic action to discontinue the production of upholstery cut and sewn kits in Haiti. This restructuring activity was completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and resulted in cumulative restructuring and restructuring related charges of 1.3 million.

 Accounts Receivable 
 As of October 27, 2024, accounts receivable increased slightly as compared with October 29, 2023. This trend reflects slower cash collections due to an unfavorable mix of customers with longer payment cycles during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to the prior-year period. As a result, days sales outstanding for this segment increased to 39 days for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared with 36 days for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. However, the increase in accounts receivable from slower cash collections was partially offset by a decrease in net sales of 1.7 million, or 6.4 , during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 As of October 27, 2024, accounts receivable increased by 843,000, or 7.6 , compared with April 28, 2024. This trend reflects an increase in net sales of 1.8 million, or 7.7 , during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 were 25.6 million, an increase of 1.8 million, or 7.7 , compared with net sales of 23.8 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Also, the increase in accounts receivable was attributable to slower cash collections as noted in the preceding paragraph during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. As a result, days sales outstanding for this segment increased to 39 days for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared with 37 days for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 Inventory 
 As of October 27, 2024, inventory decreased by 1.4 million, or 8.1 , compared with October 29, 2023. This decrease in inventory primarily represents the decrease in net sales during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared with the prior-year period, as described in the above section titled "Segment Analysis-Upholstery Fabrics-Net Sales." 
 As of October 27, 2024, inventory decreased by 1.3 million, or 7.5 , compared with April 28, 2024. Although net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 increased by 1.8 million, or 7.7 , compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, this decrease in inventory reflects management's ability to maintain appropriate levels of inventory, taking into account current and expected future demand trends and any changes in our global supply chain. 
 Inventory turns were 5.1 for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared with 4.6 for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and 4.4 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 I- 43 

Property, Plant, Equipment 
 As of October 27, 2024, property, plant, and equipment remained relatively flat compared with October 29, 2023, and April 28, 2024, respectively. This trend is mainly due to a reduced level of capital spending commensurate with current unfavorable macro-economic conditions within the home furnishings industry. 
 The 1.2 million as of October 27, 2024, represents property, plant, and equipment of 1.1 million and 95,000 located in the U.S. and China, respectively. The 1.2 million as of October 29, 2023, represents property, plant, and equipment of 1.0 million and 140,000 located in the U.S. and China, respectively. The 1.1 million as of April 28, 2024, represents property, plant, and equipment of 1.0 million and 120,000 located in the U.S. and China, respectively. 
 Right of Use Assets 
 As of October 27, 2024, right of use assets steadily decreased compared with October 29, 2023, and April 28, 2024. This decrease mostly resulted from rent expense incurred over the terms of the existing respective lease agreements and the termination of our agreement to lease a building associated with our upholstery fabrics finishing operation located in Shanghai, China. 
 The 1.1 million as of October 27, 2024, represents right of use assets of 925,000 and 195,000 located in the U.S. and China, respectively. The 2.0 million as of October 29, 2023, represents right of use assets of 1.2 million and 818,000 located in China and the U.S., respectively. The 2.0 million as of April 28, 2024, represents right of use assets of 1.3 million and 709,000 located in China and the U.S., respectively.

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses ("SG A") 
 
 The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses during the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2025, as compared to the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2024, is primarily due to (i) lower incentive compensation that mostly relates to annual bonuses reflecting unfavorable financial results in relation to pre-established performance targets; (ii) lower employee compensation due to the company's restructuring activities described in the section titled "- Segment Analysis-Mattress Fabrics Segment-Restructuring Activities"; and (iii) lower professional and consulting fees. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 
 Interest expense represents our borrowings totaling 4.1 million under a line of credit agreement associated with our operations located in China. 
 Interest Income 
 The decreases in interest income are due to lower average cash balances during the first two quarters of fiscal 2025, as compared to the first two quarters of fiscal 2024. 
 Other (Expense) Income 
 I- 44 

Management is required to assess certain economic factors to determine the currency of the primary economic environment in which our foreign subsidiaries operate. Based on our assessments, the U.S. dollar was determined to be the functional currency of our operations located in China, Canada, and Vietnam. 
 The change in other expense during the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2025, as compared to other income during the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2024, is due mostly to less favorable foreign currency exchange rates applied against our balance sheet accounts denominated in Chinese Renminbi to determine the corresponding U.S. dollar financial reporting amounts during the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2025, as compared to the prior-year periods. During the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we reported a foreign currency exchange loss associated with our operations located in China totaling 186,000, compared with a foreign currency exchange gain of 228,000 during the second quarter of fiscal 2024. During the first half of fiscal 2025, we reported a foreign currency exchange loss associated with our operations located in China totaling 231,000, compared with a foreign currency exchange gain of 679,000 during the first half of fiscal 2024. 
 The 231,000 foreign currency exchange loss related to our operations in China was mostly non-cash and was partially offset by 221,000 of income tax benefit, which will decrease our income tax payments and withholding tax payments associated with future earnings and profits repatriated from our operations located in China to the company's U.S. parent. The income tax benefit of 221,000 was associated with deductible foreign currency exchange losses based on less favorable foreign currency exchange rates applied against balance sheet accounts denominated in U.S. dollars to determine the corresponding Chinese Renminbi local currency amounts. The foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) related to our U.S. dollar denominated balance sheet accounts associated with our operations located in China are considered taxable income or tax deductible, as we incur income tax expense (benefit) and pay income taxes in China's local currency.

 We recorded income tax expense of 190,000, or (1.5 of loss before income taxes, for the six-month period ending October 27, 2024, compared with income tax expense of 1.2 million, or (26.8 of loss before income taxes, for the six-month period ending October 29, 2023. 
 Our effective income tax rates for the six-month periods ended October 27, 2024, and October 29, 2023, were based upon the estimated effective income tax rate applicable for the full year after giving effect to any significant items related specifically to interim periods. When calculating the annual estimated effective income tax rates for the six-month periods ended October 27, 2024, and October 29, 2023, we were subject to loss limitation rules. These loss limitation rules require any taxable loss associated with our U.S. or foreign operations to be excluded from the annual estimated effective income tax rate calculation if it was determined that no income tax benefit could be recognized during the current fiscal year. The effective income tax rate can be affected over the fiscal year by the mix and timing of actual earnings from our U.S. operations and foreign subsidiaries located in China, Canada, Haiti, and Vietnam versus annual projections, as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar. 
 The following schedule summarizes the principal differences between income tax expense at the U.S. federal income tax rate and the effective income tax rate reflected in the consolidated financial statements for the six-month periods ending October 27, 2024, and October 29, 2023:

Our consolidated effective income tax rates for the first half of fiscal 2025 and the first half of fiscal 2024 were both adversely affected by the mix of earnings between our U.S. operations and foreign subsidiaries, as our taxable income stems mostly from our operations located in China, which has a higher income tax rate than the U.S. In addition, during the first half of fiscal 2025 and the first half of 2024, we incurred pre-tax losses associated with our U.S. operations, for which an income tax benefit was not recorded due to a full valuation allowance applied against our U.S. net deferred income tax assets. The income tax charge associated 
 I- 45 

with the full valuation allowance applied against our U.S. net deferred income tax assets was higher during the first half of fiscal 2025 compared with the first half of fiscal 2024, as our (12.4) million U.S. pre-tax loss incurred during the first half of fiscal 2025 was significantly greater than the (5.8) million U.S. pre-tax loss incurred during the first half of fiscal 2024. 
 
 During the first half of fiscal 2025, we incurred a greater consolidated pre-tax loss totaling (12.7) million, compared with (4.5) million during the first half of fiscal 2024. As a result, the principal differences between income tax expense at the U.S. federal income tax rate and the effective income tax rate reflected in the consolidated financial statements were more pronounced during the first half of fiscal 2024, as compared with the first half of fiscal 2025. 
 
 U.S. Valuation Allowance 
 We evaluate the realizability of our U.S. net deferred income tax assets to determine if a valuation allowance is required. We assess whether a valuation allowance should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more-likely-than-not standard, with significant weight being given to evidence that can be objectively verified. Since the company operates in multiple jurisdictions, we assess the need for a valuation allowance on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, considering the effects of local tax law. 
 As of October 27, 2024, we evaluated the realizability of our U.S. net deferred income tax assets to determine if a full valuation allowance was required. Based on our assessment, we determined we still have a recent history of significant cumulative U.S. pre-tax losses, in that we experienced U.S. pre-tax losses during each of the last three fiscal years from 2022 through 2024, and we are currently expecting significant U.S. pre-tax losses to continue during fiscal 2025. As a result of the significant weight of this negative evidence, we believe it is more likely than not that our U.S. deferred income tax assets will not be fully realizable, and therefore we provided for a full valuation allowance against our U.S. net deferred income tax assets. 
 Based on our assessments as of October 27, 2024, October 29, 2023, and April 28, 2024, valuation allowances against our net deferred income tax assets pertain to the following:

Undistributed Earnings 
 We assess whether the undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries will be reinvested indefinitely or eventually distributed to our U.S. parent company and whether we are required to record a deferred income tax liability for those undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries that will not be reinvested indefinitely. As of October 27, 2024, we assessed the liquidity requirements of our U.S. parent company and determined that our undistributed earnings and profits from our foreign subsidiaries would not be reinvested indefinitely and would eventually be distributed to our U.S. parent company. The conclusion reached from this assessment was consistent with prior reporting periods. 
 As a result of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a U.S. corporation is allowed a 100 dividend received deduction for earnings and profits received from a 10 owned foreign corporation. Therefore, a deferred income tax liability will be required only for unremitted withholding taxes associated with earnings and profits generated by our foreign subsidiaries that will ultimately be repatriated to the U.S. parent company. As a result, as of October 27, 2024, October 29, 2023, and April 28, 2024, we recorded a deferred income tax liability of 5.0 million, 4.6 million, and 4.8 million, respectively. 
 Uncertain Income Tax Positions 
 An unrecognized income tax benefit for an uncertain income tax position can be recognized in the first interim period if the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is met by the end of the reporting period, or is effectively settled through examination, negotiation, or litigation, or the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine and challenge the tax position has expired. If it is determined that any of the above conditions occur regarding our uncertain income tax positions, an adjustment to our unrecognized income tax benefit will be recorded at that time. 
 I- 46 

As of October 27, 2024, October 29, 2023, and April 28, 2024, we had a 1.4 million, 1.2 million, and 1.3 million total of gross unrecognized income tax benefits, of which the entire amount was classified as income taxes payable long-term in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of October 27, 2024, the unrecognized tax benefit would favorably affect income tax expense in future periods by 1.4 million. 
 Our gross unrecognized income tax benefit of 1.4 million as of October 27, 2024, relates to income tax positions for which significant change could occur within the next year if the statute of limitations for relevant taxing authorities to examine and challenge the tax position expires.

Future Liquidity 
 Based on the restructuring plan approved by our board of directors on April 29, 2024, the timing and success of the closure of our Canadian operation, along with the sale of associated real estate (the timing and amount of which sales price is currently undetermined), could have a significant effect on (i) the amount and timing of when and if fiscal 2025 income tax payments will be required; (ii) the amount and timing of withholding tax payments to the Canadian government associated with the repatriation of earnings and profits to the U.S. parent; and (iii) the respective tax rates that will be applied on the sale of equipment. Accordingly, we believe we cannot provide a reasonable estimate of our fiscal 2025 income tax payments associated with our Canadian operation at this time. 
 Currently, we are projecting annual cash income tax payments of approximately 1.7 million associated with our operations located in China. This estimate is management's current projection only and can be affected by actual earnings versus annual projections, changes in the foreign exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar, and the timing of when we will repatriate earnings and profits from China to our U.S. parent. 
 Currently, we do not expect to incur any income taxes in the U.S. on a cash basis during fiscal 2025 due to (i) the accelerated expensing of U.S. capital expenditures and our existing U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards totaling 69.6 million as of April 28, 2024. As of October 27, 2024, we will be required to pay a U.S. federal transition tax payment, in accordance with the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 831,000 by August 15, 2025. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity 
 Overall 
 Currently, our sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents (collectively, "cash"), cash flow from operations, and amounts available under our revolving credit lines. As of October 27, 2024, we believe our cash of 10.5 million and the current availability under our revolving credit lines totaling 22.6 million will be sufficient to fund our foreseeable business needs, restructuring activities, capital expenditures, commitments, and contractual obligations. Refer to Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our revolving credit lines. 
 As of October 27, 2024, our cash totaled 10.5 million, which represents a slight increase compared with cash of 10.0 million as of April 28, 2024. This increase was mostly due to 4.0 million in cash proceeds from borrowings on a line of credit associated with our operations located in China and 527,000 in cash proceeds from the sale of equipment associated with our restructuring activities, mostly offset by 1.6 million in capital expenditures and 2.6 million of net cash used in operating activities. 
 I- 47 

Our net cash used in operating activities was 2.6 million during the first half of fiscal 2025, a decrease of 1.9 million compared with net cash used in operating activities of 4.5 million during the first half of fiscal 2024. This trend mostly reflects (i) an increase in accounts payable due to an increase in inventory purchases from significant vendors who extended their terms during the first half of fiscal 2025 compared with fiscal 2024, partially offset by (ii) an increase in inventory purchases to maintain an appropriate level of inventory during the company's recent restructuring activities, as described above in the section titled Segment Analysis Mattress Fabrics Segment Restructuring Activities, and (iii) an increase in accounts receivable primarily due to an increase in net sales during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 As of October 27, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings totaling 4.1 million under a line of credit agreement associated with our operations located in China. 
 The income taxes we pay also affect our liquidity. See the above section titled Income Taxes Paid for further detail. 
 
 Our cash balance may be adversely affected by factors beyond our control, such as (i) recent customer demand trends affecting net sales, (ii) supply chain disruptions, (iii) higher interest rates and inflation, (iv) world events (including wars in Ukraine and the Middle East), and (v) the continuing uncertainty associated with COVID-19. These factors could cause delays in receipt of payment on accounts receivable and could increase cash disbursements due to rising prices.

Common Stock Repurchase Program 
 In March 2020, our board of directors approved an authorization for us to acquire up to 5.0 million of our common stock. Under the common stock repurchase program, shares may be purchased from time to time in open market transactions, block trades, through plans established under the Securities Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1, or otherwise. The number of shares purchased and the timing of such purchases are based on working capital requirements, market and general business conditions, and other factors, including alternative investment opportunities. 
 We did not repurchase any shares of common stock during the six month periods ending October 27, 2024, or October 29, 2023, respectively. 
 As of October 27, 2024, 3.2 million is available for additional repurchases of our common stock. 
 Dividends 
 On June 29, 2022, our board of directors announced the decision to suspend the company s quarterly cash dividend. We believed that preserving capital and managing our liquidity were in the company s best interest to support future growth and the long-term interests of our shareholders. Accordingly, we did not make any dividend payments during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, fiscal 2024, and fiscal 2023. 
 Working Capital 
 Operating Working Capital 
 Operating working capital (the total of accounts receivable and inventories, less accounts payable-trade, less accounts payable-capital expenditures, and less deferred revenue) was 33.4 million as of October 27, 2024, compared with 38.4 million as of October 29, 2023, and 38.5 million as of April 28, 2024. Operating working capital turnover was 6.0 during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared with 5.5 during the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and 5.8 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 I- 48 

Accounts Receivable 
 Accounts receivable was 22.3 million as of October 27, 2024, a decrease of 706,000, or 3.1 , compared with 23.0 million as of October 29, 2023. This trend was mostly due to a 5.2 decrease in consolidated nets sales during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Days sales outstanding were 35 days for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, and were slightly higher compared with 34 days for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 Accounts receivable as of October 27, 2024, increased 1.2 million, or 5.6 , compared with 21.1 million as of April 28, 2024. This trend was due to a 12.4 increase in net sales during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. However, this increase in accounts receivable was partially offset by faster cash collections stemming from improved payment trends with larger customers associated with our mattress fabrics segment during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. As a result, days sales outstanding decreased to 35 days for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared with 36 days for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 Inventory 
 Inventory was 45.1 million as of October 27, 2024, and was comparable to 44.5 million and 44.8 million as of October 29, 2023, and April 28, 2024, respectively. This trend represents management's ability to maintain an appropriate level of inventory during the company's recent restructuring plan as described above in the section titled Segment Analysis Mattress Fabrics Segment Restructuring Activities, and taking into account current and expected future demand trends and any changes in our global supply chain. 
 Inventory turns were 4.5 for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared with 4.6 for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and 3.9 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 Accounts Payable - Trade 
 As of October 27, 2024, accounts payable - trade was 32.4 million, which represents a significant increase compared with 27.9 million and 25.6 million as of October 29, 2023, and April 28, 2024, respectively. This trend mostly represents an increase in inventory purchases from significant vendors who extended credit terms during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 Financing Arrangements 
 Currently, we have revolving credit agreements with banks for our U.S parent company and our operations located in China. As of October 27, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings totaling 4.1 million under a line of credit agreement associated with our operations located in China. Our loan agreements require, among other things, that we maintain compliance with certain financial covenants. As of October 27, 2024, we were in compliance with these financial covenants. 
 Refer to Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements for further disclosure regarding our revolving credit agreements. 
 Capital Expenditures and Depreciation 
 Overall 
 Capital expenditures on a cash basis during the first half of fiscal 2025 totaled 1.6 million, compared with 2.0 million during the first half of fiscal 2024. This level of capital spending reflects reduced capital spending during the current unfavorable macro-economic conditions within the home furnishings and bedding industries. 
 Depreciation expense was 4.4 million for the first half of fiscal 2025, compared with 3.3 million for the same period a year ago, and was mostly related to our mattress fabrics segment for both periods. In addition, for the first half of fiscal 2025, depreciation expense for the mattress fabrics segment included 1.3 million of additional depreciation expense related to the shortening of useful lives of equipment associated with our manufacturing facility located in Quebec, Canada. This 1.3 million of additional 
 I- 49 

depreciation expense was classified as restructuring expense in the Consolidated Statement of Net Loss for the six-month period ending October 27, 2024. 
 For the remainder of fiscal 2025, our capital spending will be centered on our mattress fabrics segment, with a strategic focus on capital projects that will increase efficiencies and improve the quality of our products. Funding for capital expenditures is expected to be from cash provided by operating activities. 
 Accounts Payable Capital Expenditures 
 As of October 27, 2024, we had amounts due regarding capital expenditures totaling 602,000 that pertained to outstanding vendor invoices, none of which were financed. The total amount outstanding of 602,000 is required to be paid based on normal credit terms. 
 Purchase Commitments Capital Expenditures 
 As of October 27, 2024, we had open purchase commitments to acquire equipment for our mattress fabrics segment totaling 571,000. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Developments 
 As of October 27, 2024, there were no changes in our significant accounting policies or the application of those policies from those reported in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 28, 2024. 
 Refer to Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements, if any, since the filing of our Form 10-K for the year ended April 28, 2024. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 There were no significant or new contractual obligations since those reported in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 28, 2024. 
 Inflation 
 Any significant increase in our raw material costs, utility/energy costs, and general economic inflation could have a material adverse impact on the company, because competitive conditions have limited our ability to pass significant operating cost increases on to customers. 
 During fiscal 2024 and continuing through the second quarter of fiscal 2025, raw material costs started to decline due to slowing global demand; however, the cost of labor remained challenging during fiscal 2024 and continuing through the second quarter of fiscal 2025. 
 Inflationary pressures also affected consumer spending during fiscal 2024 and continuing through the second quarter of fiscal 2025, causing a slowdown in business in both the mattress industry and the residential home furnishings industry. This slowdown has caused reduced demand from producers of home furnishings for our mattress fabrics and residential upholstery fabrics products during fiscal 2024 and in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. 
 We are unable to predict how long these trends will last, or to what extent inflationary pressures may affect the economic and purchasing cycle for home furnishing products (and therefore affect demand for our products) over the short and long term. 
 
 I- 50 

ITEM 3. 	 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Interest Rates 
 We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our revolving credit agreements. 
 Effective January 19, 2023, we entered into a second amended and restated U.S. revolving credit agreement (the "Amended Agreement") to establish an asset-based revolving credit facility that required interest to be charged at a rate calculated using an applicable margin over Federal Reserve Bank of New York's secured overnight fund rate (SOFR), as defined in the Amended Agreement. The interest rate under the Amended Agreement as of October 27, 2024, was 6.33 . As of October 27, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Amended Agreement. 
 
 Effective March 20, 2024, we entered into an unsecured credit agreement with a financial institution in China denominated in RMB that requires interest to be charged at a rate based on the Loan Prime Rate ("LPR") in China minus 50 basis points (2.60 as of October 27, 2024). There were outstanding borrowings under this agreement totaling 4.1 million as of October 27, 2024. 
 On November 5, 2024, we entered into an unsecured credit agreement with another financial institution in China denominated in RMB that requires interest to be charged at a rate based on the Loan Prime Rate ("LPR") in China minus 50 basis points (2.60 as of October 27, 2024). There were no outstanding borrowings under this agreement as of October 27, 2024. 
 Foreign Currency 
 We are exposed to market risk from changes in the value of foreign currencies for our subsidiaries domiciled in Canada, China, and Vietnam. We try to maintain a natural hedge by keeping a balance of our assets and liabilities denominated in the local currency of our subsidiaries domiciled in Canada, China, and Vietnam. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to continually maintain this natural hedge. Our foreign subsidiaries use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. A substantial portion of the company s imports purchased outside the U.S. are denominated in U.S. dollars. A 10 change in the above exchange rates as of October 27, 2024, would not have materially affected our results of operations or financial position. 
 ITEM 4. 	 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 As of October 27, 2024, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). This evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date, in all material respects, to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed by us and submitted under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported as and when required, and that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed by us under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, in a manner to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure. 
 During the quarter ended October 27, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

(ii) Recipient terminates his/her employment for Good Reason within one year following the initial existence of the conditions giving rise to such Good Reason;

The parties intend for the immediately preceding sentence to be interpreted and applied so as to prevent Recipient from receiving, with respect to a Change of Control, an excess parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. 

Section 6. Clawback . 

(a) If the Corporation s reported financial or operating results become subject to a material negative restatement, the Committee, in its discretion, may require Recipient to pay to the Corporation an amount corresponding to the amount that the Committee determines would not have been vested or paid if the Corporation s results as originally published had been equal to the Corporation s results as subsequently restated; provided that any requirement or claim under this Section 6(a) must be made, if at all, within five years after the date the amount claimed was originally vested or paid, whichever is later. 

In addition, pursuant to the Corporation s Dodd-Frank Clawback Policy (as amended from time to time, the Clawback Policy ), if the Committee determines that recoupment of compensation paid hereunder is required pursuant to the Clawback Policy, the Committee will require Recipient to repay or return compensation awarded hereunder. By acceptance of any Award or bonus payment hereunder, Recipient expressly acknowledges and agrees that any and all amounts paid to Recipient hereunder, and any other Incentive-Based Compensation paid by the Corporation to the Recipient, are and will be fully subject to the terms of the Clawback Policy (provided that Recipient is, or becomes, an individual that is subject to the Clawback Policy) and agrees to cooperate fully with the Corporation to facilitate the recovery of any and all amounts paid pursuant to this Agreement and any other Incentive-Based Compensation paid by the Corporation that the Committee determines in its sole discretion is required to be recovered pursuant to the terms of the Clawback Policy. 
 The obligations of Recipient to make payments or return bonus amounts paid hereunder pursuant to this Section 6(a) are independent of any involvement by such Recipient in events that led to the restatement. The provisions of this Section 6(a) are in addition to, not in lieu of, any remedies that the Corporation may have against any persons whose misconduct caused or contributed to a need to restate the Corporation s reported results. 
 (b) If at any time within three years of the vesting or payment of any award to Recipient under this Agreement, whichever is later, Recipient s employment is terminated for Cause (or, if such termination is deemed not to be for Cause, but the Corporation determines at any time during such three-year period that the Corporation could have terminated Recipient s employment for Cause based on Recipient s conduct during his or her time of employment with the Corporation), then if any part of the underlying conduct or circumstances giving rise to such determination of Cause by the Corporation took place at any time during the applicable vesting period for each such award, as specified in this 

5 

Agreement, then the Committee may require Recipient to pay to the Corporation an amount corresponding to each award that vested or was paid to Recipient pursuant to this Agreement. 

By acceptance of any Award or bonus payment hereunder, Recipient expressly acknowledges and agrees that any and all amounts paid to Recipient hereunder are and will be fully subject to the terms of the foregoing clawback provisions, and agrees to cooperate fully with the Corporation to facilitate the recovery of any such amounts that the Committee requires to be recovered pursuant to the foregoing.

(d) No Right to Employment . Nothing in this Agreement shall confer on Recipient any right to continue in the employ of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries. 

(e) Counterparts . This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

Section 7. Clawback . 

(a) If the Corporation s reported financial or operating results become subject to a material negative restatement, the Committee may require Recipient to pay to the Corporation an amount corresponding to each award to the Recipient under this Agreement, or otherwise return such Units or Common Stock, that the Committee determines would not have been vested or paid if the Corporation s results as originally published had been equal to the Corporation s results as subsequently restated; provided that any requirement or claim under this Section 7(a) must be made, if at all, within five years after the date the amount claimed was originally vested or paid, whichever is later. 

In addition, pursuant to the Corporation s Dodd-Frank Clawback Policy (as amended from time to time, the Clawback Policy ), if the Committee determines that recoupment of compensation paid hereunder is required pursuant to the Clawback Policy, the Committee will require Recipient to repay or return compensation awarded hereunder. By acceptance of any Award or bonus payment hereunder, Recipient expressly acknowledges and agrees that any and all amounts paid to Recipient hereunder, and any other Incentive-Based Compensation paid by the Corporation to the Recipient, are and will be fully subject to the terms of the Clawback Policy (provided that Recipient is, or becomes, an individual that is subject to the Clawback Policy) and agrees to cooperate fully with the Corporation to facilitate the recovery of any and all amounts paid pursuant to this Agreement and any other Incentive-Based Compensation paid by the Corporation that the Committee determines in its sole discretion is required to be recovered pursuant to the terms of the Clawback Policy. 
 The obligations of Recipient to make payments or return Common Stock pursuant to this Section 7(a) are independent of any involvement by such Recipient in events that led to the restatement. The provisions of this Section (a) are in addition to, not in lieu of, any remedies that the Corporation may have against any persons whose misconduct caused or contributed to a need to restate the Corporation s reported results. 
 (b) If at any time within three years of the vesting or payment of any award to Recipient under this Agreement, whichever is later, Recipient s employment is terminated for Cause (or, if such termination is deemed not to be for Cause, but the Corporation determines at any time during such three-year period that the Corporation could have 

6 

terminated Recipient s employment for Cause based on Recipient s conduct during his or her time of employment with the Corporation), then if any part of the underlying conduct giving rise to such determination of Cause by the Corporation took place at any time during the applicable vesting period for each such award, as specified in this Agreement, then the Committee may require Recipient to pay to the Corporation an amount corresponding to each award that vested or was paid to Recipient pursuant to this Agreement, or to otherwise return such Units or Common Stock. 

(c) By acceptance of any award or Units hereunder, Recipient expressly acknowledges and agrees that any and all Units or Common Stock, as well as the Award-Equivalent Value thereof, are and will be fully subject to the terms of the foregoing clawback provisions, and agrees to cooperate fully with the Corporation to facilitate the recovery of any Units or Common Stock and/or Award-Equivalent Value that the Committee requires to be recovered pursuant to the foregoing.
