These statements, which may be identified by the use of forward-looking words or phrases, include statements relating to: our business strategies and plans; products, gaming and entertainment; anticipated cost savings; expected debt repayments; expected impact of newly issued accounting pronouncements; and financial targets. Our actual actions or results may differ materially from those expected or anticipated in the forward-looking statements due to both known and unknown risks and uncertainties. 
 Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: 
 
 our ability to successfully execute on our business strategy and transformation initiatives, and to achieve anticipated cost savings; 
 our ability to successfully innovate and invest in digital gaming, licensing arrangements and partnerships; 
 our ability to successfully compete in the play industry; 
 our ability to transform our business and capabilities to address the changing global consumer landscape, including evolving demographics for our products and advancements in technology; 
 our ability to design, develop, manufacture, and ship products on a timely and profitable basis; 
 the concentration of our customers, potentially increasing the negative impact to our business of difficulties experienced by any of our customers or changes in their purchasing or selling patterns; 
 inflation and downturns in global and regional economic conditions impacting one or more of the markets in which we sell products, which can negatively impact our customers and consumers, result in lower employment levels, consumer disposable income, retailer inventories and spending, including lower spending on purchases of our products; 
 risks related to political, economic and public health conditions or regulatory changes in the markets in which we and our customers, partners, licensees, suppliers and manufacturers operate, such as inflation, rising interest rates, tariffs, higher commodity prices, labor costs or transportation costs, or outbreaks of illness or disease, the occurrence of which could create work slowdowns, delays or shortages in production or shipment of products, increases in costs or delays in revenue; 
 our dependence on third party relationships, including with third party partners, manufacturers, distributors, studios, content producers, licensors, licensees, and outsourcers, which creates reliance on others and loss of control; 
 risks relating to the concentration of manufacturing for many of our products in the People s Republic of China and our ability to successfully diversify sourcing of our products to reduce reliance on sources of supply in China; 
 risks associated with international operations, such as conflict in territories in which we operate, currency conversion, currency fluctuations, the imposition of tariffs, quotas, shipping delays or difficulties, border adjustment taxes or other protectionist measures, and other challenges in the territories in which we operate; 
 the success of our key partner brands, including the ability to secure, maintain and extend agreements with our key partners or the risk of delays, increased costs or difficulties associated with any of our or our partners planned digital applications or media initiatives; 
 risks related to our leadership changes; 
 our ability to attract and retain talented and diverse employees, particularly following recent workforce reductions; 
 risks relating to the impairment and/or write-offs of businesses, products and content we acquire and/or produce; 
 the risk that acquisitions, dispositions and other investments we complete may not provide us with the benefits we expect, or the realization of such benefits may be significantly delayed; 
 our ability to protect our assets and intellectual property, including as a result of infringement, theft, misappropriation, cyber-attacks or other acts compromising the integrity of our assets or intellectual property; 
 3 

fluctuations in our business due to seasonality; 
 the risk of product recalls or product liability suits and costs associated with product safety regulations; 
 changes in accounting or tax laws or regulations, or the interpretation and application of such laws and regulations, which may cause us to alter reserves or make other changes which significantly impact our reported financial results; 
 the impact of litigation or arbitration decisions or settlement actions; 
 the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one or more of our significant retailers, licensees and other partners; and 
 other risks and uncertainties as may be detailed in our public announcements and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC filings. 
 For a detailed discussion of these and other risks, uncertainties and factors, see Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Annual Report ). 
 
 The statements contained herein are based on our current beliefs and expectations. We undertake no obligation to make any revisions to the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q or to update them to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this Form 10-Q.

 Notes that were repaid in full in the aggregate principal amount of million in 2021, and the Notes due 2044. At the date of debt issuance, these contracts were terminated and the fair value on the date of settlement was deferred in AOCE and is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the related Notes using the effective interest rate method. At September 29, 2024, deferred losses, net of tax of million related to these instruments remained in AOCE. For each of the three months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, previously deferred losses, net of tax of million related to these instruments were reclassified from AOCE to net earnings. For the nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, previously deferred losses, net of tax of million and million, respectively, related to these instruments were reclassified from AOCE to net earnings. 
 
 Of the net deferred losses included in AOCE at September 29, 2024, the Company expects net losses of approximately million to be reclassified to the Consolidated Statements of Operations within the next twelve months. However, the amount ultimately realized in earnings is dependent on the fair value of the hedging instruments on the settlement dates.

 During 2022 and 2023, Hasbro implemented its Operational Excellence program ("the Program"), an ongoing enterprise-wide initiative intended to improve our business through programs that include targeted cost-savings, supply chain transformation and certain other restructuring actions designed to drive growth and enhance shareholder value. The Company's organizational structure changes have resulted and will further result in workforce reductions as well as the reallocation of people and resources, which will include voluntary early retirement for certain groups of employees and additional involuntary reduction in employees ("Additional Actions"). The Company currently anticipates that the Additional Actions will be substantially complete over the next to months.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 (Dollar and share amounts in tables presented in millions, unless otherwise noted) 
 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read together with the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report and the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in the 2023 Annual Report. 

Overview 
 
 Hasbro, Inc. ("Hasbro") is a game, toy, and intellectual property company whose mission is to entertain and connect generations of fans through the exhilaration of play and the wonder of storytelling. We are Creating Magic Through Play by delivering engaging brand experiences for global audiences across gaming, consumer products and entertainment, with a portfolio of iconic brands including MAGIC: THE GATHERING, Hasbro Gaming, PLAY-DOH, NERF, TRANSFORMERS, DUNGEONS DRAGONS, and PEPPA PIG, as well as premier partner brands. 
 
 Hasbro is guided by our purpose to create joy and community for all people around the world, one game, one toy, one story at a time. For the past decade, we have been consistently recognized for our corporate citizenship, including being named one of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens by 3BL Media. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 In fiscal year 2023, we embarked upon an ambitious, multi-year transformation guided by our revamped strategy to focus on fewer, bigger and better brands. Since that announcement, we have been able to create efficiencies in our supply chain, improve our inventory position, lower our costs, and reinvest back into the business. In addition, we have strengthened our leadership team with industry veterans and turnaround experts and have focused our strategic investments on our most valuable and profitable franchises across games, toys, licensing and entertainment. This focused strategy also led to the decision to sell certain non-core parts of our business, including the Entertainment One film and television business ("eOne Film and TV") in December 2023, while retaining brand-based created content and the capability to develop and produce entertainment including animation, digital shorts, scripted TV and theatrical films related to core Hasbro IP, as well as our Family Brands business. In addition, during 2023, we made the difficult decision to take additional headcount reductions and accelerate the process of certain organizational structure changes in an effort to strengthen our foundation and position Hasbro for growth. 
 
 Summary of Quarter and Year to Date Results 
 During 2024, the Company experienced declines in revenue from 1,503.4 million and 3,714.4 million for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2023, respectively, to 1,281.3 million and 3,033.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively. The decline in revenue for the three months ended September 29, 2024 from three months ended October 1, 2023 is driven primarily by the sale of eOne Film and TV business and by broader industry trends, exited businesses, shifts in product mix, a lighter entertainment slate in the current year, reduced closeout sales in the Consumer Products business, and the decrease in our Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming revenues, mainly from the higher digital licensing of Baldur's Gate 3 that was launched within the three months ended October 1, 2023 with no comparable releases in 2024. The decline in revenue for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 from nine months ended October 1, 2023is driven primarily by the sale of eOne Film and TV business and by broader industry trends, exited businesses, shifts in product mix, a lighter entertainment slate in the current year, and reduced closeout sales in the Consumer Products business, partially offset by increases in our Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming revenues driven by higher digital licensing revenue primarily due to MONOPOLY GO! as well as contributions from MAGIC: THE GATHERING. The Company has made strong progress towards its ongoing turnaround efforts while achieving an operating profit of 301.9 million and 630.2 million during the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively, as compared to an operating loss of 169.5 million and 340.2 million for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2023, respectively. See the below discussion for the consolidated and segment results of operations.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following table presents the consolidated results of operations for the three months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Amount of Net Revenues Amount of Net Revenues Net revenues 1,281.3 100.0 1,503.4 100.0 Costs and expenses: Cost of sales 378.9 29.6 494.5 32.9 Program production cost amortization 7.9 0.6 68.4 4.5 Royalties 98.0 7.6 106.9 7.1 Product development 76.3 6.0 76.7 5.1 Advertising 101.9 8.0 81.9 5.4 Amortization of intangibles 17.1 1.3 19.2 1.3 Loss on disposal of business 473.0 31.5 Selling, distribution and administration 299.3 23.4 352.3 23.4 Total costs and expenses 979.4 76.4 1,672.9 111.3 Operating profit (loss) 301.9 23.6 (169.5) (11.3) Non-operating (income) expense: Interest expense 46.2 3.6 47.1 3.1 Interest income (14.7) (1.1) (3.8) (0.3) Other income, net (19.9) (1.6) 2.2 0.1 Total non-operating expense, net 11.6 0.9 45.5 3.0 Earnings (loss) before income taxes 290.3 22.7 (215.0) (14.3) Income tax expense (benefit) 67.0 5.2 (44.6) (3.0) Net earnings (loss) 223.3 17.4 (170.4) (11.3) Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 0.1 0.7 Net earnings (loss) attributable to Hasbro, Inc. 223.2 17.4 (171.1) (11.4) Net earnings (loss) per common share: Basic 1.60 (1.23) Diluted 1.59 (1.23) 
 
 Net revenues - Net revenues for the third quarter of 2024 declined 15 to 1,281.3 million from 1,503.4 million for the third quarter of 2023 primarily driven by a 105.7 million, or 86 , decline in the Entertainment driven by the sale of the eOne Film and TV business, a 96.8 million, or 10 , decline in the Consumer Products segment, and a 19.6 million, or 5 , decrease in the Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment. See the Segment Results discussion below for further details. 
 
 The following table presents net revenues by brand portfolio category for the three months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Change Franchise Brands 941.6 1,011.0 (7) Partner Brands 190.1 228.2 (17) Portfolio Brands 149.6 170.6 (12) Non-Hasbro Branded Film TV (1) 
 93.6 (100) Total 1,281.3 1,503.4 (15) 
 30 

(1) Net revenues from the Company's Non-Hasbro-branded Film and TV portfolio were associated with the Company's non-core eOne Film and TV business sold to Lionsgate during the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 
 FRANCHISE BRANDS: Net revenues in the Franchise Brands portfolio decreased 69.4 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023. The net revenue decrease primarily reflects lower net revenues from NERF and DUNGEONS DRAGONS products, partially offset by higher net revenues from MONOPOLY GO! , along with MAGIC: THE GATHERING products. 
 
 PARTNER BRANDS: Net revenues from the Partner Brands portfolio decreased 38.1 million, or 17 , in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023. Within the Partner Brands portfolio, there are a number of brands which are reliant on related entertainment, including television and movie releases. As such, net revenues from Partner Brands fluctuate depending on entertainment popularity, release dates and related product line offerings. Historically these entertainment-based brands experience higher revenues during years in which new content is released in theaters, for broadcast, and on streaming platforms. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, Partner Brands net revenue decreases were driven by lower net revenues from the Company's products for STAR WARS and MARVEL which benefited from a broader slate of entertainment releases in prior years without a more recent entertainment release to support revenue in the third quarter of 2024. This was partially offset by higher net revenues from BEY BLADE following the Company's reintroduction of the brand. Additionally, revenue in the third quarter of 2023 was higher due to the Company's products for INDIANA JONES supported by the June 2023 theatrical release of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny . 
 
 PORTFOLIO BRANDS: Portfolio Brands net revenues decreased 21.0 million, or 12 , in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. Lower net revenues from POWER RANGERS, BABY ALIVE, GI JOE and PJ MASKS products were partially offset by revenue contributions from MY LITTLE PONY trading card products. 
 
 NON-HASBRO BRANDED FILM TV : Net revenues from Non-Hasbro Branded Film TV decreased 93.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. Net revenues from the Company's Non-Hasbro-branded Film and TV portfolio were associated with the eOne Film and TV business sold during the fourth quarter of 2023. Effective in the first quarter of 2024, the Company moved the remaining Non-Hasbro Branded Film TV brands into Portfolio Brands to align with the Company's Brand Strategy. For comparability, net revenues for three months ended October 1, 2023, has been reclassified to reflect the movement, resulting in a change of 0.3 million. 
 
 OPERATING COSTS AND EXPENSES 
 
 Cost of sales - Cost of sales for the third quarter of 2024 was 378.9 million, or 29.6 of net revenues, compared to 494.5 million, or 32.9 of net revenues, for the third quarter of 2023. The Cost of sales decrease in dollars and as a percent of net revenues was driven primarily by lower sales volumes, supply chain productivity, and cost savings initiatives. 
 
 Program cost amortization - Program cost amortization decreased to 7.9 million, or 0.6 of net revenues, for the third quarter of 2024 from 68.4 million, or 4.5 of net revenues, for the third quarter of 2023. Program costs are capitalized as incurred and amortized primarily using the individual-film-forecast method which matches costs to the related recognized revenue. The decrease in dollars and as a percent of net revenues during the third quarter of 2024 was driven by the impact of the sale of the eOne Film and TV business during the fourth quarter of 2023 as prior year Program costs were primarily associated with the eOne Film and TV business. 
 
 Royalties - Royalty expense for the third quarter of 2024 decreased to 98.0 million, or 7.6 of net revenues, compared to 106.9 million, or 7.1 of net revenues, for the third quarter of 2023. Fluctuations in Royalty expense are generally related to the volume of content releases and deliveries and entertainment-driven products sold. The decrease in Royalty expense during the third quarter of 2024 directly reflects the impact of the sale of the eOne Film and TV business. 
 
 Product development - Product development expense for the third quarter of 2024 was 76.3 million, or 6.0 of net revenues, compared to 76.7 million, or 5.1 of net revenues, for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in Product development expense during the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to the Company's cost savings initiatives, along with phasing of product releases. 
 
 Advertising - Advertising expense for the third quarter of 2024 was 101.9 million, or 8.0 of net revenues, compared to 81.9 million, or 5.4 of net revenues, for the third quarter of 2023. The Advertising expense increase during the third quarter of 2024 was primarily driven by the sale initiatives in Consumer Products segment. 
 31 

Amortization of intangibles - Amortization of intangible assets decreased to 17.1 million, or 1.3 of net revenues, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 19.2 million, or 1.3 of net revenues, for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in 2024 reflects lower definite lived intangible assets due to the sale of the eOne Film and TV business and impairments taken in 2023. See further detail of impairments taken in 2023 in Note 6 of the 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Selling, distribution and administration - Selling, distribution and administration expenses decreased to 299.3 million, or 23.4 of net revenues for the third quarter of 2024, from 352.3 million, or 23.4 of net revenues, for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in Selling, distribution and administration expenses during the third quarter of 2024 primarily reflects lower administrative expenses due to cost savings initiatives. 
 
 Operating Profit (Loss) - The operating profit for the third quarter of 2024 was 301.9 million, or 23.6 of net revenues, compared to an operating loss of 169.5 million, or 11.3 of net revenues, for the third quarter of 2023 driven by the factors discussed above. 
 
 NON-OPERATING EXPENSE (INCOME) 
 
 Interest expense - Interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 46.2 million compared to 47.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in Interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 primarily reflects lower average outstanding borrowings in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to third quarter of 2023 due to the assumption of the production financing borrowings by Lionsgate as part of the eOne Film and TV business and due to the retirement of the Company's variable-rate Five-Year term loan using proceeds from the sale of the eOne Film and TV business, both occurring during the fourth quarter of 2023, partially offset by the issuance of the 2034 Notes (see Liquidity and Capital Resources discussion below for further information including description of the 2034 Notes). 
 
 Interest income - Interest income was 14.7 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 3.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. Higher Interest income in 2024 primarily reflects higher average interest rates in 2024 compared to 2023, along with the Company's investment in short-term treasury bills in connection with the issuance of the 2034 Notes (see Liquidity and Capital Resources discussion below for further information including description of the 2034 Notes). 
 
 Other income, net - Other income, net was 19.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to Other income, net of 2.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. The change in Other income, net during 2024 was driven primarily by an increase in foreign currency exchange gains the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 INCOME TAXES 
 
 Income tax expense totaled 67.0 million on pre-tax income of 290.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to income tax benefit of 44.6 million on pre-tax loss of 215.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. Both periods were impacted by discrete tax events including the accrual of potential interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded net discrete tax expense of 1.1 million compared to a net discrete tax benefit of 104.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 The net unfavorable discrete tax expense for the third quarter of 2024 are primarily associated with interest accruals on uncertain tax positions. The net favorable discrete tax benefit for the third quarter of 2023 is primarily associated with a tax benefit on the loss on assets held for sale of 473.0 million, offset by stock compensation and activity related to uncertain tax benefits, primarily interest accruals. Absent discrete items, the tax rates for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 were 22.7 and 23.2 , respectively. The decrease in the base rate of 22.7 for the third quarter of 2024, relative to the third quarter of 2023, is primarily due to the mix of jurisdictions where the Company earned its profits combined with the timing of income recognition during 2023.

 Three Months Ended September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Change Net revenues: Consumer Products 860.1 956.9 (10) Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming 404.0 423.6 (5) Entertainment 17.2 122.9 (86) Total net revenues 1,281.3 1,503.4 (15) Operating profit (loss): Consumer Products 121.0 96.1 26 Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming 181.2 203.4 (11) Entertainment 9.8 (468.5) (102) Corporate and Other (10.1) (0.5) 1,920 Total Operating profit (loss) 301.9 (169.5) (278) 
 
 Consumer Products Segment 
 The following table presents the Consumer Products segment net revenues by major geographic region for the three months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Change North America 526.8 573.6 (8) Europe 162.3 208.7 (22) Asia Pacific 81.9 61.8 33 Latin America 89.1 112.8 (21) Net revenues 860.1 956.9 (10) 
 
 The Consumer Products segment net revenues decreased 10 to 860.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 956.9 million for the third quarter of 2023 primarily driven by broader industry trends, exited businesses, including out-licensing certain brands, shifts in product mix, and reduced closeout sales as a result of last year's inventory clean up initiatives. 
 
 The net revenue decrease primarily reflects lower net revenues from NERF, MARVEL and STAR WARS products. STAR WARS and MARVEL products benefited from a slate of entertainment releases in prior years without a more recent release entertainment release to support revenue in the third quarter of 2024. These declines in revenue were partially offset by revenue growth from BEY BLADE and TRANSFORMERS products and licensing revenue from MY LITTLE PONY. 
 
 Consumer Products segment operating profit for the third quarter of 2024 was 121.0 million or 14.1 of segment net revenues, compared to a segment operating profit of 96.1 million or 10.0 of segment net revenues, for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in operating profit in the third quarter of 2024 was driven by favorable product mix, and savings realized from the Company's cost savings initiatives, lower royalty expenses reflecting the mix of products sold, and lower freight costs, associated with the lower sales volumes.

Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming Segment 
 The following table presents Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment net revenues by category for the three months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Change Tabletop Gaming 296.8 290.5 2 Digital and Licensed Gaming 107.2 133.1 (19) Net revenues 404.0 423.6 (5)

The net revenue decrease in the Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment during the third quarter of 2024 was primarily attributable to revenue contributions from higher digital licensing of Baldur's Gate 3 , the DUNGEONS DRAGONS-based role-playing video game released during the third quarter 2023 with no comparable release during the third quarter 2024. The net revenue decrease from Baldur's Gate 3 was partially offset by net revenue increase from MONOPOLY GO! and Tabletop Gaming revenue which increased 2.2 behind growth in MAGIC: THE GATHERING primarily due to strong demand for Bloomburrow , Duskmourn , and Festival in a Box. 
 
 Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment operating profit was 181.2 million, or 44.9 of segment net revenues for the third quarter of 2024, compared to operating profit of 203.4 million, or 48.0 of segment net revenues, for the third quarter of 2023.

 Entertainment segment net revenues decreased 86 to 17.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 122.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. The net revenue decrease in the Entertainment segment during the third quarter of 2024 was driven by lower net revenues as a result of the sale of the eOne Film and TV business during the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 
 Entertainment segment operating profit was 9.8 million, or 57.0 of segment net revenues for the third quarter of 2024, compared to an operating loss of 468.5 million, or 381 of segment net revenues for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in Entertainment segment operating results during the third quarter of 2024 was driven by recording of a loss on assets held for sale of 473.0 million in the third quarter that related to the sale of the eOne Film and TV business. 
 
 Corporate and Other 
 Corporate and Other operating loss was 10.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to an operating loss of 0.5 million for the third quarter of 2023.

 Net revenues - Net revenues for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 18 to 3,033.9 million from 3,714.4 million for the first nine months of 2023 primarily driven by a 423.5 million, or 87 , decline in the Entertainment segment and a 334.9 million, or 16 , decline in the Consumer Products segment, partially offset by a 77.9 million, or 7 , increase in the Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment.

 The following table presents net revenues by brand portfolio category for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023: 
 Nine Months Ended September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Change Franchise Brands 2,334.7 2,412.8 (3) Partner Brands 402.4 533.8 (25) Portfolio Brands 296.8 370.6 (20) Non-Hasbro Branded Film TV (1) 
 397.2 (100) Total 3,033.9 3,714.4 (18) 
 35 

(1) Net revenues from the Company's Non-Hasbro-branded Film and TV portfolio were associated with the Company's non-core eOne Film and TV business sold to Lionsgate during the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 
 FRANCHISE BRANDS: Net revenues in the Franchise Brands portfolio decreased 78.1 million, or 3 , in the first nine months of 2024, compared to the first nine months of 2023. The net revenue decrease primarily reflects lower net revenues from NERF and TRANSFORMERS products. Net revenues from TRANSFORMERS products in the first nine months of 2023 were supported by the June 2023 theatrical release of TRANSFORMERS: Rise of the Beasts. The lower net revenues from NERF and TRANSFORMERS products were partially offset by higher net revenues from MONOPOLY GO! , along with MAGIC: THE GATHERING products. 
 
 PARTNER BRANDS: Net revenues from the Partner Brands portfolio decreased 131.4 million, or 25 , in the first nine months of 2024, compared to the first nine months of 2023. During the first nine months of 2024, Partner Brands net revenue decreases were driven by lower net revenues from the Company's products for STAR WARS and MARVEL which benefited from a broader slate of entertainment releases in prior years without a more recent release entertainment release to support revenue in the first nine months of 2024. Additionally, revenue in the first nine months of 2023 was higher due to the Company's products for INDIANA JONES supported by the June 2023 theatrical release of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny . 
 
 PORTFOLIO BRANDS: Portfolio Brands net revenues decreased 73.8 million, or 20 , in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023. Lower net revenues from POWER RANGERS, BABY ALIVE, and PJ MASKS products were partially offset by revenue contributions from FURBY products following the Company's reintroduction of the brand and refreshed product line during the second quarter of 2023 and licensing revenue for MY LITTLE PONY trading cards. 
 
 NON-HASBRO BRANDED FILM TV : Net revenues from Non-Hasbro Branded Film TV decreased 397.2 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023. Net revenues from the Company's Non-Hasbro-branded Film and TV portfolio were associated with the eOne Film and TV business sold during the fourth quarter of 2023. Effective in the first quarter of 2024, the Company moved the remaining Non-Hasbro Branded Film TV brands into Portfolio Brands to align with the Company's Brand Strategy. For comparability, net revenues for nine months ended October 1, 2023, has been reclassified to reflect the movement, resulting in a change of 1.2 million. 
 
 OPERATING COSTS AND EXPENSES 
 
 Cost of sales - Cost of sales for the first nine months of 2024 was 820.8 million, or 27.1 of net revenues, compared to 1,132.0 million, or 30.5 of net revenues, for the first nine months of 2023. The Cost of sales decrease in dollars and as a percent of net revenues was driven primarily by lower sales volumes, supply chain productivity, and cost savings initiatives, and a non-recurring 26.7 million benefit related to a historical over-accrual of vendor commitment liabilities as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Program cost amortization - Program cost amortization decreased to 24.5 million, or 0.8 of net revenues, for the first nine months of 2024 from 325.3 million, or 8.8 of net revenues, for the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in dollars and as a percent of net revenues during the first nine months of 2024 was driven by the impact of the sale of the eOne Film and TV business during the fourth quarter of 2023 as prior year Program costs were primarily associated with the eOne Film and TV business. 
 
 Royalties - Royalty expense for the first nine months of 2024 decreased to 204.2 million, or 6.7 of net revenues, compared to 295.8 million, or 8.0 of net revenues, for the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in Royalty expense in dollars and as a percent of net revenues during the first nine months of 2024 directly reflects the impact of the sale of the eOne Film and TV business. 
 
 Product development - Product development expense for the first nine months of 2024 was 212.2 million, or 7.0 of net revenues, compared to 232.4 million, or 6.3 of net revenues, for the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in Product development expense during the first nine months of 2024 was driven by cost savings initiatives from cost savings initiatives, along with phasing of product releases. 
 
 Advertising - Advertising expense for the first nine months of 2024 was 213.8 million, or 7.0 of net revenues, compared to 249.8 million, or 6.7 of net revenues, for the first nine months of 2023. The Advertising expense decrease during the first nine months of 2024 was primarily driven by the sale of the eOne Film and TV business, along with declines in the advertising expense in the Consumer Products segment due to lower net revenues. 
 
 36 

Amortization of intangibles - Amortization of intangible assets decreased to 51.2 million, or 1.7 of net revenues, for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 65.1 million, or 1.8 of net revenues, for the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in 2024 reflects lower definite lived intangible assets due to the sale of the eOne Film and TV business and impairments taken in 2023. See further detail of impairments taken in 2023 in Note 6 of the 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Impairment of goodwill - There were no goodwill impairment charges during the first nine months of 2024. During the first nine months of 2023, the Company recorded 231.2 million of goodwill impairment charges associated with goodwill assigned to the Company's Film and TV reporting unit. See further details in the 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Selling, distribution and administration - Selling, distribution and administration expenses decreased to 852.6 million, or 28.1 of net revenues for the first nine months of 2024, from 1,050.0 million, or 28.3 of net revenues, for the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in Selling, distribution and administration expenses in dollars and as a percent of net revenues during the first nine months of 2024 primarily reflects lower administrative expenses due to cost savings from cost savings initiatives, a prior year intangible asset impairment charge of 65.0 million related to the Company's eOne trademark intangible asset, along with a non-recurring stock-compensation adjustment of 18.1 million recorded during the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by a non-recurring 31.1 million expense related to historical environmental exposures as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Operating Profit (Loss) - The operating profit for the first nine months of 2024 was 630.2 million, or 20.8 of net revenues, compared to an operating loss of (340.2) million, or 9.2 of net revenues, for the first nine months of 2023 driven by the factors discussed above. 
 
 NON-OPERATING EXPENSE (INCOME) 
 
 Interest expense - Interest expense for the first nine months of 2024 totaled 127.7 million compared to 140.0 million in the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in Interest expense for the first nine months of 2024 primarily reflects lower average outstanding borrowings in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to first nine months of 2023 due to the assumption of the production financing borrowings by Lionsgate as part of the eOne Film and TV business and due to the retirement of the Company's variable-rate Five-Year term loan using proceeds from the sale of the eOne Film and TV business, both occurring during the fourth quarter of 2023, partially offset by the issuance of the 2034 Notes (see Liquidity and Capital Resources discussion below for further information including description of the 2034 Notes). 
 
 Interest income - Interest income was 36.0 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 15.6 million in the first nine months of 2023. Higher Interest income in 2024 primarily reflects higher average interest rates in 2024 compared to 2023, along with the Company's investment in short-term treasury bills in connection with the issuance of the 2034 Notes (see Liquidity and Capital Resources discussion below for further information including description of the 2034 Notes). 
 
 Other income, net - Other income, net was 15.7 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to Other income, net of 0.7 million in the first nine months of 2023. The change in Other income, net during 2024 was driven primarily by an increase in foreign currency exchange gains the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 INCOME TAXES 
 
 Income tax expense totaled 133.3 million on pre-tax income of 554.2 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to an income tax benefit of 36.9 million on pre-tax loss of 463.9 million in the first nine months of 2023. Both periods were impacted by discrete tax events including the accrual of potential interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. During the first nine months of 2024, the Company incurred a 24.4 million unfavorable adjustment to the 2023 Loss on Sale of the Film TV reporting unit with no corresponding tax benefit. The first nine months of 2023 includes an impairment of goodwill related to the Film TV reporting unit of 231.2 million with no tax benefit. During the first nine months of 2024, exclusive of the Loss on Sale adjustment, the Company recorded net discrete tax expense of 1.8 million compared to a net benefit, exclusive of the goodwill impairment, of 113.3 million in the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 The unfavorable net discrete tax expense for the first nine months of 2024 is primarily associated with stock-based compensation offset by the release of various uncertain tax positions. The net discrete tax benefits recorded in the first nine months of 2023 is primarily associated with a tax benefit on the impairment of trade names in the Entertainment segment in the second quarter and the loss on assets held for sale of 473.0 million, recorded in the third quarter. Absent discrete items, the tax rates for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 were 22.7 and 25.0 , respectively. The decrease in the base rate of 22.7 for the first nine months of 2024, relative to the first nine months of 2023, is primarily due to the mix of jurisdictions where the Company earned its profits coupled with a pre-tax loss in the first nine months of 2023.

Of the total principal amount of long-term debt, 500.0 million is current as of September 29, 2024 which represents the Company's 3 fixed-rate notes due November 2024 (the "2024 Notes"). See Note 8 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for additional information on long-term debt and long-term debt interest repayment, respectively. 
 
 In May 2024, the Company issued an aggregate of 500.0 million of senior unsecured debt securities that bears a fixed interest of 6.05 due 2034 (the "2034 Notes"). In connection with the issuance of the 2034 Notes, the 2034 Notes were issued with an original issuance discount of 1.4 million and capitalized 5.3 million of debt issuance costs. The original issuance discount and debt issuance costs will be amortized over the term of the 2034 Notes. It is anticipated that proceeds from the 2034 Notes, along with existing cash available, will be utilized to repay the 2024 Notes. As of September 29, 2024, the Company had invested the proceeds from the 2034 Notes in short-term investments. 
 
 From time to time, the Company or its affiliates may seek to retire or purchase outstanding debt through cash purchases, in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will be upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.

The Company has a supplier finance program which provides participating suppliers the option of receiving payment in advance of an invoice due date, to be paid by certain administering banks, on the basis of invoices that the Company has confirmed as valid and approved. The Company s obligation is to make payment in the invoice amount negotiated with participating suppliers, to the administering banks on the invoice due date. The Company s suppliers are not required to participate in the supplier finance program. The early payment transactions between the Company s supplier and the administering bank are subject to an agreement between those parties, and the Company does not participate in any financial aspect of the agreements between the Company s suppliers and the administering banks. The Company has not pledged any assets to the administering bank under the supplier financing program. The Company or the administering bank may terminate the agreement upon at least 30 days written notice. 
 
 The amount of obligations confirmed under the supplier finance program that remain unpaid by the Company were 118.7 million, 105.7 million, and 43.3 million as of September 29, 2024, October 1, 2023 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These obligations are presented within Accounts payable in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The activity related to this program is reflected within the operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

The 252.7 million increase in net cash provided by Operating activities after adjusting for non-cash items, was primarily attributable to improved net income in the first nine months of 2024 compared to first nine months of 2023, and working capital benefits, primarily as a result of the sale of the eOne Film and TV business. 
 
 Net cash utilized for Investing activities was 635.4 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to net cash utilized for Investing activities of 162.6 million in the first nine months of 2023. Additions to property, plant and equipment were 146.2 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 160.4 million in the first nine months of 2023 and purchase of Short-term Investments of 571.0 million in the first nine months of 2024 primarily from the proceeds of the 2034 Notes compared to the prior year with no similar activity. 
 
 Net cash provided by Financing activities was 190.8 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to net cash utilized of 418.0 million in the first nine months of 2023. Financing activities in the first nine months of 2024 primarily include 500.0 million of proceeds from issuance of the 2034 Notes, dividends paid of 292.2 million and 13.0 million of payments related to tax withholdings for stock compensation coinciding with equity award vesting activity. Financing activities in the first nine months of 2023 include 290.9 million of dividends paid, 60.0 million of principal amortization payments toward the Company's Five-Year Tranche loan, which was retired during the fourth quarter of 2023 using the proceeds received from the sale of eOne Film and TV, as well as drawdowns of 117.9 million and repayments of 162.0 million related to production financing loans, all of which were assumed by Lionsgate effective upon the closing of the sale of the eOne Film and TV business in the fourth quarter of 2023, and 15.7 million of payments related to tax withholdings for stock compensation coinciding with equity award vesting activity.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES 
 
 The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As such, management is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. The significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the Company's reported financial results include recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets and income taxes. These critical accounting policies are detailed in the Company's 2023 Form 10-K. 

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
 
 The Company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars and Euros while marketing and selling those products in more than twenty currencies. Results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar, Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Japanese Yen, Brazilian real and Mexican peso and, to a lesser extent, other currencies in Latin America and Asia Pacific countries. 
 
 To manage this exposure, the Company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign exchange option contracts. The Company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or short-term borrowing positions in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company believes, however, that the on-going risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition. In addition, the Company's revenues and costs have been, and will likely continue to be, affected by changes in foreign currency rates. A significant change in foreign exchange rates can materially impact the Company's revenues and earnings due to translation of foreign-denominated revenues and expenses. The Company does not hedge against translation impacts of foreign exchange. From time to time, affiliates of the Company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency. The Company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts. 
 
 The Company reflects derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts. See Note 12 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for further details on the Company's derivatives. 
 
 As of September 29, 2024, the Company had fixed-rate debt of 4.0 billion. The Company may from time to time assess interest rate swaps related to its outstanding debt. The Company did not have any outstanding swaps as of September 29, 2024, October 1, 2023, or December 31, 2023. 
 
 INFLATION 
 
 The impact of inflation on the Company's business operations was significant during the first nine months of 2024 and throughout 2023. The Company monitors the impact of inflation to its business operations on an ongoing basis and may need to implement actions such as price adjustments to mitigate the impact of changes to the rate of inflation in future periods. However, future volatility of general price inflation could affect consumer purchases of our products and spending on entertainment. Additionally, the impact of inflation on costs and availability of materials, costs for shipping and warehousing and other operational overhead, could adversely affect the Company's financial results.

 Business Unit Net Revenue 
 Business Unit Operating Profit Dollars 
 Hasbro Strategic Scorecard 

1.2 Purpose 
 
 The Company has established this PRP for the purpose of providing annual incentive compensation to those employees who contribute significantly to the growth and success of the Company s business to attract and retain, in the employ of the Company, individuals of outstanding ability and to align the interests of employees with the interest of the Company s shareholders. 
 
 1.3 General Guideline 
 
 No employee has any legal entitlement to participate in the PRP or to receive an incentive award under the PRP. 
 
 1.4 Scope 
 
 The PRP is applicable to eligible employees of the Company. 
 
 1.5 Eligibility 
 
 Management shall determine, in its sole discretion, those employees whose duties and responsibilities contribute significantly to the growth and success of the Company s business and are eligible to participate in the PRP. Eligibility to participate in the PRP does not guarantee the receipt of an incentive award under the PRP. Unless otherwise required by law or determined by management, if an employee is eligible to participate in the PRP and or any other annual incentive (or similar) plan implemented from time to time by the Company, such employee may only participate in one plan at the same time, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion. 
 
 Eligible employees will be assigned to the Total Hasbro Plan or a Business Unit Plan for an employee s applicable Business Unit, in each case at the Company s sole discretion. Eligible employees selected to participate in either the Total Hasbro Plan or one of the Business Unit Plans are referred to herein as participants. 
 -3- 

1.1 Incentive Award Levels 
 
 1.2 Target Incentive Award 
 
 Except as otherwise determined by the Company, target incentive awards are expressed as a percentage of earned base salary for the PRP year. For purposes of this PRP, earned base salary means all base compensation for the participant for the fiscal year, which base compensation shall include all base compensation amounts deferred into the Company s retirement savings plan (but excluding any matching or Company contributions made to such plan on the participant s behalf), the Company s Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan and or any similar successor plans for the fiscal year and excludes, where allowed by law, any bonus or other benefits for the fiscal year. By design, the target incentive awards are the award levels that PRP participants are eligible to earn when they, the Company or their applicable Business Unit achieve both their financial and strategic goals and objectives, as applicable. Target incentive awards may be determined by job level, previously determined percentage of earned base salary, or a previously determined fixed percentage or amount. Target incentive awards may also vary by region or Business Area. 
 
 1.3 Maximum Incentive Award 
 
 Under the PRP, the maximum incentive award for participants is 300 of the target incentive award. 
 
 3.0 Measures of Performance 
 
 Total Hasbro - PRP funding for the Total Hasbro Plan is based 80 on Total Hasbro Financial Metric Performance and 20 on the Hasbro Strategic Scorecard, each as described below. 
 
 Business Unit Plans - PRP funding for each of the Business Unit Plans is based 80 on the applicable Business Unit Financial Metric performance and 20 on the Hasbro Strategic Scorecard, each as described below. 
 
 1.1 Establishing Total Hasbro or Business Unit Performance Metrics and Targets 
 
 In the first quarter of the PRP year, the Company s senior management will establish performance metrics and the level of target performance for the year associated with each of the performance metrics for the Total Hasbro Plan and the various Business Unit Plans. Those performance metrics and target levels are reviewed and approved by the Company s Chief Executive Officer CEO and, with respect to any plan in which a Section 16 Officer of the Company participates, by the Company s Board of Directors Board or the Compensation Committee of the Board (the Compensation Committee ). 
 
 -4- 

1.2 Total Hasbro Performance Metrics 
 
 Total Hasbro Financial Metric Performance is measured by Net Revenue and Operating Profit Dollars. Net Revenue and Operating Profit Dollars performance is determined by individually assessing Total Hasbro Financial Metric Performance against the goals for each metric, applying the performance scale and weighting each metric. The Hasbro Strategic Scorecard is assessed by reviewing both quantitative and qualitative factors against each strategic metric individually to determine the overall Hasbro Strategic Scorecard result. The results of both the financial metrics and the Hasbro Strategic Scorecard are then weighted to determine the overall payout factor as set forth below. 

The weightings and definitions of the Total Hasbro Financial Metrics Performance are 
 
 Metric Definition Weighting Net Revenue Third party gross sales (after returns) less sales allowances, plus third-party royalty income, digital gaming revenue, and entertainment revenue 40 Operating Profit Dollars Total earnings from operations excluding non-operating costs, interest expenses or income tax related charges, and other management agreed non-GAAP adjusted charges 40 
 
 The weighting and definition of the Hasbro Strategic Scorecard metric is as follows 
 
 Metric Definition Weighting Cost Savings Net savings from operating model improvements 20 

1.3 Business Unit Performance Metrics 
 
 Each Business Unit will assess financial performance based on Net Revenue and Operating Profit Dollars specific to the respective Business Unit. Business Unit Financial Metrics Performance is determined by individually assessing Business Unit performance against goals for each metric, applying the performance scale, weighting each metric and summing the total. The Hasbro Strategic Scorecard is assessed by reviewing both quantitative and qualitative factors to determine the overall Hasbro Strategic Scorecard result. The results of both the Business Unit Financial Metrics Performance and the Hasbro Strategic Scorecard are then weighted to determine the overall Business Unit payout factor as set forth below.

The weightings and definitions for the Business Unit Financial Metrics Performance are 
 
 Metric Definition Weighting Business Unit Net Revenue As applicable for the respective Business Unit Third party gross sales (after returns) less sales allowances, plus third-party royalty income, digital gaming revenue, and entertainment revenue 40 Business Unit Operating Profit Dollars As applicable for the respective Business Unit Total earnings from operations excluding non-operating costs, interest expenses or income tax related charges, and other management agreed non-GAAP adjusted charges 40 

The weighting and definition for the Hasbro Strategic Scorecard metric is as follows 
 
 Metric Definition Weighting Cost Savings Net savings from operating model improvements 20 
 
 4.0 Development of Funding Pools 
 
 After the end of the fiscal year, the actual performance for Total Hasbro and each of the Business Units will be calculated (based on Total Hasbro and the respective Business Unit s performance against the target goals established for each financial and strategic performance metric as of fiscal year-end) and approved by the Company s Chief Financial Officer. 
 
 The performance scales for the financial metrics for the Total Hasbro Plan and Business Unit Plans, as applicable, are as follows 

-6- 

Metric Weight Category Performance Ranges Minimum Threshold Target Maximum Total Hasbro Net Revenue 40 Achievement 90 100 110 Payout Range 50 100 200 Total Hasbro Operating Profit Dollars 40 Achievement 90 100 115 Payout Range 50 100 200

Strategic Scorecard Performance Scale 
 
 The metrics included on the Hasbro Strategic Scorecard will be assessed using a combination of quantitative and qualitative measures. Achievement will range from 0 to a maximum of 200 . 
 
 In the event that achievement for a financial performance metric is between threshold performance and target performance or between target performance and maximum performance, the applicable funding pool scale percentage, applicable to each PRP plan, will be applied. The performance scales for the Total Hasbro and each Business Unit plan are included in the appendix to this document. 
 
 -7- 

In the case of the Total Hasbro Plan, the financial performance metric must achieve threshold performance, or no award is payable under that metric before the performance scale is applied to the applicable metric. The failure of one financial metric to achieve threshold performance does not impact the other financial metric provided, however, that for funding to occur at least one financial metric must achieve threshold performance. 
 
 In the case of the Business Unit Plans, both financial performance metrics must achieve at least threshold performance, or no award is payable for the Business Unit Financial Metrics Performance component of the respective Business Unit Plan. 
 
 The payout attributable to each performance metric (financial and strategic) will be weighted and added to arrive at the overall achievement which determines the funding pool. 
 
 An illustrative example of the development of a funding pool for the Total Hasbro Plan is as follows 
 
 If Total Hasbro achieves Net Revenue of 100 of target (which results in 100 funding) and Operating Profit Dollars of 90 of target (which results in 50 funding) and the Hasbro strategic scorecard achieves 95 , then the aggregate weighted achievement for the Total Hasbro Plan would be 79 , calculated as follows 
 
 Metric Weight Result Weighted Result Total Hasbro Net Revenue 40 x 100 40 Total Hasbro Operating Profit Dollars 40 x 50 20 Hasbro Strategic Scorecard 20 x 95 19 Final Weighted PRP Performance Factor 79 

Illustrative examples of the development of a funding pool for the TGLE Business Unit Plan are as follows 
 
 If the TGLE Business Unit achieves Net Revenue of 100 of target (which results in 100 funding) and Business Unit Operating Profit Dollars of 65 of target (which is below the 80 threshold), the Business Unit component of the respective Business Unit Plan will not fund (0 funding). In this scenario, the funding pool, if any, will be determined solely by the Hasbro Strategic Scorecard component of the Business Unit Plans. 
 
 or 
 
 -8- 

If the TGLE Business Unit achieves Net Revenue of 90 of target (which results in 50 funding), and Operating Profit Dollars of 100 of target (which results in 100 funding), the aggregate weighted achievement for the Business Unit component of the TGLE Plan would be 60 , combined with the Hasbro Strategic Scorecard component (95 achievement), would be 79 , calculated as follows 
 
 Metric Weight Result Weighted Result TGLE Net Revenue 40 x 50 20 TGLE Operating Profit Dollars 40 x 100 40 Hasbro Strategic Scorecard 20 x 95 19 Final Weighted PRP Performance Factor 79 
 
 If the WOTC Business Unit achieves Net Revenue of 100 of target (which results in 100 funding), and Operating Profit Dollars of 115 of target (which results in 200 funding), the aggregate weighted achievement for the Business Unit component of the WOTC Plan would be 120 , combined with the Hasbro Strategic Scorecard component (95 achievement), would be 139 , calculated as follows 

Metric Weight Result Weighted Result WOTC Net Revenue 40 x 100 40 WOTC Operating Profit Dollars 40 x 200 80 Hasbro Strategic Scorecard 20 x 95 19 Final Weighted PRP Performance Factor 139 
 
 If the Commercial Business Unit achieves Net Revenue of 125 of target (which results in 300 funding), and Operating Profit Dollars of 100 of target (which results in 100 funding), the aggregate weighted achievement for the Business Unit component of the Commercial Plan would be 160 , combined with the Hasbro Strategic Scorecard component (95 achievement), would be 179 , calculated as follows 
 
 -9- 

Metric Weight Result Weighted Result Commercial Net Revenue 40 x 300 120 Commercial Operating Profit Dollars 40 x 100 40 Hasbro Strategic Scorecard 20 x 95 19 Final Weighted PRP Performance Factor 179 
 
 Once all the Business Unit results have been calculated, the funding pool of each respective Business Unit is developed. The Business Unit component funding pool for each of the Business Units (weighted at 80 ), combined with the Hasbro strategic scorecard funding pool (weighted at 20 ), will equal the aggregate of the PRP funding pool for the respective Business Unit Plan. 

4.1 Funding Pools 
 
 The Company calculates the Total Hasbro Plan funding pool based on the Company s Financial Metric Performance through the end of the fiscal year against the applicable performance targets and the Hasbro Strategic Scorecard Total Hasbro Plan Funding Pool ). The Company calculates the funding pool for the Business Unit Plans based on Business Unit Financial Metric Performance through the end of the fiscal year against applicable financial performance targets for the respective Business Unit and performance against the Hasbro Strategic Scorecard (the Business Unit Funding Pool ). The aggregate pool for all Business Unit Plans, together with the Total Hasbro Plan Funding Pool, is referred to hereinafter as the Funding Pool . 
 
 The CEO and the Compensation Committee reserve the right to alter the Funding Pool after year end, but prior to the actual payment of awards to participants in the PRP. 
 
 4.2 High Performer Pool 
 
 Following the end of the year, but prior to the payment of all awards under the PRP, management of the Company, in its sole discretion, may determine it appropriate to reward high-performing Company employees through an additional funding pool (the High Performer Pool ). Funding of the High Performer Pool is determined by the achievement of the Company s Operating Profit Dollars, overall Company or reporting Business Unit performance and affordability. The aggregate amount of the High Performer Pool is subject to Compensation Committee approval. 
 -10- 

4.3 Total Awards Under the PRP 
 
 The aggregate of all incentive awards under the PRP shall consist of the sum of the Funding Pool and the High Performer Pool. 
 
 4.4. Management Review 
 
 Payment of any incentive award to an employee is subject to management s review. For purposes of the PRP, management has the ability to review the proposed payout of any incentive award under the PRP to an eligible employee and to determine whether such proposed incentive award should be adjusted based on the participant s performance, contributions to the organization, or any other factor not prohibited by applicable law. In completing this review, management has the option of providing a zero-value incentive award to the employee regardless of Total Hasbro or Business Unit performance. For participants that do not receive an incentive award or that receive a reduced incentive award, including for any of the reasons set forth in Section 5.0 below, the portion of such employee s potential incentive award that might have been reflected in the Funding Pool will remain in the Funding Pool and be allocated to other PRP participants in the manner determined by management. 
 
 5.0 Removals, Transfers, Terminations, Promotions and Hiring Eligibility 
 
 Except to the extent applicable legal requirements or the terms of an employment agreement mandate a different result, the following scenarios will be addressed under the PRP in the manner set forth below. 
 
 5.1 Participants whose employment with the Company is terminated because of retirement or disability 
 
 (i) After the close of the PRP year, but prior to the actual distribution of incentive awards for such year, may be awarded an incentive award for the plan year at the discretion of the EVP and Chief People Officer. 
 
 (ii) After the beginning, but prior to the close of the PRP year, no award shall be granted unless authorized at the discretion of the EVP and Chief People Officer. 
 
 5.2 Participants whose employment with the Company is terminated because of death 
 
 (i) After the close of the PRP year, but prior to the actual distribution of awards for such year, shall be awarded an incentive award. Such payment will be made to the deceased employee s estate. 
 
 -11- 

(ii) After the beginning, but prior to the close of the PRP year, no award shall be granted unless authorized at the discretion of the EVP and Chief People Officer. Any such payments will be made to the deceased employee s estate. 
 
 1.3 Participants who resign for any reason during the PRP year or after the close of the PRP year, but prior to the distribution of incentive awards for such year, will not receive an incentive award for any PRP year. 
 
 1.4 Participants who are terminated from the employ of the Company or any of its subsidiaries for cause or for any offense involving moral turpitude or an offense involving breach of the fiduciary duty owed by the individual to the Company will not be entitled to an incentive award for any PRP year. 
 
 1.5 Participants who are terminated from the employ of the Company or any of its subsidiaries due to any reason other than the ones enumerated above, including, without limitation, employees who are discharged due to job elimination 
 
 (i) After the close of the PRP year, but prior to the actual distribution of incentive awards for such year, may be awarded an incentive award. No award shall be granted unless authorized at the discretion of the EVP and Chief People Officer. 
 
 (ii) After the beginning, but prior to the close of the PRP year, the employee is no longer eligible for that year. However, a discretionary incentive award may be granted by the EVP and Chief People Officer. 
 
 5.6 Participants under statutory or contractual notices 
 
 (i) At the end of the fiscal year, except as may be required by contract or applicable law, no award shall be granted unless authorized at the discretion of the EVP and Chief People Officer. 
 
 (ii) Which ends prior to the close of the PRP year, shall not be eligible for an incentive award for that plan year except as may be required by contract or applicable law. However, a discretionary incentive award may be granted by the EVP and Chief People Officer. 
 
 1.7 Participants transferred during the PRP year from one division or business unit of the Company to another where such transfer results in the participant being assigned to different plans during the same PRP year (e.g., from the Total Hasbro Plan to a Business Unit Plan from a Business Unit Plan to the Total Hasbro Plan or from a Business Unit Plan to a different Business Unit Plan), will be eligible to receive an incentive award (subject to achievement of the requisite performance) 
 -12- 

under the plan associated with such employee s position at the end of the PRP year, but the award amount may be based on the performance of the respective plans associated with the employee s positions during the same PRP year, in such amount and in such manner as determined in the sole discretion of the EVP and Chief People Officer. 
 
 1.8 Employees hired during the PRP year must be actively employed on or before October 1 st or another date designated by the EVP and Chief People Officer of the PRP year to participate in the PRP for that PRP year. Incentive awards will be made based upon the employee's earned base salary during the period of their employment with the Company during the PRP year. 
 
 1.9 The eligibility for an incentive award under the PRP for employees who remain employed with the Company during the PRP year but whose change in employment status through promotion or reclassification affects their level of participation 
 
 (i) Prior to October 1 st or another date designated by the EVP and Chief People Officer, of the PRP year, will participate at the level consistent with the promotion or reclassification. 
 
 (ii) After October 1 st or another date designated by the EVP and Chief People Officer, but prior to the close of the PRP year, will participate at the level consistent with their classification prior to the promotion or reclassification. 
 
 1.10 The eligibility for an incentive award under the PRP for employees who remain employed with the Company during the PRP year but whose change in employment status through demotion affects their level of participation will be determined in the sole discretion of the EVP and Chief People Officer. 
 
 1.1 Administration of the PRP 
 
 1.2 Amendments to the PRP (Contingency Clause) 
 
 The CEO and the Compensation Committee reserve the right to interpret, amend, modify, or terminate the PRP in accordance with changing conditions at any time in their sole discretion. 
 
 1.3 Incentive Award Distribution 
 
 Incentive awards, when payable, shall be paid as near to the close of the Company s fiscal year as may be feasible. Participants in the PRP must be employed at the time of award distribution in order to receive an incentive award, except as otherwise provided herein. 
 
 No individual has the right to receive an incentive award until it has been approved and distributed in accordance with the provisions of the PRP. 
 -13- 

1.4 Non-Assignment of Awards 
 
 Participants eligible to receive incentive awards shall not have any right to pledge, assign, or otherwise dispose of any unpaid or projected awards. 
 
 1.5 Deferral of Awards 
 
 Participants eligible to defer incentive awards through the Deferred Compensation Program (DCP) may elect to do so during the annual DCP enrollment. 
 
 1.6 Clawback of Awards 
 
 By accepting any incentive award under the Plan, the participant acknowledges and agrees that any incentive compensation the participant is awarded is subject to the Hasbro, Inc. Clawback Policy, as it may be amended from time to time by the Board. Such acknowledgement and agreement is a material condition to receiving any incentive award under the Plan, which would not have been awarded to the participant otherwise. 
 
 1.7 Stock Ownership 
 
 Additionally, the participant acknowledges and agrees that if the participant is now, or becomes subject in the future to, the Hasbro, Inc. Executive Stock Ownership Policy, as it may be amended from time to time by the Board (the Stock Ownership Policy ), then the receipt of any incentive award under the PRP is contingent upon the participant s compliance with the terms of the Stock Ownership Policy, including without limitation, the requirement to retain an amount equal to at least 50 of the net shares received as a result of the exercise, vesting or payment of any equity awards granted until the Participant s applicable requirement levels are met. Failure to comply with the Stock Ownership Policy may, in the Company s sole discretion, result in the reduction or total elimination of any incentive award that otherwise might be payable under the PRP and or result in the Company determining to substitute other forms of compensation, such as equity, for any award the participant otherwise might have received under the PRP.
