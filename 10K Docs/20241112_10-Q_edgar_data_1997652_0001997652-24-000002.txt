(excluding assets held for sale); 
 an accumulated deficit of since inception; and 
 significant expenditures planned for the unproved properties in the next 12 months. 
 These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Group s ability to continue as a going concern for the 12 months 
 following the date these condensed consolidated financial statements were available for issuance. The continuation of the 
 Group as a going concern is dependent upon the ability of the Group to obtain necessary additional capital to fund ongoing 
 exploration, appraisal and development projects and/or obtain gas producing properties to attain future profitable 
 operations. No assurance can be given that the Group will be successful in these efforts in the future. 
 Management has several plans in various stages of progress to source additional funding to provide operating capital 
 for continued growth of the Group. Therefore, these condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any 
 adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets and liabilities that might be necessary should

joint venture between the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary 
 Tamboran (West) Pty Ltd TR West ), and Daly Waters Energy, LP ("DWE") governed by the amended and restated joint 
 venture and shareholders agreement dated June 3, 2024 (the TB1 Joint Venture Agreement ). In assessing the primary 
 beneficiary of TB1, the Company determined the primary activities that most significantly impact the economic 
 performance of TB1 include serving as the manager, determining the strategy and direction of TB1, and the power to create 
 a budget. 
 The Company was appointed as the manager to manage and carry out day-to-day operations which supports the basis 
 of Tamboran as the primary beneficiary. The Company, as manager, also prepares the work plans and budget of TB1. As 
 such it was determined that the Company has the power to direct TB1 s activities that most significantly impact TB1 s 
 economic performance. As a result of the assessment performed, the results of TB1 have been included in the 
 accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. TB1 has no assets that are collateral for or restricted solely to 
 settle its obligations. The creditors of TB1 do not have recourse to the Group s general credit. 
 The Company also assessed which party to the TB1 Joint Venture Agreement has the obligation to absorb losses or 
 the right to receive the benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The future profits and losses of 
 TB1 are shared by the Company and DWE in proportion to their respective equity interest in TB1, however, to date the 
 Company has contributed a greater proportion of the capital and has no ability to recoup any of the excess funding the 
 Company has made to TB1 from DWE and therefore has a greater exposure to absorb losses. 
 A loan was provided to TR West from Tamboran Resources Pty Ltd (formerly known as Tamboran Resources 
 Limited) ("TR Ltd."), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The loan was used by TR West to acquire its interest in 
 TB1. On November 9, 2022 , TB1 completed the acquisition of a share of Beetaloo Basin assets, EP 76, EP 98, and 
 EP 117. As a result of the TB1 Joint Venture Agreement, the Company and DWE each beneficially acquired a 
 interest in the permits for the total undivided interest of . Falcon Oil and Gas Australia limited ("Falcon") holds the 
 remaining undivided interest of in the assets (collectively known as the "Beetaloo Joint Venture"). 
 On March 4, 2024 , Falcon, the owner of the remaining interest in the Beetaloo Joint Venture assets, capped its 
 participation to in the Beetaloo Joint Venture s second Shenandoah South well pad SS2 ). On March 21, 2024 , 
 Tamboran B2 Pty Ltd ("TB1 Operator") (a wholly owned subsidiary of TB1 in which the Company has a interest) 
 agreed to pick up Falcon s interest, increasing TB1 Operator s working interest to at least in the wells drilled from the 
 SS2 well pad.

 agreement, the Group has the right to place the drilling rig on a temporary suspension rate between wells for a period up to

 Restricted Stock Units 
 On August 6, 2024, the Group adopted the 2024 Incentive Award Plan (the "2024 Plan"). As of September 30, 2024 , 
 the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the 2024 Plan was shares. 
 The 2024 Plan , allows, among other things, for the grant of Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs"). On August 6, 2024, the 
 Group issued RSUs to certain eligible service providers, employees and executive officers (the participants to provide 
 them an opportunity to participate in the growth and profits of the Group and to attract, motivate, and retain their services 
 to promote the long-term success of the Group. 
 On August 6, 2024, the Company granted Restricted Stock Units Retention Awards to its employees in 
 Australia and U.S. The Retention Awards granted to Australian employees entitle them to CHESS Depository Interests 
 ("CDIs") representing shares of common stock (each CDI represents 1/ th of a share of common stock). 
 Similarly, the Retention Awards granted to U.S. employees entitle them to shares of common stock. The vesting 
 conditions state that all Retention Awards will vest in full on December 31, 2025, provided the employee remain in service 
 as of the vesting date. The fair value at grant date of the Retention Awards was per common stock and per 
 CDI. 
 On August 6, 2024, the Company also granted Restricted Stock Units IPO Awards to its employees in 
 Australia and U.S. The IPO Awards granted to Australian employees entitle them to CDIs representing shares of 
 common stock. Similarly, the IPO Awards granted to U.S. employees entitle them to shares of common stock. The 
 IPO Awards will vest in following three tranches: 
 Tranche 1 IPO Awards granted to Australian and U.S. employees will vest in full on July 3, 2027, 
 provided the employee remains in service as of the vesting date. The fair value at grant date of Tranche 1 was 
 per common stock and per CDI. 
 Tranche 2 IPO Awards granted to Australian and U.S. employees will vest subject to the completion 
 of the Group s Phase 1 Development Plan to establish first production of the Shenandoah South Pilot Project

per common stock and per CDI. 
 Tranche 3 IPO Awards granted to Australian and U.S. employees will vest subject to the Company s 
 Total Shareholder Return TSR reaching or exceeding the 75th percentile of the Benchmark Index TSR 
 between July 3, 2027, and July 3, 2029. TSR will be measured against the S P SmallCap 600 Energy (or any 
 other market index determined by the Board in their sole discretion) Benchmark Index over the same 
 performance measurement period. The fair value at grant date of Tranche 3 was per common stock and 
 per CDI 
 The grant date fair value of the Tranche 3 RSUs were determined through the use of the Monte Carlo simulation 
 method. This method requires the use of subjective assumptions such as the price and the expected volatility of the 
 Company s common stock and its self-determined peer group companies stock, risk free rate of return, and cross- 
 correlations between the Company and its peer group companies. Expected volatilities for the Company and each peer 
 company utilized in the model are estimated using a historical period consistent with the awards remaining performance 
 period as of the grant date. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield on U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity for a term 
 consistent with the remaining performance period. The valuation model assumes dividends, if any, are immediately 
 reinvested. 

Expected volatility 

Risk-free interest rate 

The Retention Awards and IPO Awards entitle the participants to receive the equivalent value (in cash or shares of 
 common stock/CDIs) of dividends paid on shares of common stock and CDIs, respectively. 
 The RSUs are not transferable. There are no participation rights or entitlements inherent in the RSUs and the 
 participants will not be entitled to participate in new issues of capital offered to stockholders or holders of CDIs. 
 If the Company makes a bonus issue of common stock, CDIs, or other securities to existing stockholders or holders

 EP 161 
 For the McArthur working interest, we are obligated to contribute our share of expenses to uphold our stake in EP 
 161. Our commitment through March 2026 is expected to be based on the minimum work requirements. There 
 are no minimum commitment requirements after March 2026. 
 Beetaloo Joint Venture 
 The terms of the Beetaloo Joint Venture necessitate specific minimum work obligations through May 2028 . These 
 commitments include an expected spend of related to drilling and multi-stage hydraulic fracturing of 
 wells, 2D seismic survey, and subsurface studies, with expenditure across EP 76 of , EP 98 of and 
 EP 117 of . An application was submitted to DME on September 26, 2024 to vary the year 2 and 3 work 
 program, and is currently pending resol ution. 
 Midstream 
 Procurement of the long lead items for the SPCF compressor package and dehydration package were placed in June 
 2024 with progress payments of required prior to the end of 2025. 
 Environmental 
 The Group s operations are subject to risks normally associated with the drilling, completion and production of oil 
 and gas, including blowouts, fires, and environmental risks such as oil spills or gas leaks that could expose the Group to 
 liabilities associated with these risks. 
 In the Group s acquisition of existing or previously drilled well bores, the Group may not be aware of prior 
 environmental safeguards, if any, that were taken at the time such wells were drilled or during such time the wells were 
 operated. The Group maintains comprehensive insurance coverage that it believes is adequate to mitigate the risk of any 
 adverse financial effects associated with these risks. 
 However, should it be determined that a liability exists with respect to any environmental cleanup or restoration, the 
 liability to cure such a violation could still fall upon the Group. No claim has been made, nor is the Group aware of any 
 liability which the Group may have, as it relates to any environmental cleanup, restoration, or the violation of any rules or 
 regulations relating thereto except for the matter discussed above. 
 Legal Proceedings 
 The Group is a party to legal proceedings encountered in the ordinary course of its business. While the ultimate 
 outcome and impact to the Group cannot be predicted with certainty, in the opinion of management, it is remote that these 
 legal proceedings will have a material adverse impact on the Group s condensed consolidated financial condition, results of 

shareholders identified as related parties, H P and Mr. Bryan Sheffield. The 
 transactions during the three months ended September 30, 2024 are as follows. 
 H P 
 During the year ended June 30, 2023 , the Group entered into a strategic alliance with H P and secured a 
 equity investment from H P (and as a consequence, a member of the H P Executive Leadership Team was 
 appointed as a director of the Group). The strategic alliance resulted in H P supporting the Group s development plans in 
 NT Australia through their equity investment in the Company while at the same time executing on H P s strategy to gain 
 more international exposure through the use of drilling rigs in Australia.

 R D expenditure, which is expected to result in a cash refund o f . The amount has not been recorded as a 
 receivable as it is not virtually certain. 
 SPCF 
 In October 2024 , the Group entered into a Unit Holders and Shareholders Deed with DWE for the establishment of a 
 trust to be owned / 50 by the Group and DWE to own the SPCF. 
 Also in October 2024 , the Group signed a contract with Enscope Pty Ltd ("Enscope"), an Australian engineering

CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. 
 Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of 
 future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future 
 of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future 
 conditions. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as: anticipate, intend, plan, goal, 
 commit, seek, believe, project, estimate, expect, strategy, future, likely, may, should, will and 
 similar references to future periods. 
 It is possible that the future financial performance of Tamboran Resources Corporation (the Company may 
 differ from expectations due to a variety of factors, including but not limited to: our early stage of development with no 
 material revenue expected until 2026 and our limited operating history; the substantial additional capital required for our 
 business plan, which we may be unable to raise on acceptable terms; our strategy to deliver natural gas to the Australian 
 East Coast and select Asian markets being contingent upon constructing additional pipeline capacity, which may not be 
 secured; the absence of proved reserves and the risk that our drilling may not yield natural gas in commercial quantities or 
 quality; the speculative nature of drilling activities, which involve significant costs and may not result in discoveries or 
 additions to our future production or reserves; the challenges associated with importing U.S. practices and technology to 
 the Northern Territory, which could affect our operations and growth due to limited local experience; the critical need for 
 timely access to appropriate equipment and infrastructure, which may impact our market access and business plan 
 execution; the operational complexities and inherent risks of drilling, completions, workover, and hydraulic fracturing 
 operations that could adversely affect our business; the volatility of natural gas prices and its potential adverse effect on our 
 financial condition and operations; the risks of construction delays, cost overruns, and negative effects on our financial and 
 operational performance associated with midstream projects; the potential fundamental impact on our business if our 
 assessments of the Beetaloo are materially inaccurate; the concentration of all our assets and operations in the Beetaloo, 
 making us susceptible to region-specific risks; the substantial doubt raised by our recurring operational losses, negative 
 cash flows, and cumulative net losses about our ability to continue as a going concern; complex laws and regulations that 
 could affect our operational costs and feasibility or lead to significant liabilities; community opposition that could result in 
 costly delays and impede our ability to obtain necessary government approvals; exploration and development activities in 
 the Beetaloo that may lead to legal disputes, operational disruptions, and reputational damage due to native title and 
 heritage issues; the requirement to produce natural gas on a Scope 1 net zero basis upon commencement of commercial 
 production, with internal goals for operational net zero, which may increase our production costs; the increased attention to 
 environmental, social and governance ESG matters and environmental conservation measures that could adversely 
 impact our business operations; risks related to our corporate structure; risks related to our common stock and CDIs; and 
 the other risk factors discussed in the this report and the Company s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
 (the SEC ). 
 It is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors. Any forward-looking statements in this report are based on 
 certain assumptions and analyses made by the Company in light of its experience and perception of historical trends, 
 current conditions, expected future developments, and other factors it believes are appropriate in the circumstances. 
 Forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of future performance and actual results or developments may differ 
 materially from expectations. While the Company continually reviews trends and uncertainties affecting the Company s 
 results of operations and financial condition, the Company does not assume any obligation to update or supplement any 
 particular forward-looking statements contained in this report, except as required by law. 
 Additionally, certain forward-looking and other statements in this report or other locations, such as the Company s 
 corporate website, regarding ESG matters are informed by various ESG standards and frameworks (which may include 
 standards for the measurement of underlying data) and the interests of various stakeholders. Accordingly, such information 
 may not be, and should not be interpreted as necessarily being material under the federal securities laws for SEC 
 reporting purposes, even if the Company uses the word material or materiality in such discussions. ESG information is 
 also often reliant on third-party information or methodologies that are subject to evolving expectations and best practices, 
 and the Company s approach to and discussion of these matters may continue to evolve as well. For example, the 
 Company s disclosures may change due to revisions in framework requirements, availability of information, changes in its 
 business or applicable governmental policies, or other factors, some of which may be beyond its control.

Quarters Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Revenue and other operating income . We have not yet commenced natural gas production, therefore, we 
 did not earn any revenue and other operating income during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , 
 respectively. 
 Compensation and benefits, including stock-based compensation . Compensation and benefits, including 
 stock based compensation, increased by 1.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 , as 
 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 , due primarily to the restricted stock units granted during 
 the period and increased headcount as compared to the comparative period. 
 Consultancy, legal and professional fees . Consultancy, legal and professional fees increased by 0.3 
 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to the three months ended September 30, 

23 

Table of Contents 

2023 , due to increased professional fees related to U.S. GAAP financial statements. This scope of work was not 
 commenced until subsequent to September 30, 2023 in the prior fiscal year. 
 Lo ss on remeasurement of fair value of assets classified as held for sale. The Group recognized a loss on 
 assets classified as held for sale amounting to 0.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 , due 
 to a write down of rig 403 to the fair value less costs to sell in the current period, which did not occur in the 
 comparative period. 
 Accretion of asset retirement obligations expense . For the three months ended September 30, 2024 , an 
 expense for accretion of asset retirement obligations of 0.3 million was recognized. The recognition of such an 
 expense was due to the accretion of asset retirement obligation liabilities in relation to all EPs, inclusive of EPs 76, 
 98, 117, 136 and 161, as well as SPCF for the new well and related well pads drilled during the period. 
 Exploration expense . Exploration expense increased by 0.1 million during the three months ended 
 September 30, 2024 , as compared to three months ended September 30, 2023 , due to increased activity for 
 topographical, geographical and geophysical studies and other indirect expenditure. 
 General and administrative. General and administrative costs increased by 0.9 million during the three 
 months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 , as a result of 
 increased expenses related to travel, insurance, and office and administrative fees. 
 Interest income, net . Interest income, net increased by 0.7 million during the three months ended 
 September 30, 2024 , as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 , due to interest received from term 
 deposits during the period ended September 30, 2024. 
 Foreign currency translation . For the three months ended September 30, 2024 , we recognized a foreign 
 currency translation gain of 12.1 million , primarily due to the strengthening of the Australian Dollar as of 
 September 30, 2024, as compared to July 1, 2024. In the three months ended September 30, 2023 , we recognized a 
 foreign currency translation loss of 5.3 million , primarily due to the weakening of the Australian Dollar as of 
 September 30, 2023, as compared to July 1, 2023. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement 
 of foreign currency transactions and from the translation at fiscal year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and 
 liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized on our condensed consolidated statement of operations 
 and comprehensive loss. 
 Income tax expense . We have no income tax expense due to operating losses incurred for the three months 
 ended September 30, 2024 , and 2023 . We have provided a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset 
 because management has determined that it is more likely than not that we will not earn income sufficient to realize 
 the deferred tax assets during a foreseeable future period. Management will continue to assess the potential for 
 realizing deferred tax assets based upon income forecast data and the feasibility of future tax planning strategies and 
 may record adjustments to the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in future periods, as appropriate, that 
 could have a material impact on the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We are a development stage enterprise and will continue to be so until commencement of substantial 
 production from our natural gas properties. We do not expect to generate any revenue from production until 2026, at 
 the earliest, which will depend upon successful drilling results, additional and timely capital funding, and access to 
 suitable infrastructure. Until then our primary sources of liquidity are expected to be cash on hand, net proceeds 
 from our IPO, and funds from future private and public equity placements, debt funding and asset sales. 
 We expect to incur substantial expenses and generate significant operating losses as we continue to develop 
 our natural gas prospects and as we: 
 complete our current appraisal drilling and testing program; 
 develop and commercialize our assets, including development of pipelines, the proposed NT LNG 
 facility and other infrastructure; 

24 

Table of Contents 

opportunistically invest in additional natural gas assets adjacent to our current positions; and 
 incur expenses related to operating as a public company and compliance with regulatory requirements. 
 Our future financial condition and liquidity will be impacted by, among other factors, the success of our 
 exploration and appraisal drilling program, the number of commercially viable natural gas discoveries made, the 
 quantities of natural gas discovered, the speed with which we can bring such discoveries to production, and the 
 actual cost of exploration, appraisal and development of our prospects. 
 For the remainder of fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 , we estimate that we will need to invest approximately 
 70.0 million to progress our development plans. We expect the additional proceeds from the rig 403 asset sale, 
 received in October 2024, together with our existing cash on hand, to be sufficient to fund our planned drilling and 
 flow testing of SS-2H and SS-3H. However, we may require significant additional funds earlier than we currently 
 expect in order to execute our strategy as planned. Additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable 
 terms or at all. In addition, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our 
 stockholders. For example, if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity securities, further dilution to our 
 existing stockholders will result. If we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we may be required to 
 significantly curtail one or more of our planned activities. We also could be required to seek funds through 
 arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our assets which we 
 would otherwise develop on our own, or with a majority working interest.

 14.7 million. 
 A variation application for EP 143 was submitted to DME in August 2024, and approved in October 2024. 
 The total minimum work program commitments remain the same at 9.6 million with activity and associated spend 
 being transferred within the license term. 
 EP 161 
 For the McArthur working interest, we are obligated to contribute our share of expenses to uphold our stake in 
 EP 161. Our commitment through March 2026 is approximatel y 2.8 million b ased on the minimum work 
 requirements. There are no minimum commitment requirements after March 2026. 
 Beetaloo Joint Venture 
 The terms of the Beetaloo Joint Venture necessitate specific minimum work obligations through May 2028 . 
 These commitments include an expected spend of 65.5 million related to drilling and multi-stage hydraulic 
 fracturing of five wells, 2D seismic survey, and subsurface studies, with expenditure across EP 76 of 22.3 million , 
 EP 98 of 20.9 million , and EP 117 of 22.3 million . An application was submitted to DME on September 26, 2024 
 to vary the year 2 and 3 work program, and is currently pending resolution.

Net Cash Used in Operating Activities 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 , net cash used in operating activities was 4.2 million 
 during which we incurred a net loss of 6.8 million , compared to net cash used in operating activities for the three 
 months ended September 30, 2023 , of 3.3 million , during which we incurred a net loss of 3.8 million The net loss 
 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , included the non-cash impacts of depreciation and amortization, 
 stock-based compensation, loss on remeasurement of assets classified as held for sale, accretion of asset retirement 
 obligations, and foreign exchange differences. Additionally, in the three months ended September 30, 2024 , net 
 favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities totaled 0.6 million , primarily consisting of a 0.2 million 
 decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to timing of our pay cycle during the fiscal period, a 0.9 
 million decrease in trade and other receivables, and a 0.2 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets. 
 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 , net cash used in investing activities was 14.5 million 
 compared to 18.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . In the period ended September 30, 2024,

Table of Contents 

there was spend on exploration and evaluation activities of 12.2 million in connection with the drilling of the SS2- 
 H pilot well, expenditure of 2.7 million related to the detailed design of SPCF, offset by the non-refundable 
 advance payment of 0.4 million for rig 403. 
 Net Cash from Financing Activities 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 , net cash received in financing activities was 16.7 million 
 compared to 34.4 million received for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . This change was primarily due 
 to the receipt of 7.4 million in gross proceeds from the greenshoe option exercised in July 2024, 11.5 million 
 attributable to contributions from noncontrolling interest holders in connection with investments by DWE, partially 
 offset by transaction costs of 2.1 million . 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our 
 condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The 
 preparation of our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and 
 assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets 
 and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the 
 reporting period. The following critical accounting policies relate to the more significant estimates and assumptions 
 used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. 
 The impact of, and any associated risks related to, estimates and assumptions are discussed within 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as in the Notes to 
 the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, if applicable, where estimates and assumptions affect the 
 Company s reported and expected financial results. 
 There have been no other material changes in critical accounting estimates at September 30, 2024 from those 
 described in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Not required. 
 
 Item 4. Controls an d Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024 , our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that we 
 did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting due to the material weakness that was disclosed in 
 our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024 . 
 As discussed in Part II, Item 9A, Controls and Procedures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 
 year ended June 30, 2024 , we identified the following deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, 
 which in the aggregate, constituted a material weakness: 
 i) lack of sufficient evidence retained of the performance of internal controls, 
 ii) insufficient resources in key accounting and finance roles leading to inadequate segregation of duties, 
 iii) lack of manage access and manage change IT general controls over the cloud-based enterprise resource 
 planning system, and 
 iv) accounting for complex transactions in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

27 

Table of Contents 

Status of Remediation Efforts 
 In response to the material weakness identified and described above, our management, with the oversight of 
 the Audit Risk Management Committee of our Board of Directors, will continue to dedicate significant efforts and 
 resources to further improve our control environment and to take steps to remediate this material weakness. As part 
 of our plan to address this material weakness, we are performing a full review, with the assistance of external 
 consultants, of our processes and internal controls. We have implemented, and plan to continue to implement, new 
 controls and processes. We will also provide training to control owners, supported by external consultants, as 
 appropriate, in support of an effective internal control framework, including how to sufficiently document and 
 evidence the operation of internal controls. We will also continue to hire accounting, finance and cyber security 
 personnel who possess the required technical knowledge to ensure reporting requirements are met and segregation of 
 duties are maintained. Finally, we have implemented a new enterprise resource planning system to better support our 
 financial reporting, including any related internal controls. 
 While we have begun implementing a plan to remediate this material weakness, we cannot predict the 
 success of such plan or the outcome of our assessment of this plan at this time. If our steps are insufficient to 
 successfully remediate the material weakness and otherwise establish and maintain an effective system of internal 
 control over financial reporting, the reliability of our financial reporting, investor confidence in us, and the value of 
 our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. We can give no assurance that this implementation 
 will remediate this deficiency in internal control or that additional material weaknesses in our internal control over 
 financial reporting will not be identified in the future. Our failure to implement and maintain effective internal 
 control over financial reporting could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of 
 our financial statements, or cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations. For as long as we are an 
 emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be 
 required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Except for the implementation of our remediation plans in connection with our ineffective disclosure

Part II - Other Information 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Other than given as below, as of the date of this report, we are not a party to any material pending legal 
 proceedings, nor are we aware of any material civil proceeding or government authority contemplating any legal 
 proceeding, and to our knowledge, no such proceedings by or against us have been threatened. We anticipate that we and 
 our subsidiaries may from time to time in the future become subject to claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary 
 course of business. It is not feasible to predict the outcome of any such proceedings, and we cannot assure that their 
 ultimate disposition will not have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of 
 operations. 
 On July 4, 2024, the Environment Centre Northern Territory ECNT lodged an Originating Application in the 
 Northern Territory Civil and Administrative Appeals Tribunal NTCAT for a merits review of the Minister for 
 Environment, Climate Change and Water Security s Minister s approval of TB1 Operator s Shenandoah South 
 Exploration Appraisal Program EP98 and EP117 Environment Management Plan Shenandoah EMP ( NTCAT 
 Merits Review ). On August 20, 2024 the TB1 Operator was added as a respondent to the NTCAT Merits Review. The 
 NTCAT Merits Review commenced by ECNT under the Petroleum Act 1984 (NT) and the Petroleum (Environment) 
 Regulations 2016 (NT). ECNT are seeking an order that the Minister s Original Decision is set aside and substituted with a 
 decision that the Tribunal Member is not satisfied the information provided in the Shenandoah EMP is sufficiently 
 compliant with the Petroleum (Environment) Regulations 2016 (NT), including in relation to: (a) risks of wastewater spills 
 and (b) risks in relation to inter-aquifer connectivity and an order that the Shenandoah EMP should be referred to the NT 
 EPA for an independent assessment or, in the alternative, an order that varies the Minister s original decision and 
 establishes conditions in the Shenandoah EMP.
