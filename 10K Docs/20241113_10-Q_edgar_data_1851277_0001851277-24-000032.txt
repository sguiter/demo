 (2) Dividends declared per Share was calculated as the sum of dividends declared during the period divided by the number of Shares outstanding at the date of the relevant transactions (refer to Note 8, Net Assets, to these unaudited consolidated financial statements). 
 (3) Decrease is due to the offering price of subscriptions during the period (See Note 8, Net Assets, to these unaudited consolidated financial statements). 
 (4) Total return based on net asset value (not annualized) is based on the change in net asset value per Share during the year plus the declared dividends on Shares, assuming reinvestment of dividends in accordance with the dividend reinvestment plan, divided by the beginning net asset value for the period. 
 (5) These ratios to average net assets have not been annualized.

 As of a mutually agreed date no earlier than 48 hours (excluding Sundays and holidays) prior to the Effective Time (such date, the Determination Date ), each of the Company and CGBD will deliver to the other a calculation of its net asset value NAV as of such date (such calculation with respect to the Company, the Closing CSL III Net Asset Value and such calculation with respect to CGBD, the Closing CGBD Net Asset Value ), in each case using a pre-agreed set of assumptions, methodologies and adjustments. Based on such calculations, the parties will calculate the CSL III Per Share NAV , which will be equal to the quotient of (i) the Closing CSL III Net Asset Value and (ii) the number of CSL III Common Shares issued and outstanding as of the Determination Date (excluding any Cancelled Shares), and the CGBD Per Share NAV , which will be equal to the quotient of (i) the Closing CGBD Net Asset Value and (ii) the number of shares of the CGBD Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the Determination Date (taking into account the shares of the CGBD Common Stock to be issued as a result of the Preferred Stock Exchange (as defined below) as if the Preferred Stock Exchange had occurred as of the Determination Date).

CSL III Per Share NAV / CGBD Per Share NAV The Company and CGBD will update and redeliver the Closing CSL III Net Asset Value or the Closing CGBD Net Asset Value, respectively, in the event the closing of the Mergers is subsequently materially delayed or there is a material change to such calculation between the Determination Date and the closing of the Mergers and if needed to ensure that the calculation is determined within 48 hours (excluding Sundays and holidays) prior to the Effective Time. 
 Immediately prior to the Effective Time, upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained in the Preferred Stock Exchange Documents (as defined in the Merger Agreement), all shares of convertible preferred stock, par value per share, of CGBD CGBD Preferred Stock issued and outstanding will be exchanged for such number of CGBD Common Stock in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act, as is equal to the quotient of (i) the aggregate liquidation preference of Preferred Stock and (ii) the Closing CGBD Net Asset Value per share (the Preferred Stock Exchange ). Any accrued and unpaid dividends of CGBD Preferred Stock thereon to the date of exchange, whether or not declared, will be paid to the holders of record in cash immediately prior to the Preferred Stock Exchange. After the Preferred Stock Exchange and the issuance of the CGBD Common Stock pursuant thereto, each share of CGBD Preferred Stock will cease to be outstanding, will be cancelled, will cease to exist and will thereafter represent only the rights afforded to the common stockholders of CGBD following the closing of the Mergers.

 In accordance with the terms of the Lock-Up Agreement, during the Restricted Period (as defined below), CIM may not transfer (whether by sale, gift, merger, by operation of law or otherwise), assign, pledge or otherwise dispose of or encumber (collectively, a Transfer its shares of CGBD Common Stock resulting from the Preferred Stock Exchange unless the board of directors of CGBD consents to such Transfer and such Transfer is made in accordance with applicable securities and other laws. The Restricted Period will begin on the closing date and end on the date that is (i) days after the closing date for one-third of the shares of CGBD Common Stock issued to CIM as a result of the Preferred Stock Exchange, (ii) days after the closing date for one-third of the shares of CGBD Common Stock issued to CIM as a result of the Preferred Stock Exchange and (iii) days after the closing date for one-third of the shares of CGBD Common Stock issued to CIM as a result of the Preferred Stock Exchange. 
 Consummation of the Mergers, which is expected to occur in the first fiscal quarter of 2025, is subject to certain closing conditions, including requisite approval of CGBD s stockholders and certain other customary closing conditions. Consummation of the Mergers is not subject to approval of the Company s shareholders.

 Carlyle Secured Lending III, a Delaware statutory trust, is a specialty finance company that is a closed-end, externally managed, non-diversified management investment company. We have elected to be regulated as a business development company BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Investment Company Act or the 1940 Act ). For U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a registered investment company RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. We were formed on February 8, 2021 and commenced our operations on May 28, 2021. We conducted our private offering (the Private Offering of Shares to investors in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, Regulation D promulgated thereunder and Regulation S under the Securities Act, and completed our initial closing of capital commitment on February 24, 2022 Initial Closing Date ). We have held additional closings subsequent to the Initial Closing Date, with our final closing occurring on August 24, 2023 (the Final Closing Date ). We commenced our loan origination and investment activities shortly after our initial capital drawdown from our investors in the 
 53 

Private Offering. Our principal executive offices are located at One Vanderbilt Avenue, Suite 3400, New York, New York 10017. 
 Our investment objective is to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation primarily through assembling a portfolio of secured debt investments with favorable risk-adjusted returns. Our investment strategy seeks to extract enhanced yield from a directly originated, and defensively constructed, portfolio of credit investments. The strategy s core focus is U.S. middle market cash flow finance, principally in companies supported by financial sponsors. This core strategy is opportunistically supplemented with differentiated and complementary lending and investing strategies, which take advantage of the broad capabilities of Carlyle s Global Credit platform while offering risk-diversifying portfolio benefits. In describing our business, we use the term middle market to refer generally to companies with approximately 25 million to 100 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ). We seek to achieve our investment objective primarily through a portfolio weighted towards first lien loans or unitranche loans (including last out portions of such loans), while a minority of our portfolio may also include, but not be limited to, assets such as second lien loans, unsecured debt, subordinated debt and select investments in preferred and common equities with loans and structured products that typically have a contractual maturity of six to seven years and typically do not preclude early repayment. 
 We invest primarily in loans to middle market companies whose debt has been rated below investment grade, or would likely be rated below investment grade if it was rated. These securities, which are often referred to as junk, have predominately speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. 
 We are externally managed by our Investment Adviser, an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Investment Company Act and a subsidiary of Carlyle. We benefit from our Investment Adviser s investment team of over 200 investment professionals with the deep knowledge and expertise across multiple asset classes who are supported by a team of finance, operations and administrative professionals currently employed by Carlyle Employee Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of Carlyle. In conducting our investment activities, we believe that we benefit from the significant scale, relationships and resources of Carlyle, including our Investment Adviser and its affiliates. 
 Third Quarter 2024 Highlights 
 Quarterly Results 
 Net investment income was 7.2 million or 0.62 per Share. 
 Dividends declared on Shares were 9.4 million, or 0.80 per Share, inclusive of the base quarterly dividend of 0.60 as well as a supplemental dividend of 0.20. 
 Net investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was aided by a 3.6 million increase in total investment income from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily driven by an increase in the size of our portfolio. 
 The NAV per Share decreased to 20.96 as of September 30, 2024 as compared to 21.28 as of June 30, 2024, primarily due to the supplemental dividend declared exceeding our earnings during the quarter. 
 Portfolio and Investment Activity 
 As of September 30, 2024, we held 108 investments across 81 portfolio companies and 25 industries for a total fair value of 385.6 million. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had investment fundings of 38.5 million and investment repayments of 19.9 million. 
 As of September 30, 2024, non-accrual investments represented 0.0 and 0.0 of our portfolio based on cost and fair value, respectively.

 We had net repayments of 10.4 million on our Credit Facilities. 
 54 

Total liquidity as of September 30, 2024 was 53.5 million in cash and undrawn debt capacity.

 Key Components of Our Results of Operations 
 As a BDC, we believe that the key components of our results of operations for our business are earnings per Share, dividends declared, net investment income and net asset value per Share. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded basic and diluted earnings per Share of 0.48, declared dividends of 0.80 per Share and earned 0.62 of net investment income per Share. 
 The following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per Share (dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data): 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations 5,661 5,555 Weighted-average Shares outstanding 11,685,890 10,901,594 Earnings per Share - Basic and Diluted 0.48 0.51 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, we declared dividends per Share of 0.80 and 0.55, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our NAV per share was 20.96 and 21.07, respectively. 
 Investment Income 
 We generate investment income primarily in the form of interest income on debt investments we hold. In addition, we generate income from dividends on direct equity investments, capital gains on the sales of loans and debt and equity securities and various loan origination and other fees. Our debt investments generally have a stated term of five to eight years and generally bear interest at a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark such as SOFR. Interest on these debt investments is generally paid quarterly. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. At times, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. We may also generate investment income in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. 
 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include: (i) investment advisory fees, including base management fees and incentive fees, to our Investment Adviser pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement; (ii) debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements; (iii) costs and other expenses and our allocable portion of overhead incurred by our Administrator in performing its administrative obligations under the Administration Agreement; and (iv) other operating expenses summarized below:

 Portfolio Credit 
 As part of the monitoring process, our Investment Adviser has developed risk assessment policies pursuant to which it regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our debt investments and rates each of them based on the following categories, which we refer to as Internal Risk Ratings . Key drivers of internal risk ratings include financial metrics, financial covenants, liquidity and enterprise value coverage. Pursuant to these risk policies, an Internal Risk Rating of 1 5, which are defined below, is assigned to each debt investment in our portfolio. 
 59 

Rating Definition 1 Borrower is operating above expectations, and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable. 2 Borrower is operating generally as expected or at an acceptable level of performance. The level of risk to our initial cost basis is similar to the risk to our initial cost basis at the time of origination. This is the initial risk rating assigned to all new borrowers. 3 Borrower is operating below expectations and level of risk to our cost basis has increased since the time of 
 origination. The borrower may be out of compliance with debt covenants. Payments are generally current although there may be higher risk of payment default. 
 4 Borrower is operating materially below expectations and the loan s risk has increased materially since origination. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past due, but generally not by more than 120 days. It is anticipated that we may not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a loss of our initial cost basis upon exit. 5 Borrower is operating substantially below expectations and the loan s risk has increased substantially since origination. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. It is anticipated that we will not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a substantial loss of our initial cost basis upon exit. 
 Our Investment Adviser monitors and, when appropriate, changes the risk ratings assigned to each debt investment in our portfolio. Our Investment Adviser reviews our investment ratings in connection with our quarterly valuation process. The below table summarizes the Internal Risk Ratings as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Consolidated Results of Operations 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 
 The following table sets forth information regarding our consolidated results of operations for the three month periods ending September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively: 
 For the three months ended Change September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 Investment income: Interest income

 Investment Income 
 The increase in investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily driven by an increase in interest income due to a higher average outstanding investment balance. As of September 30, 2024, the size of our portfolio increased to 382,268 from 364,292 as of June 30, 2024, at amortized cost. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the weighted average yield of our total debt and income producing investments was 11.4 and 12.2 , respectively, based on amortized cost. 
 Interest income and PIK income on our first and second lien debt investments are dependent on the composition and credit quality of the portfolio. Generally, we expect the portfolio to generate predictable quarterly interest income based on the terms stated in each loan s credit agreement. As of each of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, there were two investments on non-accrual status at a fair value of 2, which represented approximately 0.0 of total investments at fair value. 
 The increase in other income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from the three months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily driven by higher prepayment fees. 
 62 

Expenses 
 The decrease in interest expense and credit facility fees as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily due to the lower credit facility fee during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The increase in incentive fees was driven by higher pre-incentive fee net investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no accrued capital gains incentive fees based upon the cumulative net realized and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) as of September 30, 2024. The accrual for any capital gains incentive fee under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP in a given period may result in an additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reduction of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no accrual. See Note 4, Related Party Transactions, to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information on the incentive and base management fees. 
 Professional fees include legal, rating agencies, audit, tax, valuation, technology and other professional fees incurred related to the management of the Company. Administrative service fees represent fees paid to the Administrator for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including our allocable portion of the cost of certain of our executive officers and their respective staff. Other general and administrative expenses include insurance, filing, research, subscriptions and other costs. 
 Net Realized Gain (Loss) and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) 
 The amount of and number of investments with realized gain (loss) and change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 were as follows: 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 Realized gains on investments 3 0 Number of investments with realized gains 1 1 Realized losses on investments 0 (1) Number of investments with realized losses 1 2 Change in unrealized appreciation on investments 1,935 840 Number of investments with unrealized appreciation 40 32 Change in unrealized depreciation on investments (2,858) (2,143) Number of investments with unrealized depreciation 42 46 
 Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) is driven by changes in other inputs utilized under our valuation methodology, including, but not limited to, enterprise value multiples, borrower leverage multiples and borrower ratings, and the impact of exits.

As of September 30, 2023, there were no investments on non-accrual status. 
 The increase in other income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by higher amendment and prepayment fees. 
 64 

Expenses 
 The increase in interest expense and credit facility fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by higher weighted average interest rates due to higher benchmark rates and higher weighted outstanding principal balance on Credit Facilities. 
 The increase in incentive fees was driven by higher pre-incentive fee net investment income the for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no accrued capital gains incentive fees based upon the cumulative net realized and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) as of September 30, 2024.

 Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) is driven by changes in other inputs utilized under our valuation methodology, including, but not limited to, enterprise value multiples, borrower leverage multiples and borrower ratings, and the impact of exits. 

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Capitalization 
 We have capitalized our business to date primarily through the issuance and sale of our Shares and asset-level financing. We may also fund a portion of our investments through borrowings under the Credit Facilities, as well as through securitization of a portion of our existing investments. As of September 30, 2024, we had 151,000 of outstanding consolidated indebtedness under the Credit Facilities, as previously discussed within Portfolio and Investment Activity - Portfolio Financing . As of September 30, 2024, we had 53,508 of liquidity that can be used to satisfy our short-term cash requirements and working capital for our business. Refer to Note 6, Borrowings, to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our financing. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, net financial leverage was 0.58x and 0.57x, respectively. 
 65 

Sources of Liquidity 
 Our primary sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our Credit Facilities. 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 18,397 37,131 Available borrowings under Credit Facilities 35,111 35,151 Total Liquidity 53,508 72,282 
 We generate cash from the net proceeds of offerings of our Shares and through cash flows from operations, including investment sales and repayments as well as income earned on investments and cash equivalents. We may also fund a portion of our investments through borrowings under the Credit Facilities, the issuance of debt, and through securitization of a portion of our existing investments. The primary use of existing funds and any funds raised in the future is expected to be for investments in portfolio companies, repayment of indebtedness, cash distributions to our shareholders, repurchases of our Shares and for other general corporate purposes. We believe our current cash position, available capacity on our Credit Facilities, which is well in excess of our unfunded commitments, and net cash provided by operating activities will provide us with sufficient resources to meet our obligations and continue to support our investment objectives, including reserving for the capital needs which may arise at our portfolio companies. 
 Liquidity Needs 
 Our primary liquidity needs include our funding of new and existing portfolio investments, payment of operating expenses and interest and principal payments under the Credit Facilities. 
 Contractual Obligations and Contingencies 
 In the ordinary course of our business, we enter into contracts or agreements that contain indemnifications or warranties. Future events could occur which may give rise to liabilities arising from these provisions against us. We believe that the likelihood of such an event is remote; however, the maximum potential exposure is unknown. No accrual has been made in the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as of September 30, 2024 and our audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023 for any such exposure. 
 We have in the past, currently are and may in the future become obligated to fund commitments such as revolving credit facilities, bridge financing commitments, or delayed draw commitments. We had the following unfunded commitments to fund delayed draw and revolving senior secured loans as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 
 Par / Principal Amount as of September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Unfunded delayed draw commitments 58,100 61,231 Unfunded revolving commitments 18,672 14,443 Total unfunded commitments 76,772 75,674 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table details the net change in our cash and cash equivalents: 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities (47,249) Cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities 28,515 Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (18,734) 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid 113,521 related to cost of investments purchased and received 48,924 in repayments on our investments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net repayments of 1,437 on the Credit Facilities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 1,716,648 Shares for aggregate proceeds of approximately 36,386. 
 66 

Asset Coverage 
 In accordance with the Investment Company Act, a BDC is only allowed to borrow amounts such that its asset coverage, as defined in the Investment Company Act, satisfies the minimum asset coverage ratio specified in the Investment Company Act after such borrowing. Asset coverage generally refers to a company s total assets, less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, as defined in the Investment Company Act, divided by total senior securities representing indebtedness and, if applicable, preferred stock. Senior securities for this purpose includes borrowings from banks or other lenders, debt securities and preferred stock. 
 Prior to March 23, 2018, BDCs were required to maintain a minimum asset coverage ratio of 200 . On March 23, 2018, an amendment to Section 61(a) of the Investment Company Act was signed into law to permit BDCs to reduce the minimum asset coverage ratio from 200 to 150 , so long as certain approval and disclosure requirements are satisfied. Under the 200 minimum asset coverage ratio, BDCs are permitted to borrow up to one dollar for investment purposes for every one dollar of investor equity, and under the 150 minimum asset coverage ratio, BDCs are permitted to borrow up to two dollars for investment purposes for every one dollar of investor equity. In other words, Section 61(a) of the Investment Company Act, as amended, permits BDCs to potentially increase their debt-to-equity ratio from a maximum of 1 to 1 to a maximum of 2 to 1. 
 On June 21, 2021, the Board of Trustees, including a required majority (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the Investment Company Act), and the shareholders of the Company, respectively, approved the application to the Company of the 150 minimum asset coverage ratio set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act, as amended. As a result, the minimum asset coverage ratio applicable to the Company was reduced from 200 to 150 , effective as of June 21, 2021. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had total senior securities of 151,000 and 152,512, respectively, consisting of secured borrowings under the Credit Facilities, and had asset coverage ratios of 262.6 and 233.6 , respectively. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. These estimates and judgments are based on historical information, information currently available to us and on various other assumptions management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could vary from those estimates and we may change our estimates and assumptions in future evaluations. Changes in these estimates and assumptions may have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. There have been no material changes in the critical accounting estimates since those discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in the valuations of our investment portfolio and interest rates. 
 Valuation Risk 
 Our investments generally do not have a readily available market price. Our Investment Adviser, as the valuation designee pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act, values our investments for which market quotations are not readily available in good faith at fair value in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. In addition, because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, these estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and it is possible that the difference could be material. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, on a fair value basis, approximately 99.3 of our debt investments bear interest at a floating rate, which primarily are subject to interest rate floors. The Credit Facilities are subject to floating interest rates and are primarily paid based on floating SOFR rates. 
 67 

Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. There can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our income in the future. 
 The following table estimates the potential changes in net cash flow generated from interest income, should interest rates increase or decrease by 100, 200 or 300 basis points. These hypothetical interest income calculations are based on a model of the settled debt investments in our portfolio, held as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and are only adjusted for assumed changes in the underlying base interest rates and the impact of that change on interest income. Interest expense is calculated based on outstanding secured borrowings as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and based on the terms of our Credit Facilities. Interest expense on our Credit Facilities is calculated using the stated interest rate as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, adjusted for the hypothetical changes in rates, as shown below. We intend to continue to finance a portion of our investments with borrowings and the interest rates paid on our borrowings may significantly impact our net interest income. 
 We regularly measure exposure to interest rate risk. We assess interest rate risk and manage interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities. Based on that review, we determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates. 
 Based on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the following table shows the annual impact on net investment income of base rate changes in interest rates for our settled debt investments (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments) and outstanding secured borrowings assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure:

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our current disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them of material information relating to the Company that is required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act. 
 
 Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 The Company may become party to certain lawsuits in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. The Company is not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against the Company. See also Note 10, Litigation, to the unaudited consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 In addition to the other information set forth within this Form 10-Q, consideration should be given to the information disclosed in Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Risks Relating to the Mergers 
 Because the market price of CGBD Common Stock will fluctuate, our shareholders cannot be sure of the market value of the consideration they will receive in connection with the Mergers until the closing date of the Mergers. 
 At the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time ), each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares owned by CGBD or any of its consolidated subsidiaries, the Cancelled Shares will be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of common stock, par value 0.01 per share, of CGBD CGBD Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (as defined in Note 12, Subsequent Events, to the unaudited consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q), plus any cash (without interest) in lieu of fractional shares. The market value of such consideration to be received by our stockholders upon completion of the Mergers (the Merger Consideration may vary from the closing price of CGBD Common Stock, respectively, on the date the Mergers were announced and on the date the Mergers are completed. Any change in the market price of CGBD Common Stock prior to completion of the Mergers will affect the market value of the Merger Consideration that our shareholders will receive upon completion of the Mergers. If shares of CGBD Common Stock are trading at prices below the net asset value per share as of the Determination Date (as defined in Note 12, Subsequent Events, to the unaudited consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q), the market value of CGBD Common Stock received in the Mergers will be less than the net asset value of the Shares surrendered for exchange. Additionally, the Exchange Ratio will fluctuate as our and CGBD s respective net asset values change prior to the closing date of the Mergers. 
 Accordingly, our shareholders will not know or be able to calculate the market value of the Merger Consideration they would receive upon completion of the Mergers. Neither we nor CGBD is permitted to terminate the Merger Agreement or resolicit the vote of CGBD s stockholders solely because of changes in the market price of shares of CGBD Common Stock. 
 Changes in the market price of CGBD Common Stock may result from a variety of factors, including, among other things: 
 significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of BDCs or other companies in CGBD s sector, which are not necessarily related to the operating performance of these companies; 
 inability to obtain any exemptive relief that may be required by CGBD from the SEC; 
 changes in regulatory policies, accounting pronouncements or tax guidelines, particularly with respect to RICs and BDCs; 
 loss of CGBD s BDC or RIC status; 
 changes in earnings or variations in operating results or distributions that exceed CGBD s net investment income; 
 increases in expenses associated with defense of litigation and responding to SEC inquiries; 
 changes in accounting guidelines governing valuation of CGBD s investments; 
 changes in the value of CGBD s portfolio of investments and any derivative instruments, including as a result of general economic conditions, interest rate shifts and changes in the performance of CGBD s portfolio companies; 
 any shortfall in investment income or net investment income or any increase in losses from levels expected by investors or securities analysts; 
 70 

departure of CGCIM s key personnel; and 
 general economic trends and other external factors. 
 These factors are generally beyond the control of CGBD and may not relate to CGBD s operating performance. The range of high and low closing sales prices per share of CGBD Common Stock as reported on Nasdaq for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was a low of 16.12 and a high of 18.36. However, historical trading prices are not necessarily indicative of future performance. 
 Sales of shares of CGBD Common Stock after the completion of the Mergers may cause the trading price of CGBD Common Stock to decline. 
 Following the completion of the Merger, certain of CGBD stockholders may decide not to hold their shares of CGBD Common Stock. Such sales of CGBD Common Stock could have the effect of depressing the trading price for CGBD Common Stock and may take place promptly following the completion of the Mergers. If this occurs, it could impair CGBD s ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities should CGBD desires to do so. 
 Our shareholders will experience a reduction in percentage ownership and voting power in the combined company as a result of the Mergers. 
 Our shareholders will experience a reduction in their percentage ownership interests and effective voting power in respect of the combined company relative to their percentage ownership interests in us prior to the Mergers. Consequently, our shareholders should expect to exercise less influence over the management and policies of the combined company following the Mergers than they currently exercise over our management and policies. In addition, prior to completion of the Mergers, subject to certain restrictions in the Merger Agreement, we and CGBD may issue additional shares of Shares and CGBD Common Stock, respectively, which would further reduce the percentage ownership of the combined company to be held by the current shareholders. 
 After completion of the Mergers, CGBD may issue additional shares of CGBD Common Stock at prices below CGBD Common Stock s then-current NAV per share, subject to certain restrictions under the Investment Company Act, including stockholder approval of such issuance. The issuance or sale by CGBD of shares of CGBD Common Stock at a discount to NAV poses a risk of dilution to stockholders. 
 CGBD may be unable to realize the benefits anticipated by the Mergers, including estimated cost savings, or it may take longer than anticipated to achieve such benefits. 
 The realization of certain benefits anticipated as a result of the Mergers will depend in part on the integration of our investment portfolio with CGBD s investment portfolio and the integration of our business with CGBD s business. There can be no assurance that our investment portfolio or business can be operated profitably going forward or integrated successfully into CGBD s operations in a timely fashion or at all. The dedication of management resources to such integration may detract attention from the day-to-day business of the combined company and there can be no assurance that there will not be substantial costs associated with the transition process or there will not be other material adverse effects as a result of these integration efforts. Such effects, including incurring unexpected costs or delays in connection with such integration and failure of our investment portfolio to perform as expected, could have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the combined company. 
 CGBD also expects to achieve certain synergies and cost savings from the Mergers when the two companies have fully integrated their portfolios. It is possible that the estimates of these synergies and potential cost savings could ultimately be incorrect. The cost savings estimates also assume CGBD will be able to combine our operations and CGBD s operations in a manner that permits those cost savings to be fully realized. If the estimates turn out to be incorrect or if CGBD is not able to successfully combine our investment portfolio or business with CGBD s operations, the anticipated synergies and cost savings may not be fully realized or realized at all or may take longer to realize than expected. 
 If the Mergers do not close, we will not benefit from the expenses incurred in pursuit of the Mergers. 
 The Mergers may not be completed. If the Mergers are not completed, we will have incurred substantial expenses for which no ultimate benefit will have been received. We have incurred out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the Mergers for investment banking, legal and accounting fees and financial printing and other related charges, much of which will be incurred even if the Mergers are not completed. 
 71 

The termination of the Merger Agreement could negatively impact us. 
 If the Merger Agreement is terminated, there may be various consequences, including: 
 our business may have been adversely impacted by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the Mergers, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the Mergers; 
 we may not be able to find a party willing to pay an equivalent or more attractive price than the price CGBD agreed to pay in the Mergers; 
 our business may have experienced negative reactions from the investment community, employees, or other partners in the business community; and 
 we may have been required to pay certain costs relating to the Mergers, whether or not the Mergers are completed. 
 The Merger Agreement limits our ability to pursue alternatives to the Mergers. 
 The Merger Agreement contains provisions that limit our ability to discuss, facilitate or commit to competing third party proposals to acquire all or a significant part of us, which are typical for transactions of this type. 
 The Mergers are subject to closing conditions, including CGBD stockholder approval, that, if not satisfied or (to the extent legally allowed) waived, will result in the Mergers not being completed, which may result in material adverse consequences to our business and operations. Consummation of the Mergers is not subject to approval of our shareholders. 
 The completion of the Mergers remains subject to the satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions, including among others (1) requisite approval of CGBD s stockholders, (2) authorization of the shares of CGBD Common Stock to be issued as consideration in the Mergers for listing on Nasdaq, (3) effectiveness of the registration statement for CGBD Common Stock to be issued as consideration in the Mergers, (4) the absence of certain legal impediments to the consummation of the Mergers, (5) determinations of closing NAV in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, (6) consummation of the Preferred Stock Exchange in accordance with the Preferred Stock Exchange Documents, (7) execution of the Lock-Up Agreement by CGBD and CIM, to be effective as of the closing of the Mergers, and (8) subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties and compliance with the covenants of each party to the Merger Agreement. Consummation of the Mergers is not subject to approval of our shareholders. 
 The closing condition that CGBD s stockholders approve the issuance of shares of CGBD Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement may not be waived and must be satisfied for the Mergers to be completed. If CGBD s stockholders do not approve the issuance of shares of CGBD Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement and the Mergers are not completed, the resulting failure of the Mergers could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations. In addition to the required approvals of CGBD s stockholders, the Mergers are subject to a number of other conditions beyond our control that may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect completion of the Mergers. We cannot predict whether and when these other conditions will be satisfied. 
 We will be subject to operational uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Mergers are pending. 
 Uncertainty about the effect of the Mergers may have an adverse effect on us and, consequently, on the combined company following completion of the Mergers. 
 These uncertainties may cause those that deal with us to seek to change their existing business relationships with us. In addition, the Merger Agreement restricts us from taking actions that we might otherwise consider to be in our best interests. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Mergers. 
 The market price of CGBD Common Stock after the Mergers may be affected by factors different from those affecting CGBD Common Stock currently. 
 Our business and CGBD s business differ in some respects and, accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company and the market price of CGBD Common Stock after the Mergers may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the independent results of operations, such as a larger stockholder base and a different capital structure. Accordingly, CGBD s historical trading prices and financial results may not be indicative of these matters for the combined company following the Mergers. 
 72 

If we have not consummated Liquidity Event, including the Mergers, by the end of the Company s drawdown period, our Board of Trustees (to the extent consistent with its fiduciary duties and subject to any necessary shareholder approvals and applicable requirements of the Investment Company Act) will meet to consider our potential wind down and/or liquidation and dissolution. 
 If we have not consummated a Liquidity Event, including the Mergers, by the end of the Company s drawdown period, our Board of Trustees (to the extent consistent with its fiduciary duties and subject to any necessary shareholder approvals and applicable requirements of the Investment Company Act) will meet to consider our potential wind down and/or liquidation and dissolution. To the extent our Board of Trustees determines to pursue a liquidation or dissolution, no assurances can be provided as to what price they will be able to obtain from selling or liquidating our investments and we could end up being liquidated below our then NAV per share or at a price per share below what shareholders paid. 
 In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs, our common shareholders would receive any remaining net assets only after payment or provision or payment of our debts and other liabilities and subject to the prior rights of any outstanding preferred stock. In addition, we expect that we would incur certain costs associated with a liquidation or dissolution. Accordingly, to the extent our Board of Trustees determines to proceed with our liquidation or dissolution, it could result in a loss for our common shareholders. 
 Litigation against the Company, CGBD, or the members of our Board of Trustees and CGBD s board of directors, could prevent or delay the completion of the Mergers or result in the payment of damages following completion of the Mergers. 
 It is possible that lawsuits may be filed by our shareholders or CGBD s stockholders challenging the Mergers. The outcome of such lawsuits cannot be assured, including the amount of costs associated with defending these claims or any other liabilities that may be incurred in connection with the litigation of these claims. If plaintiffs are successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the parties from completing the Mergers, such injunction may delay the consummation of the Mergers in the expected timeframe, or may prevent the Mergers from being consummated at all. Whether or not any plaintiff s claim is successful, this type of litigation can result in significant costs and divert management s attention and resources from the closing of the Mergers and ongoing business activities, which could adversely affect the operations of the Company. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Except as previously reported by the Company on a Current Report on Form 8-K, we did not sell any equity securities during the period covered in this report that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 
 
 Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 
 Not applicable. 
 
 Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 
 Not applicable. 
 
 Item 5. Other Information 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director, trustee or Section 16 officer of the Company or any Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements (in each case, as defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K).
