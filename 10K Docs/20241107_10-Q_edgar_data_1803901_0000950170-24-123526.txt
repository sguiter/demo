Total revenue 

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses The Co mpany had receivables related to revenue from DTE customers of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the balance of receivables related to revenue from Payor customers was million and million, respectively. Accounts receivables are stated net of credit losses allowance. The Company s methodology for estimating credit loss is based on historical collection experience, customer creditworthiness, current and future economic condition and market condition. Additionally, specific allowance amounts are established to record the appropriate provision for customers that have a higher probability of default. Accounts receivables are written off after all reasonable means to collect the full amount have been exhausted. Credit losses were immaterial for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Deferred Revenue The Company records deferred revenues when cash payments from customers are received in advance of the Company's performance obligation to provide services. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, deferred revenue related mainly to Consumer subscriptions. The Company expects to satisfy the majority of its performance obligations associated with deferred revenue within one year or less. Revenue recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 that was included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of each reporting period was million and million, respectively, and immaterial for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

TPN and the PC entities are considered VIEs. Under the provisions of ASC 810, Consolidation, an entity consolidates a VIE if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary has both (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance, and (b) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company has determined that it is able to direct the activities of TPN and the PC entities that most significantly impact their economic performance and it funds and absorbs all losses of these VIEs resulting in the Company being the primary beneficiary of these entities. Accordingly, the Company consolidates these VIEs.

 Item 2 . Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this section as to Talkspace, the Company, we, us or our refer to the business of Talkspace, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes contained in this Quarterly Report and the financial statements and related notes contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those discussed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and Forward-Looking Statements sections and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. 
 
 The purpose of this section is to discuss and analyze our consolidated financial condition, liquidity and capital resources and results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Overview 
 Talkspace is a healthcare company offering its members convenient and affordable access to a fully-credentialed network of highly qualified providers. We are a leading virtual behavioral health company connecting millions of patients with licensed mental health providers across a wide and growing spectrum of care through virtual counseling, psychotherapy and psychiatry. We created a purpose-built platform to address the vast, unmet and growing demand for mental health services of our members. Through its platform, Talkspace serves: 
 Health insurance plans and employee assistance programs Payor such as Aetna, Cigna, and Optum, who offer their insured members access to our platform at in-network reimbursement rates, 

Direct-to-Enterprise customers DTE comprised of enterprises such as Google, the University of Kentucky and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, who offer their enterprise members access to our platform while their enterprise is under an active contract with Talkspace, and 

Individual subscribers Consumer who subscribe directly to our platform. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 158.1 million eligible lives compared to 112.9 million eligible lives as of September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had over 8,600 Consumer active members compared to 13,300 Consumer active members as of September 30, 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our clinicians completed 316,400 and 899,200 sessions, respectively, related to members covered under our Payor customers, compared to 228,600 and 600,800 completed sessions, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Please refer to the Key Business Metrics section below for a description of eligible lives and Consumer active members. 
 Inflation Risk and Economic Conditions 
 The demand for our solution is dependent on the general economy, which is in turn affected by geopolitical conditions, the stability of the global credit markets, inflationary pressures, higher interest rates, the industries in which our Payor and DTE customers operate or serve, and other factors. Downturns in the general economy could disproportionately affect the demand for our solution and cause it to decrease. 
 Our operations could also be impacted by inflation and higher interest rates. Inflation did not have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. However, if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures (such as Provider cost), we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases or cost savings. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Operating Segments 
 The Company operates as a single segment, which is how the chief operating decision maker CODM ), who is the Chief Executive Officer, reviews financial performance and allocates resources.

 Key Business Metrics 
 We monitor the following key metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions. We believe the following metrics are useful in evaluating our business:

Eligible Lives: We consider eligible lives eligible if such persons are eligible to receive treatment on the Talkspace platform, in the case of our Payor customers, at an agreed upon reimbursement rate through insurance under an employee assistance program or other network behavioral health paid benefit program. There may be instances where a person may be covered through multiple solutions, typically through behavioral health plans and employee assistance programs. In these instances, the person is counted each time they are covered in the eligible lives calculation, which may cause this amount to reflect a higher number of eligible lives than we actually serve. 
 
 Active Members: We consider consumer members active commencing on the date such member initiates contact with a provider on our platform until the term of their monthly, quarterly or bi-annual subscription plan expires, unless terminated early. 
 
 Unique Payor Active Members: Represents unique users who had a session completed during the period. 
 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenues from services provided to individuals who are qualified to receive access to the Company's services through our commercial arrangements with health insurance plans, employee assistance organizations and enterprises. We also generate revenues from the sale of monthly, quarterly, bi-annual and annual membership subscriptions to the Company's therapy platform as well as supplementary a la carte offerings directly to individual consumers through a subscription plan. See Note 3, Revenue Recognition in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further details. 
 Revenue growth is generated from a combination of increasing our eligible covered lives through contracting with health insurance plans and employee assistance organizations, increasing utilization within eligible covered lives, expanding enterprise customers, and increasing membership subscriptions. 
 Cost of Revenues 
 Cost of revenues is comprised primarily of therapist payments. Cost of revenues is largely driven by number of sessions and the size of our provider network that is required to service the growth of our health plan and enterprise customers, in addition to the growth of our customer base. 
 We designed our business model and our provider network to be scalable and to leverage a hybrid model of both employee providers and independently contracted providers to support multiple growth scenarios. The compensation paid to our independently contracted providers is variable, and the amount paid to a provider is generally based on the amount of time committed by such provider to our members. Our employee providers receive a fixed-salary and discretionary bonuses, where applicable, all of which is included in cost of revenues.

Table of Contents 

 While we expect to make increased investments to support accelerated growth and the required investment to scale our provider network, we also expect increased efficiencies and economies of scale. Our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues is expected to fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of these factors as well as pricing fluctuations.

 Revenues 
 Revenues increased by 8.8 million, or 22.6 to 47.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 38.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was principally due to a 44.9 increase in Payor revenue driven by a higher number of completed Payor sessions, and a 17.1 growth in DTE revenue, partially offset by a 29.8 decline in Consumer revenue. Revenue from our Payor customers increased by 9.9 million, or 44.9 , to 32.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 22.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue from our DTE customers increased by 1.4 million, or 17.1 to 9.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 8.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Consumer revenue decreased by 2.5 million, or 29.8 , to 6.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 8.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to the Company's intentional and strategic decision to optimize and focus marketing efforts on attracting Payor members. While we no longer have marketing resources dedicated solely to the Consumer category, it continues to have a positive contribution to our financial results. 
 Revenues increased by 31.2 million, or 29.0 to 138.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 107.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was principally due to a 63.2 increase in Payor revenue driven by a higher number of completed Payor sessions, and a 17.0 growth in DTE revenue, partially offset by a 29.1 decline in Consumer revenue. Revenue from our Payor customers increased by 35.0 million, or 63.2 , to 90.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 55.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue from our DTE customers increased by 4.2 million, or 17.0 to 28.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 24.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Consumer revenue decreased by 8.0 million, or 29.1 , to 19.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 27.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to the Company's intentional and strategic decision to optimize and focus marketing efforts on attracting Payor members. While we no longer have marketing resources dedicated solely to the Consumer category, it continues to have a positive contribution to our financial results. 
 Costs of revenues 
 Cost of revenues increased by 6.0 million, or 30.2 , to 25.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 19.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and increased by 20.4 million, or 37.5 , to 74.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 54.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 18 

Table of Contents 

 The increase in cost of revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to increased hours worked by therapists as a result of increased Payor sessions. 
 Gross profit 
 Gross profit increased by 2.8 million, or 14.7 , to 21.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 18.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and increased by 10.9 million, or 20.4 , to 64.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 53.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in gross profit was primarily driven by an increase in the Company's revenues partially offset by an increase in cost of revenues to service more members and sessions. 
 Gross margin was 45.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 48.8 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin was 46.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 49.6 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decline in gross margin was driven by a shift in revenue mix towards Payor as Consumer sessions tend to provide higher margins. 
 Operating expenses 
 Overall, operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 have decreased by 2.5 million or 10.4 to 21.5 million from 24.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 have decreased by 4.7 million or 6.3 to 69.4 million from 74.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to our efforts to achieve greater operational efficiency. 
 Research and development expenses. Research and development expenses decreased by 1.8 million, or 43.7 to 2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and decreased by 5.5 million, or 39.8 to 8.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 13.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in research and development expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in employee-related costs, inclusive of non-cash stock compensation expense, as a result of the exclusion of amounts reflected as capitalized internal-use software development costs. Capitalized internal-use software development costs were 1.9 million and 4.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Clinical operations expenses. Clinical operations expenses increased by 0.3 million, or 19.4 to 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and increased by 0.1 million, or 2.6 to 4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in clinical operations expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs, inclusive of non-cash stock compensation expense. 
 Sales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 0.8 million, or 6.4 , to 12.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 13.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and decreased by 1.1 million, or 2.7 , to 38.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 39.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by a decrease in employee-related costs, inclusive of non-cash stock compensation expense and a decrease in third-party subcontractor costs, partially offset by an increase in direct marketing and promotional costs. 
 General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased by 0.1 million, or 2.0 , to 5.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and increased by 1.7 million, or 10.9 , to 17.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 16.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in severance costs, professional fees and recruitment costs, partially offset by a decrease in third-party subcontractor costs. 
 Financial (income), net 
 Financial (income), net was 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.8 million three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Taxes on income 
 Taxes on income consists primarily of foreign income taxes related to income generated by our subsidiary organized under the laws of Israel. Taxes on income were immaterial for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to our financial results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, is useful in evaluating our operating performance, and our management uses it as a key performance measure to assess our operating performance. Because adjusted EBITDA facilitates internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis, we use this measure for business planning purposes and in evaluating acquisition opportunities. We also use adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our business, results of operations or outlook. We believe that the use of adjusted EBITDA is helpful to our investors as it is a metric used by management in assessing the health of our business and our operating performance. However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. 
 Some of the limitations of adjusted EBITDA include (i) adjusted EBITDA does not necessarily reflect capital commitments to be paid in the future and (ii) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the underlying assets may need to be replaced and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect these requirements. In evaluating adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses similar to the adjustments described herein. Our presentation of adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by these expenses or any unusual or non-recurring items. Our adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because they may not calculate adjusted EBITDA in the same manner as we calculate the measure, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to income (loss) before income taxes, net income (loss), income (loss) per share, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. When evaluating our performance, you should consider adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including our net income (loss) and other GAAP results. 
 A reconciliation is provided below for adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. We do not provide a forward-looking reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA guidance as the amount and significance of the reconciling items required to develop meaningful comparable GAAP financial measures cannot be estimated at this time without unreasonable efforts. These reconciling items could be meaningful. 
 We calculate adjusted EBITDA as net loss income adjusted to exclude (i) depreciation and amortization, (ii) interest and other expenses (income), net, (iii) tax benefit and expense, and (iv) stock-based compensation expense.

(1) For the three months ended September 30, 2024, financial (income), net, primarily consisted of 1.5 million of interest income from our money market accounts and 0.3 million in non-cash gains resulting from the remeasurement of warrant liabilities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, financial (income), net, primarily consisted of 4.6 million of interest income from our money market accounts and 0.8 million in non-cash gains resulting from the remeasurement of warrant liabilities. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, financial (income), net, primarily consisted of 1.6 million of interest income from our money market accounts, partially offset by 0.8 million in non-cash losses resulting from the remeasurement of warrant liabilities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, financial (income), net, primarily consisted of 3.7 million of interest income from our money market accounts, partially offset by 0.6 million in non-cash losses resulting from the remeasurement of warrant liabilities. 

(2) For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, non-recurring expenses primarily consisted of severance costs related to the departure of key executives of the Company and other related costs. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, non- recurring expenses primarily consisted in losses resulting from the disposition of fixed assets. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 119.0 million of cash and cash equivalents 123.9 million as of December 31, 2023), which we use to finance our operations and support a variety of growth initiatives and investments. We had no debt as of September 30, 2024. 
 Our primary cash needs are to fund operating activities and invest in technology development. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, contract renewal activity, the timing and extent of investments to support product development efforts, our expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced service offerings, and the continuing market acceptance of virtual behavioral services. Additionally, we may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies. 
 We currently anticipate to be able to fund our cash needs for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future using available cash and cash equivalent balances as of September 30, 2024. However, in the future we may require additional capital to respond to technological advancements, competitive dynamics, customer demands, business and investment opportunities, acquisitions or unforeseen circumstances and we may determine to engage in equity or debt financings for other reasons. We may not be able to timely secure additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt or other equity-linked securities, our existing stockholders could experience significant dilution. Any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. If we cannot raise capital when needed, we may be forced to undertake asset sales or similar measures to ensure adequate liquidity. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 On February 22, 2024, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program to authorize the repurchase of up to 15.0 million of the currently outstanding shares of the Company s common stock over a period of twenty-four months beginning on March 1, 2024 (the Share Repurchase Program ). On August 1, 2024, the Company s Board of Directors amended the Share Repurchase Program to authorize the Company to repurchase up to an additional 25.0 million of its common stock. The Share Repurchase Program will remain in effect until the total authorized dollar amount of shares is repurchased or August 1, 2026.

Table of Contents 

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company purchased and canceled an aggregate of 2,948,892 shares of its common stock for a total consideration of 8.0 million 2.71 per share) under the Share Repurchase Program. As of September 30, 2024, a total of 32.0 million remained available for share repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program. 
 Such repurchases may be completed periodically through various methods in compliance with applicable state and federal securities laws and will be at times and in amounts as the Company deems appropriate, based on factors such as price, market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, constraints specified in any Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, alternative investment opportunities and other business considerations. All shares repurchased will be canceled. The program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares, and may be suspended or terminated at any time.

Operating Activities 
 The decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily driven by a lower net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Investing Activities 
 The increase in net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by an increase in capitalized internal-use software development costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023. 
 Financing Activities 
 The increase in net cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by the purchase of 8.0 million of outstanding shares of the Company s common stock under the Share Repurchase Program and an increase in taxes paid related to vested stock-based awards during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023. 
 Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies 
 As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any short-term or long-term debt, or significant long-term liabilities. As of September 30, 2024, we have a non-material long-term operating lease for our office space in New York, NY. 
 We may in the future be involved in various legal proceedings, claims and litigation that arise in the normal course of business. We accrue for estimated loss contingencies related to legal matters when available information indicates that it is probable a liability has been incurred and we can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss. In many proceedings, however, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible or to estimate the amount of any loss. In addition, even where a loss is possible or an exposure to loss exists in excess of the liability already accrued with respect to a previously recognized loss contingency, it is often not possible to reasonably estimate the size of the possible loss or range of loss or possible additional losses or range of additional losses. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. As of September 30, 2024 there were no material legal proceedings, claims or litigation.

Table of Contents 

 Our commercial contract arrangements generally include certain provisions requiring us to indemnify customers against liabilities if there is a breach of a customer s data or if our service infringes a third party s intellectual property rights. To date, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications. 
 We have also agreed to indemnify our officers and directors for costs associated with any fees, expenses, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any of these persons in any action or proceeding to which any of those persons is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the person s service as a director or officer, including any action by us, arising out of that person s services as our director or officer or that person s services provided to any other company or enterprise at our request. We maintain director and officer liability insurance coverage that would generally enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We may also be subject to indemnification obligations by law with respect to the actions of our employees under certain circumstances and in certain jurisdictions. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We do not invest in any off-balance sheet vehicles that provide liquidity, capital resources, market or credit risk support, or engage in any activities that expose us to any liability that is not reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements.

Certain of those policies are considered to be particularly important to the presentation of the Company's financial results because they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, often as a result of matters that are inherently uncertain. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to matters discussed under the heading Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Part II, Item 7 of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 Information regarding recent accounting developments and their impact on our results can be found in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates in the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report may be forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as may, will, should, expects, plans, anticipates, could, intends, targets, projects, contemplates, believes, estimates, forecasts, predicts, potential or continue or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. Forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, industry and business trends, stock-based compensation, revenue recognition, business strategy, plans and market growth. 
 
 The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report and other such statements we publicly make from time-to-time are only predictions. We base these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Many important factors could cause actual future events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this press release, including but not limited to: (i) our business and the markets we operate in are rapidly evolving; (ii) rapid technological change in our industry; (iii) our ability to secure clients' contract renewals; (iv) our ability to maintain and expand our network of therapists, psychiatrists and other providers; (v) a decline in the prevalence of enterprise-sponsored healthcare or the emergence of new technologies may adversely impact our DTE business; (vi) if our or our vendors security measures fail or are breached; (vii) changes in healthcare laws, regulations or trends and our ability to operate in the heavily regulated healthcare industry; and (viii) and the other factors, risks and uncertainties discussed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, including this report. The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report are based upon information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain, and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements. 
 
 You should read this Quarterly Report and the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 with the understanding that our actual future results, levels of activity, performance and achievements may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or any forward-looking statements we may publicly make from time-to-time, whether as a result of any new information, future events or otherwise.

 Item 3 . Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to the information contained in Part II, Item 7A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Item 4 . Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 Based on their evaluation as of September 30, 2024, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the United States Securities and Exchange Commission s SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes that materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
