OVERVIEW Monarch was incorporated in the state of Nevada in 1993. We own and operate the Atlantis Casino Resort Spa, a hotel and casino in Reno, Nevada (the Atlantis and Monarch Casino Resort Spa Black Hawk (the Monarch Black Hawk ), a casino in Black Hawk, Colorado. In addition, we own separate parcels of land located next to the Atlantis and a parcel of land with an industrial warehouse located between Denver, Colorado and Monarch Black Hawk.

Table of Contents 
 We earn revenues, operating income and cash flow from Atlantis and Monarch Black Hawk, primarily through our casino, food and beverage, and hotel operations. We focus on delivering exceptional service and value to our guests. Our hands-on management style focuses on customer services and cost efficiencies. Atlantis: We continuously upgrade our property. With quality gaming, hotel and dining products, we believe the Atlantis is well positioned to benefit from future macro and local economic growth. Reno remains a healthy local-oriented market, but at the same time a very competitive market. The market s employment growth is broad based and we expect this positive indicator will support the continued strength of our business at Atlantis. At the same time, the tight employment environment has created labor challenges, including wage inflation, which we continue to actively manage. In addition, we are facing increased competition from the continued growth of California tribal gaming and an extremely competitive promotional environment in Northern Nevada. The increase in the labor costs and the other inflationary pressures, combined with continued aggressive marketing programs by our competitors, has applied pressure on Atlantis revenue growth, operating costs and profit margins. Monarch Black Hawk: Monarch Black Hawk is the first property encountered by visitors arriving from Denver and other major population centers via Colorado State Highway 119. The Denver metro economy remains strong with higher than the national average per capita personal income. At the beginning of 2022, we completed the master planned renovation and expansion, transforming the property into a world-class resort. Monarch Black Hawk is positioned to leverage the expanded operation, the elimination of betting limits and new game types in Black Hawk, Colorado, as well as to benefit from the growing state-wide online and retail sports betting. Monarch Black Hawk also is experiencing labor challenges, resulting from the distance to the staffing filter markets of Golden, Colorado and the Denver Metro area. We continue to attract high-value players from across Colorado s Front Range, who had previously traveled to other markets, such as Las Vegas, for a high-end casino entertainment experience. We believe that the quality of our expanded product and exceptional guest service will meet the demand of the high-end segment of the market and will grow revenue and accelerate market share. KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS We use the following Key Performance Indicators KPI to manage our operation and measure our performance: Gaming revenue KPI: Our management reviews on a consistent basis the volume metrics and hold percentage metrics for each gaming area. The main volume measurements are slot coin-in, table games drop, sportsbook write and keno write. Slot coin-in represents the dollar amount wagered in slot machines, including free promotional wagers. Table games drop represents the total amount of cash and net markers deposited in the table drop box. Keno write and sportsbook write represents the dollar amount wagered at our counters, along with sportsbook write made through our mobile wagering system. Volume metrics are important in managing the business, as our gaming win is affected by actual hold percentage, which in general varies from the expected hold percentage and historical hold percentage. Gaming win represents the amount of wagers retained by us. Hold percentage represents win as a percentage of slot coin-in, table game drop, sportsbook write, or keno write. Our win and hold percentages are calculated before discounts, commissions, deferring revenue associated with our loyalty programs and allocating casino revenues related to goods and services provided to patrons on a complimentary basis. Food and Beverage revenue KPI: The main KPIs in managing our food and beverage F B operations are covers and average revenue per cover. A cover represents the number of guests served and is an indicator of volume. Average revenue per cover represents the average amount spent per food and beverage outlets served guests. Changes in the average revenue per cover might be an indicator for changes in menu offerings, changes in menu prices or may indicate changes in our guests preferences and purchasing habits.

Table of Contents 
 Hotel revenue KPI: The main KPIs used in managing our hotel operation are the occupancy rate (a volume indicator), which is the average percentage of available hotel rooms occupied during a period, and the average daily rate ADR , a price indicator), which is the average price per sold room. Available rooms exclude those rooms unavailable for occupancy during the period due to renovation, development, or other requirements. Sold rooms include rooms where the guests do not show up for their stay and lose their deposit. The calculations of the occupancy rate and ADR include the impact of rooms provided on a complimentary basis. Revenue per available room ("RevPAR") represents total hotel revenue per available room and is a representation of the occupancy rate, ADR and miscellaneous hotel sales. Operating margins: Our management is consistently focused on controlling expenses and finding cost savings, without affecting the quality of the product we offer and our guests services and experience. We measure our performance using expense margin, which is a percentage of direct expenses, including labor, cost of product and any other operating expenses related to the gaming, food and beverage, or hotel operation to the net gaming, food and beverage, or hotel revenues. Selling, general and administrative SG A margin represents SG A expenses for a period as a percentage of total net revenue for a period. In managing the food and beverage operation, we use Cost Of Goods Sold COGS percentage, which represents a percentage of product cost to the food and beverage revenue and is a measurement of commodity prices and menu sales prices. Our management evaluates the KPI as compared to prior periods, the peer group, or market, as well as for any trends.

Casino operating expense as a percentage of casino revenue increased to 36.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 34.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in labor expense and slots participation expense. Food and beverage revenue for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 0.2 compared to the third quarter of 2023 due to 2.4 decrease in covers. Food and beverage revenue per cover increased 2.2 .

See further discussion of our Amended Credit Facility in the LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES section below. CAPITAL SPENDING AND DEVELOPMENT We seek to continually upgrade and maintain our facilities in order to present a fresh, high quality product to our guests. Cash paid for capital expenditures for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled 34.4 million and 34.6 million, respectively. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, our capital expenditures related primarily to the redesign and upgrade of hotel rooms in the third tower at Atlantis, and the acquisition of gaming, and other equipment to upgrade and replace existing equipment at Atlantis and Monarch Black Hawk. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 our capital expenditures related primarily to the redesign and upgrade of hotel rooms in the second tower at Atlantis, re-carpeting the casino floor at Atlantis and the acquisition of gaming, and other equipment to upgrade and replace existing equipment at Atlantis and Monarch Black Hawk. Capital expenditures during each of the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 were funded from operating cash flows and borrowings against the Company s credit facility. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations and, for capital expansion projects, borrowings available under our Amended Credit Facility. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities totaled 102.9 million, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 134.4 million in the same prior year period. This decrease was primarily a result of the decrease in income tax receivable as a result of receipt of an income tax refund in the third quarter of 2023 and change in working capital, offset by an increase in depreciation expense, net income, and stock options expense. Net cash used in investing activities totaled 34.4 million and 34.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities during the first nine months of 2024 consisted primarily of cash used for the redesign and upgrade of hotel rooms in the third tower at Atlantis and the acquisition of gaming and other equipment at both properties. Net cash used in investing activities during the first nine months of 2023 consisted primarily of cash used for the redesign and upgrade of hotel rooms in the second tower at Atlantis, re-carpeting the casino floor at Atlantis, and the acquisition of gaming and other equipment at both properties. Net cash used in financing activities in the first nine months of 2024 totaled 72.5 million and consisted of 60.0 million cash used for purchase of Company stock under the Repurchase Plan and 16.7 million used for payment of dividends, partially offset by 2.7 million of net proceeds from stock options exercise and 1.5 million of borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility, net of the payments to the lender under the Amended Credit Facility. Net cash used in financing activities in the first nine months of 2023 totaled 104.6 million and consisted of 107.0 million used for payment of dividends, offset by 1.3 million of net proceeds from stock options exercise and 1.0 million of borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility, net of the payments to the lender under the Amended Credit Facility. Amended Credit Facility On February 1, 2023, the Company entered into the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Amended Credit Facility with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. The Amended Credit Facility provides for a 100 million line of credit which matures on January 1, 2025.

 As of September 30, 2024, we had an outstanding principal balance of 7.0 million under the Amended Credit Facility. In addition to other customary covenants for a facility of this nature, as of September 30, 2024, we were required to maintain a Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility) of no more than 2.5:1 and Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility) of at least 1.1:1. As of September 30, 2024, our Total Leverage Ratio and Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio were 0.04:1 and 109.52:1, respectively. The interest rate under the Amended Credit Facility is SOFR (the Secured Overnight Financing Rate) plus a margin ranging from 1.00 to 1.50 , or a base rate (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility) plus a margin ranging from 0.00 to 0.50 . The applicable margins will vary depending on the Company s leverage ratio. In addition, SOFR-based loans will incur a 0.10 credit adjustment spread due to the conversion from LIBOR to SOFR as the new benchmark rate. As of September 30, 2024, the interest rate was 6.2 , or SOFR plus a 1.00 margin. The Company s obligations under the Amended Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of the Company s assets. We believe that our anticipated operating cash flows will be sufficient to sustain operations for the twelve months from the filing of this Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and fulfill our capital expenditure plans and authorized dividend distributions. However financial, economic, competitive, regulatory, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, could negatively impact our operations. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow in the upcoming months or if our cash needs exceed our borrowing capacity under the Amended Credit Facility, we could be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing, delaying or eliminating planned capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring debt or issuing additional equity. For a discussion regarding our material commitments for capital expenditures, see the CAPITAL SPENDING AND DEVELOPMENT section above. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES A description of our critical accounting policies and estimates can be found in Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2023 Form 10-K. For a more extensive discussion of our accounting policies, see Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Our current primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk relating to the impact of interest rate movements under our Amended Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, we had 7.0 million of outstanding balance under our Amended Credit Facility. A hypothetical 1 increase in the interest rate on the balance outstanding under the Amended Credit Facility at September 30, 2024, would have resulted in a change in our annual interest cost of approximately 0.1 million. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for further discussion of our Amended Credit Facility and capital structure. We have not entered into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We do not have any cash or cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 that are subject to market risk.
