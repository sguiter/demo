 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
 
 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Business Overview 
 LPL serves the advisor-mediated marketplace as the nation s largest independent broker-dealer, a leading investment advisory firm and a top custodian. We serve more than 23,000 financial advisors, including advisors at approximately 1,000 institutions and at approximately 580 registered investment advisor RIA firms nationwide, providing the front-, middle- and back-office support our advisors need. Through our comprehensive platform, we offer integrated technology solutions; brokerage and advisory platforms; clearing, compliance, business and planning and advice services; consultative practice management programs and training; and in-house research to help our advisors deliver advice to their clients and run successful businesses. 
 We are steadfast in our commitment to the advisor-mediated model and the belief that investors deserve access to personalized guidance from a financial advisor. We believe advisors should have the freedom to choose the business model, services and technology they need and to manage their client relationships. We believe investors achieve better outcomes when working with a financial advisor, and we strive to make it easy for advisors to do what is best for their clients. 
 We believe that we are the only company that offers the unique combination of an integrated technology platform, comprehensive self-clearing services and access to a wide range of curated non-proprietary products all delivered in an environment unencumbered by conflicts from product manufacturing, underwriting and market-making. 
 
 Our Sources of Revenue 
 Our revenue is derived primarily from fees and commissions from products and advisory services offered by our advisors to their clients, a substantial portion of which we pay out to our advisors, as well as fees we receive from our advisors for the use of our technology, custody, clearing, trust and reporting platforms. We also generate asset-based revenue through our insured bank sweep vehicles, money market account balances and the access we provide to a variety of product providers with the following product lines: 
 Alternative Investments 
 Retirement Plan Products 
 Annuities 
 Separately Managed Accounts 
 Exchange Traded Products 
 Structured Products 
 Insurance Based Products 
 Unit Investment Trusts 
 Mutual Funds 
 
 Under our self-clearing platform, we custody the majority of client assets invested in these financial products, for which we provide statements, transaction processing and ongoing account management. In return for these services, mutual funds, insurance companies, banks and other financial product sponsors pay us fees based on asset levels or number of accounts managed. We also earn interest from margin loans made to our advisors clients, cash and equivalents segregated under federal or other regulations, advisor repayable loans and operating cash, which is included in interest income, net in the condensed consolidated statements of income. A portion of our revenue is not asset-based or correlated with the equity financial markets. 
 We regularly review various aspects of our operations and service offerings, including our policies, procedures and platforms, in response to marketplace developments. We seek to continuously improve and enhance aspects of our operations and service offerings in order to position our advisors for long-term growth and to align with competitive and regulatory developments. For example, we regularly review the structure and fees of our products and services, including related disclosures, in the context of the changing regulatory environment and competitive landscape for advisory and brokerage accounts.

 (9) Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as adjusted net income, a non-GAAP financial measure defined as net income plus the after-tax impact of amortization of other intangibles, acquisition costs, and certain regulatory charges, divided by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding for the applicable period. The Company presents adjusted net income and adjusted EPS because management believes that these metrics can provide investors with useful insight into the Company s core operating performance by excluding non-cash items, acquisition costs, and certain regulatory charges that management does not believe impact the Company s ongoing operations. Adjusted net income and adjusted EPS are not measures of the Company's financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, earnings per diluted share or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Below is a reconciliation of net income and earnings per diluted share to adjusted net income and adjusted EPS for the periods presented (in millions, except per share data): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Adjusted Net Income / Adjusted EPS Reconciliation Amount Per Share Amount Per Share Amount Per Share Amount Per Share Net income / earnings per diluted share 255.3 3.39 224.3 2.91 787.9 10.45 848.7 10.82 Regulatory charge (15)

 (10) Gross profit is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as total revenue less advisory and commission expense; brokerage, clearing and exchange expense; and market fluctuations on employee deferred compensation. All other expense categories, including depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and amortization of other intangibles, are considered by management to be general and administrative in nature. Because our gross profit amounts do not include any depreciation and amortization expense, we consider our gross profit amounts to be non-GAAP financial measures that may not be comparable to those of others in our industry. We believe that gross profit amounts can provide investors with useful insight into our core operating performance before indirect costs that are general and administrative in nature.

 (11) EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA is defined as net income plus interest expense on borrowings, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and amortization of other intangibles. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA plus acquisition costs and certain regulatory charges. The Company presents EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA because management believes that they can be useful financial metrics in understanding the Company s earnings from operations. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not measures of the Company's financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP.

 (12) Core G A is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as total expense less the following expenses: advisory and commission; depreciation and amortization; interest expense on borrowings; brokerage, clearing and exchange; amortization of other intangibles; market fluctuations on employee deferred compensation; promotional (ongoing); employee share-based compensation; regulatory charges; and acquisition costs. Management presents core G A because it believes core G A reflects the corporate expense categories over which management can generally exercise a measure of control, compared with expense items over which management either cannot exercise control, such as advisory and commission expense, or which management views as promotional expense necessary to support advisor growth and retention, including conferences and transition assistance. Core G A is not a measure of the Company s total expense as calculated in accordance with GAAP.

 Legal and Regulatory Matters 
 The financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation by U.S. federal and state government agencies as well as various self-regulatory organizations. Compliance with all applicable laws and regulations involves a significant investment in time and resources, and we continue to invest in our compliance functions to monitor our adherence to the numerous legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business. Any new laws or regulations applicable to our business, any changes to existing laws or regulations, or any changes to the 
 6 

Table of Contents 

 interpretations or enforcement of those laws or regulations may affect our operations and/or financial condition. We seek to participate in the development of significant rules and regulations that govern our industry. 
 As a regulated entity, we are subject to regulatory oversight and inquiries related to, among other items, our compliance and supervisory systems and procedures and other controls, as well as our disclosures, supervision and reporting. For example, in August 2024, the Company received a request for information from the SEC regarding certain elements of the Company s cash management program for corporate advisory accounts, which based on the nature of the request we believe is part of an industry-wide inquiry. The Company has been cooperating with the request. Additional regulation and enhanced regulatory enforcement has resulted, and may result in the future, in changes to our service offerings and additional operational and compliance costs, as well as increased costs in the form of penalties and fines, investigatory and settlement costs, customer restitution and remediation related to regulatory matters. In the ordinary course of business, we periodically identify or become aware of purported inadequacies, deficiencies and other issues. It is our policy to evaluate these matters for potential legal or regulatory violations and other potential compliance issues. It is also our policy to self-report known violations and issues as required by applicable law and regulation. When deemed probable that matters may result in financial losses, we accrue for those losses based on an estimate of possible fines, customer restitution and losses related to the repurchase of sold securities and other losses, as applicable. Certain regulatory and other legal claims and losses may be covered through our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, which is chartered with the insurance commissioner in the state of Tennessee. 
 Assessing the probability of a loss occurring and the timing and amount of any loss related to a regulatory matter or legal proceeding, whether or not covered by our captive insurance subsidiary, is inherently difficult and requires judgments based on a variety of factors and assumptions. There are particular uncertainties and complexities involved when assessing the adequacy of loss reserves for potential liabilities that are self-insured by our captive insurance subsidiary, which depends in part on historical claims experience, including the actual timing and costs of resolving matters that begin in one policy period and are resolved in a subsequent period. 
 Our accruals, including those established through our captive insurance subsidiary at September 30, 2024, include estimated costs for significant regulatory matters or legal proceedings, generally relating to the adequacy of our compliance and supervisory systems and procedures and other controls, for which we believe losses are both probable and reasonably estimable. 
 The outcome of regulatory or legal proceedings could result in legal liability, regulatory fines or monetary penalties in excess of our accruals and insurance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. For more information on management s loss contingency policies, see Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies , within the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Economic Overview and Impact of Financial Market Events 
 Our business is directly and indirectly sensitive to several macroeconomic factors and the state of the financial markets in the United States. According to the most recent estimate from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the U.S. economy grew at an annualized pace of 2.8 in the third quarter of 2024 after growing at an annualized pace of 3.0 in the second quarter of 2024. Continued growth during the third quarter of 2024 was driven by strong consumer spending and real GDP growth resulting from the replenishment of inventories that had been drawn down earlier in the year. Businesses added roughly 557,000 jobs in the third quarter of this year, lower than the 802,000 jobs added in the first quarter but more than the 442,000 jobs added in the second quarter. The unemployment rate averaged 4.2 in the third quarter of 2024, up from 4.0 in the second quarter and 3.8 in the first quarter of 2024. The equity markets rose modestly as risk appetite increased after the Federal Reserve Fed cut rates in mid-September by a half of a percentage point. The S P 500 rose 5.9 and the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index rose 5.2 respectively during the third quarter of 2024. 
 Our business is also sensitive to current and expected short-term interest rates, which are largely driven by Fed policy. By the end of the third quarter of 2024, Fed policymakers reduced the target federal funds rate to a range of 4.75 to 5.00 . To the extent they pursue faster easing in monetary policy, the Federal Open Market Committee members will take into account the weakening job market, the inflation trajectory, and global financial conditions. 
 Please consult the Risks Related to Our Business and Industry section within Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about the risks associated with significant interest rate changes and the potential related effects on our profitability and financial condition.

 Revenue 
 Advisory 
 Advisory revenue represents fees charged to advisors clients advisory accounts on our corporate RIA advisory platform and is based on a percentage of the market value of the eligible assets in the clients advisory accounts. We provide ongoing investment advice and act as a custodian, providing brokerage and execution services on transactions, and perform administrative services for these accounts. Advisory fees are primarily billed to clients on a quarterly basis in advance, and are recognized as revenue ratably during the quarter. The performance obligation for advisory fees is considered a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and are satisfied daily. As the value of the eligible assets in an advisory account is susceptible to changes due to customer activity, this revenue includes variable consideration and is constrained until the date that the fees are determinable. The majority of these client accounts are on a calendar quarter and are billed using values as of the last business day of the preceding quarter. The value of the eligible assets in an advisory account on the billing date is adjusted for estimates of contributions and withdrawals to determine the amount billed, and accordingly, the revenue earned in the following three-month period. Advisory revenue collected on our corporate RIA advisory platform is proposed by the advisor and agreed to by the client and was approximately 1 of the underlying assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 We also support independent RIA firms that conduct their business through our separate registered investment advisor firms Independent RIAs advisory platform, which allows advisors to engage us for technology, clearing and custody services, as well as access the capabilities of our investment platforms. The assets held under an Independent RIA s investment advisory accounts custodied with LPL Financial are included in total advisory assets and net new advisory assets. However, the advisory revenue generated by an Independent RIA is not included in our advisory revenue. We charge separate fees to Independent RIAs for technology, clearing, administrative, oversight and custody services, which may vary and are included in our service and fee revenue in our condensed consolidated statements of income. 
 The following table summarizes the composition of advisory assets for the periods presented (in billions):

 _______________________________ 
 (1) Net new advisory assets consist of total client deposits into custodied advisory accounts less total client withdrawals from custodied advisory accounts, plus dividends, plus interest, minus advisory fees. We consider conversions from and to brokerage accounts as deposits and withdrawals, respectively. 
 (2) Market impact is the difference between the beginning and ending asset balance less the net new asset amounts, representing the implied growth or decline in asset balances due to market changes over the same period of time. 
 Advisory revenue increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023 due primarily to an increase in advisory asset balances and related market impacts.

 Commission 
 We generate two types of commission revenue: (1) sales-based commissions that are recognized at the point of sale on the trade date and are based on a percentage of an investment product s current market value at the time of purchase and (2) trailing commissions that are recognized over time as earned and are generally based on the market value of investment holdings in trail-eligible assets. Sales-based commission revenue, which occurs when clients trade securities or purchase various types of investment products, primarily represents gross commissions generated by our advisors and can vary from period to period based on the overall economic environment, number of trading days in the reporting period and investment activity of our advisors clients. We earn trailing commission revenue primarily on mutual funds and variable annuities held by clients of our advisors. See Note 3 - Revenue , within the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding our commission revenue by product category. 
 The following table sets forth the components of our commission revenue for the periods presented (in thousands): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change Sales-based 429,132 311,792 117,340 38 1,237,437 896,825 340,612 38 Trailing 377,400 331,808 45,592 14 1,102,587 973,386 129,201 13 Total commission revenue

 The increase in sales-based commission revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily driven by an increase in sales of annuities and fixed income securities as a result of the higher interest rate environment. The increase in trailing commission revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to an increase in sales of annuities and mutual funds in prior periods.

 (1) Net new brokerage assets consist of total client deposits into brokerage accounts less total client withdrawals from brokerage accounts, plus dividends, plus interest. We consider conversions from and to advisory accounts as deposits and withdrawals, respectively. 
 (2) Market impact is the difference between the beginning and ending asset balance less the net new asset amounts, representing the implied growth or decline in asset balances due to market changes over the same period of time. 
 Asset-Based 
 Asset-based revenue consists of fees from our client cash programs, fees from our sponsorship programs with financial product manufacturers and fees from omnibus processing and networking services (collectively referred to as recordkeeping ). Client cash revenue is generated on advisors clients cash balances in insured bank sweep accounts and money market accounts. We also receive fees from certain financial product manufacturers in connection with sponsorship programs that support our marketing and sales force education and training efforts. Compensation for these performance obligations is either a fixed fee, a percentage of the average annual amount of product sponsor assets held in advisors clients accounts, a percentage of new sales or a combination. Omnibus processing revenue is paid to us by mutual fund product sponsors or their affiliates and is based on the value of mutual fund assets in accounts for which the Company provides omnibus processing services and the number of accounts in which the related mutual fund positions are held. Networking revenue on brokerage assets is correlated to the number of positions we administer and is paid to us by mutual fund product sponsors and annuity product manufacturers. 
 Asset-based revenue increased by 41.1 million and 31.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 2023, primarily due to increases in other asset-based revenues that offset the decreases in client cash revenues for both the three and nine month periods. Client cash revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased compared to 2023 due to lower average client 
 10 

Table of Contents 

 cash balances during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our average client cash balances decreased to 42.6 billion compared to 46.0 billion in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our average client cash balances decreased to 43.3 billion compared to 50.2 billion in 2023. 
 Service and Fee 
 Service and fee revenue is generated from advisor and retail investor services, including technology, insurance, conferences, licensing, business services and planning and advice services, Individual Retirement Account IRA custodian and other client account fees. We charge separate fees to RIAs on our Independent RIA advisory platform for technology, clearing, administrative, oversight and custody services, which may vary. We also host certain advisor conferences that serve as training, education, sales and marketing events for which we charge sponsors a fee. Service and fee revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased compared to 2023, primarily due to increases in IRA custodian fees, business services and planning and advice services fees, FINRA fees, and fees relating to error and omission insurance. 
 Transaction 
 Transaction revenue includes transaction charges generated in both advisory and brokerage accounts from mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and fixed income products. Transaction revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased compared to 2023, primarily due to increases in the number of transactions and transaction charges for managed assets. 
 Interest Income, Net 
 Interest income is primarily generated from bank deposits, client margin loans, client cash account CCA balances segregated under federal or other regulations and advisor repayable loan s. Interest income, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased compared to 2023 primarily due to increases in interest earned on bank deposits, short-term U.S treasury bills, and margin loans as a result of increases in the related interest-earning asset balances during the periods. 
 Other Revenue 
 Other revenue primarily includes unrealized gains and losses on assets held by us in our advisor non-qualified deferred compensation plan and model research portfolios and other miscellaneous revenue, which is not generated from contracts with customers. Other revenue increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to higher realized and unrealized gains in our deferred compensation plan. 
 
 Expense 
 Advisory and Commission 
 Advisory and commission expense consists of the following: payout amounts that are earned by and paid out to advisors and institutions based on advisory and commission revenue earned on each client s account, production-based bonuses earned by advisors and institutions based on the levels of advisory and commission revenue they produce, compensation and benefits paid to employee advisors, share-based compensation expense from equity awards granted to advisors and institutions based on the fair value of the awards at grant date and the deferred advisory and commission fee expense associated with mark-to-market gains or losses on the non-qualified deferred compensation plan offered to our advisors. 
 The following table sets forth our payout rate, which is a statistical or operating measure, for the periods presented: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Payout rate 87.46 87.30 16 bps 87.16 86.75 41 bps 
 Our payout rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased compared to 2023, primarily due to the effect of changes in product mix, large bank integrations and pricing changes as compared to the prior periods.

 Compensation and Benefits 
 Compensation and benefits expense includes salaries, wages, benefits, share-based compensation and related taxes for our employees, as well as compensation for temporary workers and contractors. The following table sets forth our average number of employees for the periods presented: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Average number of employees 9,064 7,825 16 8,787 7,469 18 
 Compensation and benefits expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 22.7 million and 105.8 million, respectively, compared to 2023, primarily due to an increase in average headcount. 
 Promotional 
 Promotional expense includes business development costs related to advisor recruitment and retention, costs related to hosting certain advisory conferences that serve as training, sales and marketing events, and other costs that support advisor business growth. Promotional expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 32.9 million and 94.8 million, respectively, compared to 2023, primarily due to increases in recruited assets and advisors that led to higher costs to support transition assistance and retention and increases in large institutional onboarding costs. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expense relates to the use of property and equipment, which includes internally developed software, hardware, leasehold improvements and other equipment. Depreciation and amortization expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 13.7 million and 37.4 million, respectively, compared to 2023, primarily due to our continued investment in technology to support integrations, enhance our advisor platform and experience, and support onboarding of institutions. 
 Occupancy and Equipment 
 Occupancy and equipment expense includes the costs of leasing and maintaining our office spaces, software licensing and maintenance costs, and maintenance expense on computer hardware and other equipment. Occupancy and equipment expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 8.5 million and 19.2 million, respectively, compared to 2023, primarily due to increased expense related to software licenses and our technology portfolio. 
 Interest Expense on Borrowings 
 Interest expense on borrowings includes the interest associated with the Company s senior notes, senior secured Term Loan B Term Loan B and revolving credit facilities; amortization of debt issuance costs; and fees associated with the Company s revolving lines of credit. Interest expense on borrowings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 19.4 million and 59.8 million, respectively, compared to 2023, primarily due to increases as a result of the issuance of 750.0 million senior notes in November 2023 and 1.0 billion senior notes in May 2024. See Note 9 - Corporate Debt and Other Borrowings, Net, within the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 Amortization of Other Intangibles 
 Amortization of other intangibles represents the benefits received for the use of long-lived intangible assets established through our acquisitions. Amortization of other intangibles for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 4.7 million and 14.0 million, respectively, compared to 2023, primarily due to additional intangible assets acquired from acquisitions. 
 Brokerage, Clearing and Exchange 
 Brokerage, clearing and exchange expense includes expenses originating from trading or clearing operations as well as any exchange membership fees. These fees fluctuate largely in line with the volume of sales and trading activity. Brokerage, clearing and exchange expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 4.8 million and 13.1 million, respectively, compared to 2023 primarily due to an increase in the volume of trades and expenses for quote services.

 Other Expense 
 Other expense includes the costs of the investigation, settlement and resolution of regulatory matters (including customer restitution and remediation), licensing fees, insurance, broker-dealer regulatory fees, travel-related expenses, fair value adjustments to contingent consideration liabilities, and other miscellaneous expenses. Other expense depends in part on the size and timing of resolving regulatory matters and the availability of self-insurance coverage, which depends in part on the amount and timing of resolving historical claims. Other expense decreased by 15.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily as a result of a decrease in regulatory charges recognized in the current period as compared to the same period in 2023. Other expense increased by 16.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to increases in fair value adjustments to our contingent consideration liabilities offset by a decrease in regulatory charges as compared to the same period in 2023. See Note 4 - Acquisitions, within the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 Our effective income tax rate was 26.5 and 29.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 25.1 and 26.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company s effective income tax rate differs from the federal corporate tax rate of 21.0 , primarily as a result of state taxes, reserves for uncertain tax positions and non-deductible expenses. Our effective income tax rate is reduced by tax benefits received from income tax credits as well as share-based compensation vesting and exercises . The decrease in our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by lower non-deductible expenses through the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the same periods in the prior year. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We have established liquidity and capital policies intended to support the execution of strategic initiatives, while meeting regulatory capital requirements and maintaining ongoing and sufficient liquidity. We believe liquidity is of critical importance to the Company and, in particular, to LPL Financial, our primary broker-dealer subsidiary. The objective of our policies is to ensure that we can meet our strategic, operational and regulatory liquidity and capital requirements under both normal operating conditions and under periods of stress in the financial markets. 
 Liquidity 
 Our liquidity needs are primarily driven by capital requirements at LPL Financial, interest due on our corporate debt and other capital returns to stockholders. Our liquidity needs at LPL Financial are driven primarily by the level and volatility of our client activity. Management maintains a set of liquidity sources and monitors certain business trends and market metrics closely in an effort to ensure we have sufficient liquidity. We believe that based on current levels of cash flows from operations and anticipated growth, together with available cash balances and external liquidity sources, we have adequate liquidity to satisfy our short-term and long-term working capital needs, the payment of all of our obligations and the funding of anticipated capital expenditures. 
 Parent Company Liquidity 
 LPL Holdings, Inc. (the Parent ), the direct holding company of our operating subsidiaries, considers its primary sources of liquidity to be dividends from and excess capital generated by LPL Financial, as well as capacity for additional borrowing under its 2.25 billion s ecured revolving credit facility, which it has the ability to borrow against for working capital and general corporate purposes. 
 Dividends from and excess capital generated by LPL Financial are primarily generated through our cash flow from operations. Subject to regulatory approval or notification, capital generated by regulated subsidiaries can be distributed to the Parent to the extent the capital levels exceed regulatory requirements, Credit Agreement requirements and internal capital thresholds. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, LPL Financial paid dividends of 410.0 million and 605.0 million to the Parent, respectively. 
 We believe Corporate Cash, a component of cash and equivalents, is a useful measure of the Parent s liquidity as it represents the capital available for use in excess of the amount we are required to maintain pursuant to the Credit Agreement. Corporate Cash is the sum of cash and equivalents from the following: (1) cash and equivalents held at the Parent, (2) cash and equivalents held at regulated subsidiaries as defined by the Credit Agreement, which include LPL Financial and The Private Trust Company, N.A. PTC ), in excess of the capital requirements of the Credit Agreement (which, in the case of LPL Financial, is net capital in excess of 10 of its aggregate debits, or five times the net capital required in accordance with Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1) and (3) cash and equivalents held at non-regulated subsidiaries.

The following table presents the components of Corporate Cash (in thousands): 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Cash and equivalents 1,474,954 465,671 Cash at regulated subsidiaries (992,450) (410,313) Excess cash at regulated subsidiaries per the Credit Agreement 225,886 128,327 Corporate Cash 708,390 183,685 Corporate Cash Cash at the Parent 435,109 26,587 Excess cash at regulated subsidiaries per the Credit Agreement 225,886 128,327 Cash at non-regulated subsidiaries 47,395 28,771 Corporate Cash 708,390 183,685 
 Corporate Cash is monitored as part of our liquidity risk management strategy, and we target maintaining approximately 200 million of Corporate Cash to meet our near-term corporate debt obligations. Corporate Cash increased by 524.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily as a result of proceeds received from our 1.0 billion debt issuance in May 2024 offset by the repayment of balances outstanding on our senior secured revolving credit facility. On October 1, 2024, we used a combination of corporate cash on hand and borrowings under our secured revolving credit facility to fund the acquisition of Atria. See Note 4 - Acquisitions and Note 9 - Corporate Debt and Other Borrowings, Net , within the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 We actively monitor changes to our liquidity needs caused by general business volumes and price volatility, including higher margin requirements of clearing corporations and exchanges, and stress scenarios involving a sustained market downturn and the persistence of current interest rates. We believe that based on current levels of operations and anticipated growth, our cash flow from operations, together with other available sources of funds, which include five uncommitted lines of credit, the revolving credit facility established through our Credit Agreement and the committed revolving credit facility of LPL Financial, will provide us with adequate liquidity to satisfy our short-term and long-term working capital needs, the payment of all of our obligations and the funding of anticipated capital expenditures. 
 We regularly evaluate our existing indebtedness, including potential issuances and refinancing opportunities, based on a number of factors, including our capital requirements, future prospects, contractual restrictions, the availability of refinancing on attractive terms and general market conditions. As of September 30, 2024, the earliest principal maturity date for our corporate debt with outstanding balances is in 2026 and our revolving credit facilities and uncommitted lines of credit mature between 2025 and 2029. 
 Share Repurchases 
 We engage in a share repurchase program that was approved by our Board, pursuant to which we may repurchase our issued and outstanding shares of common stock from time to time. Purchases may be effected in open market or privately negotiated transactions. Our current capital deployment framework remains focused on investing in organic growth first, pursuing acquisitions where appropriate and returning excess capital to stockholders. As a result of our planned acquisition of Atria, we paused share repurchases beginning in the first quarter of 2024. We expect to resume share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had 830.0 million remaining under our existing share repurchase program. The timing and amount of share repurchases, if any, is determined at our discretion within the constraints of our Credit Agreement, applicable laws and consideration of our general liquidity needs. See Note 11 - Stockholders Equity , within the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our share repurchases. 
 Common Stock Dividends 
 The payment, timing and amount of any dividends are subject to approval by LPLFH s Board, as well as certain limits under our Credit Agreement. See Note 11 - Stockholders Equity , within the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our dividends.

 LPL Financial Liquidity 
 LPL Financial relies primarily on client payables to fund margin lending. LPL Financial maintains additional liquidity through external lines of credit totaling 1.2 billion at September 30, 2024. LPL Financial also maintains a line of credit with the Parent. 
 External Liquidity Sources 
 The following table presents amounts outstanding and available under our external lines of credit at September 30, 2024 (in millions):

 _______________________________ 
 (1) The Company borrowed 910.0 million under its senior secured revolving credit facility on October 1, 2024 to fund the acquisition of Atria. See Note 4 - Acquisitions, within the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 Capital Resources 
 The Company seeks to manage capital levels in support of its business strategy of generating and effectively deploying capital for the benefit of our stockholders. 
 Our primary requirement for working capital relates to funds we loan to our advisors clients for trading conducted on margin and funds we are required to maintain for regulatory capital and reserves based on the requirements of our regulators and clearing organizations, which also consider client balances and trading activities. We have several sources of funds that enable us to meet increases in working capital requirements that relate to increases in client margin activities and balances. These sources include cash and equivalents on hand, the committed revolving credit facility of LPL Financial and proceeds from repledging or selling client securities in margin accounts. When an advisor s client purchases securities on margin or uses securities as collateral to borrow from us on margin, we are permitted, pursuant to the applicable securities industry regulations, to repledge, loan or sell securities, up to 140 of the client s margin loan balance, that collateralize those margin accounts. 
 Our other working capital needs are primarily related to loans we are making to advisors and timing associated with receivables and payables, which we have satisfied in the past from internally generated cash flows. 
 We may sometimes be required to fund capital requirements necessary to effect client transactions in securities markets and cash sweep balances held at third-party banks that arise from the delayed receipt of client funds. These capital requirements are funded either with internally generated cash flows or, if needed, with funds drawn on our uncommitted lines of credit at LPL Financial or one of our revolving credit facilities. 
 Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the SEC s Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act), which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital. LPL Financial, our primary broker-dealer subsidiary, computes net capital requirements under the alternative method, which requires firms to maintain minimum net capital equal to the greater of 250,000 or 2 of aggregate debit balances arising from client transactions. 
 The following table presents the net capital position of the Company s primary broker-dealer subsidiary (in thousands): 
 September 30, 2024 LPL Financial LLC Net capital 313,331 Less: required net capital 19,441 Excess net capital 293,890 
 15 

Table of Contents 

 Payment by our broker-dealer subsidiaries of dividends greater than 10 of their respective excess net capital during any 35-day rolling period requires approval from FINRA. In addition, each broker-dealer subsidiary s ability to pay dividends would be restricted if its net capital would be less than 5 of aggregate customer debit balances. 
 LPL Financial also acts as an introducing broker-dealer for commodities and futures. Accordingly, its trading activities are subject to the National Futures Association s NFA financial requirements and it is required to maintain net capital that is in excess of or equal to the greatest of NFA s minimum financial requirements. The NFA was designated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as LPL Financial s primary regulator for such activities. Currently, the highest NFA requirement is the minimum net capital calculated and required pursuant to the SEC s Uniform Net Capital Rule. 
 Our subsidiary PTC is also subject to various regulatory capital requirements. Failure to meet the respective minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have substantial monetary and non-monetary impacts on PTC s operations. 
 Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information

 Debt and Related Covenants 
 The Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, our ability to: 
 incur additional indebtedness or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock; 
 declare dividends, or other distributions to stockholders; 
 repurchase equity interests; 
 redeem indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to certain debt instruments; 
 make investments or acquisitions; 
 create liens; 
 sell assets; 
 guarantee indebtedness; 
 engage in certain transactions with affiliates; 
 enter into agreements that restrict dividends or other payments from subsidiaries; and 
 consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets. 
 Our Credit Agreement allows us to pay dividends and distributions or repurchase our common stock only when certain conditions are met. In addition, our revolving credit facility requires us to be in compliance with certain financial covenants as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. The financial covenants require the calculation of Credit Agreement EBITDA, as defined in, and calculated by management in accordance with, the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement defines Credit Agreement EBITDA as Consolidated EBITDA, which is Consolidated Net Income (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus interest expense on borrowings, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization and amortization of other intangibles, and is further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash charges and other adjustments, and to include future expected cost savings, operating expense reductions or other synergies from certain transactions. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance wi t h our Credit Agreement financial covenants, which include a maximum Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) or Leverage Ratio and a minimum Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) or Interest Coverage . The breach of these financial covenants would be subject to certain equity cure rights. The required ratios under our financial covenants and actual ratios were as follows: 
 September 30, 2024 Financial Ratio Covenant Requirement Actual Ratio Leverage Ratio (Maximum) 
 4.0 1.61 Interest Coverage (Minimum) 3.0 9.89 
 Certain restrictive covenants under certain of our Indentures are currently suspended. However, a credit rating downgrade to a below investment grade rating could cause currently suspended restrictive covenants under certain of our Indentures to be automatically reinstated. 
 See Note 9 - Corporate Debt and Other Borrowings, Net, within the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the Credit Agreement.

 Risk is an inherent part of our business and activities. To effectively manage these risks, we have an enterprise risk management ERM framework that is designed to facilitate the incorporation of risk assessment into decision-making processes across the Company, enable execution our business strategy, and protect our Company and its franchise. This framework aims to ensure policies and procedures are in place and appropriately designed to identify and manage risk at appropriate levels throughout our organization and within various departments. These control mechanisms attempt to ensure that operational policies and procedures are being followed and that our employees and advisors operate within established corporate policies and limits. Please consult the Risks Related to Our Technology and the Risks Related to Our Business and Industry sections within Part I, Item 1A.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about the operational risks that we face. 
 Regulatory and Compliance Risk 
 The regulatory environment in which we operate is discussed in detail within Part I, Item 1. Business in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 In the notes to our consolidated financial statements and in Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have disclosed those accounting policies that we consider to be most significant in determining our results of operations and financial condition and involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. There have been no changes to those policies that we consider to be material since the filing of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market Risk 
 We maintain trading securities and securities sold, but not yet purchased in order to facilitate client transactions, to meet a portion of our clearing deposit requirements at various clearing organizations, to track the performance of our research models and in connection with our dividend reinvestment program. Trading securities are included in investment securities while securities sold, but not yet purchased are included in other liabilities on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition and can include mutual funds, money market funds, debt securities and equity securities. We enter into market risk sensitive instruments for purposes other than trading, which are included in other assets on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition and can include deferred compensation plan assets invested in life insurance, money market and other mutual funds, investments in fractional shares held by customers, and other non-traded real estate investment trusts. Changes in the value of our market risk sensitive instruments may result from fluctuations in interest rates, credit ratings of the issuer, equity prices or a combination of these factors. 
 In facilitating client transactions, our trading securities and securities sold, but not yet purchased generally involve mutual funds, including dividend reinvestments. Our positions held are based upon the settlement of client transactions, which are monitored by our Trading and Operations department. 
 Positions held to meet clearing deposit requirements consist of U.S. government securities and equity securities. The amount of securities deposited depends upon the requirements of the clearing organization. The level of securities deposited is monitored by the settlements group within our Trading and Operations department. 
 Our Research department develops model portfolios that are used by advisors in developing client portfolios. We maintain securities owned in internal accounts based on these model portfolios to track the performance of our Research department. At the time a portfolio is developed, we purchase the securities in that model portfolio in an amount equal to the account minimum, which varies by product. 
 In addition, we are subject to market risk resulting from operational risk events, which can require customer trade corrections. We also bear market risk on the fees we earn that are based on the market value of advisory and brokerage assets, as well as assets on which trailing commissions are paid and assets eligible for sponsor payments. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of our trading securities was 94.7 million and securities sold, but not yet purchased were not material. The fair value of market risk sensitive instruments entered into for other than trading purposes included within other assets was 1.1 billion as of September 30, 2024. See Note 5 - Fair Value Measurements , within the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information regarding the fair value of trading securities; securities sold, but not yet purchased; and other assets associated with our client facilitation activities. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to risk associated with changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, 1.0 billion of our outstanding debt was subject to floating interest rate risk. While our senior secured term loan is subject to increases in interest rates, we do not believe that a short-term change in interest rates would have a material impact on our net income given revenue generated by our client cash balances, which is generally subject to the same, but off-setting, interest rate risk.

The following table summarizes the impact of increasing interest rates on our interest expense from the variable portion of our debt outstanding, calculated using the projected average outstanding balance over the subsequent twelve-month period (in thousands): Outstanding Balance at

 ) Our interest rate for our Term Loan B is locked in for one, two, three, six or twelve months as allowed under the Credit Agreement. At the end of the selected periods, the rates will be locked in at the then current rate. The effect of these interest rate locks are not included in the table above. 
 See Note 9 - Corporate Debt and Other Borrowings, Net, within the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 We offer our advisors and their clients two FDIC insured bank sweep vehicles and a client cash account CCA that are interest rate sensitive. Our FDIC insured sweep vehicles include an (1) insured cash account ICA for individuals, trusts, sole proprietorships and entities organized or operated to make a profit, such as corporations, partnerships, associations, business trusts and other organizations and (2) an insured deposit cash account DCA for advisory individual retirement accounts. Clients earn interest on deposits in the ICA and the DCA while we earn a fee. The fees we earn from cash held in the ICA are based primarily on prevailing interest rates in the current interest rate environment, and are therefore subject to interest rate risk. The fees we earn from the DCA are calculated as a per account fee, and such fees increase as the federal funds target rate increases, subject to a cap. 
 The Company places ICA sweep overflow into the CCA. These deposits are either used to fund client margin lending or placed in third-party bank or investment accounts, both of which are segregated under federal or other regulations, where they are held as cash or invested in short-term U.S. treasury bills. We earn interest income on these bank deposits and investments in short-term U.S. treasury bills and pay interest to clients on these CCA balances, which are sensitive to prevailing interest rates. This interest income and expense is included in interest income, net in the condensed consolidated statements of income. Changes in interest rates and fees for the deposit sweep vehicles are monitored by our Rate Setting Committee (the RSC ), which governs and approves any changes to our fees. By meeting promptly around the time of Federal Open Market Committee meetings, or for other market or non-market reasons, the RSC considers financial risk of the deposit sweep vehicles relative to other products into which clients may move cash balances. 
 Credit Risk 
 Credit risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in a borrower s, issuer s or counterparty s ability to meet its financial obligations under contractual or agreed upon terms. We are subject to credit risk from certain loans extended to advisors and institutions when we extend loans with repayment terms to facilitate advisors and institutions transition to our platform or to fund business development activities. We are also subject to credit risk when a forgivable loan to an advisor or institution converts to repayable upon advisor or institution termination or change in agreed upon terms. 
 Credit risk also arises when collateral posted with LPL Financial by clients to support margin lending or derivative trading is insufficient to meet clients contractual obligations to LPL Financial. Our credit exposure in these transactions consists primarily of margin accounts, through which we extend credit to advisors clients collateralized by securities in the clients accounts. Under many of these agreements, we are permitted to sell, repledge or loan these securities held as collateral and use these securities to enter into securities lending arrangements or to deliver to counterparties to cover short positions. 
 As our advisors execute margin transactions on behalf of their clients, we may incur losses if clients do not fulfill their obligations, the collateral in the clients accounts is insufficient to fully cover losses from such investments and our advisors fail to reimburse us for such losses. Our losses on margin accounts were not material during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. We monitor exposure to industry sectors and individual securities and perform analyses on a regular basis in connection with our margin lending activities. We adjust our margin requirements if we believe our risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions. 
 We are subject to concentration risk if we extend large loans to or have large commitments with a single counterparty, borrower or group of similar counterparties or borrowers, or if we accept a concentrated position as 
 47 

Table of Contents 

collateral for a margin loan. Receivables from and payables to clients and stock borrowing and lending activities are conducted with a large number of clients and counterparties and potential concentration is monitored. We seek to limit this risk through review of the underlying business and the use of limits established by senior management taking into consideration factors including current market conditions, the financial strength of the counterparty, the size of the position or commitment, the expected duration of the position or commitment and other positions or commitments outstanding.

 Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
