Liquidity 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a net loss of 
million, negative cash flows from operations of 
million and working capital of 
million. The Company s operating activities consume the majority of its cash resources. The Company anticipates that it will
continue to incur net losses and negative cash flows from operations as it executes its development plans for 2024 and beyond, as
well as other potential strategic and business development initiatives. The Company has previously funded, and plans to continue
funding, these losses primarily through current cash on hand, investments in marketable securities and additional infusions of cash
from equity and debt financing. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company raised net proceeds of approximately
 
million in connection with a warrant exercise program which is further discussed in Note 4 Stockholders Equity. On
November 6, 2024, the Company entered into an at-the-market offering agreement pursuant
to which the Company has an ability to issue and sell shares of its common stock 
up to an aggregate offering price of .
See Note 7 Subsequent Events for additional details. 

Based
on cash on hand and investments as of the date these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were issued, which includes
 million of net proceeds from the warrant exercise program, the Company believes it has sufficient cash to fund operations for at
least 12 months after the issuance date of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

However,
the Company s current funds will not be sufficient to enable the Company to fully complete its development activities or attain
profitable operations. If the Company is unable to obtain such needed additional financing on a timely basis, the Company may have to
curtail its development, marketing and promotional activities, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company s business,
financial condition and results of operations, and ultimately the Company could be forced to discontinue its operations and liquidate. 

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplate
continuation of the Company as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of
business. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not
necessarily purport to represent realizable or settlement values. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

per banking institution. The Company had deposits in excess of FDIC coverage of 
and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not experienced
losses on this account. 

and deferred contract costs as
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

The
Company recognizes bill-and-hold revenue from its sale of cosmetic vials warehoused at a Company location for a specified period of time
in accordance with directions received from the Company s customer. Even though the vials are held at a Company location, a sale
is recognized at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the product. Control is transferred to the customer in a bill-and-hold
arrangement when: (i) customer acceptance specifications have been met, (ii) legal title has transferred, (iii) the customer has a present
obligation to pay for the product and (iv) the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer. Additionally, all the
following bill-and-hold criteria have to be met in order for control to be transferred to the customer: 

the
 reason for the bill-and-hold arrangement is substantive 

the
 customer has requested the product be warehoused 

the
 product has been identified as separately belonging to the customer 

the
 product is currently ready for physical transfer to the customer 

the
 Company does not have the ability to use the product or direct it to another customer.

All outstanding convertible preferred stock is considered common stock at the beginning of the period or at the time of issuance, if
later, pursuant to the if-converted method. Since the effect of common stock equivalents is anti-dilutive with respect to losses, options,
warrants, restricted stock units RSUs and convertible preferred stock have been excluded from the Company s computation

On September 19, 2024, the Company held its Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the Annual Meeting ). At the Annual Meeting,
the Company s stockholders approved the amendment to the 2021 Plan to increase such number of authorized shares. 

Warrant
Exercise and Issuance 

On
February 6, 2024, the Company entered into agreements with certain holders of its existing warrants exercisable for an aggregate of 
shares of its Common Stock (collectively, the Existing Warrants ), to exercise their warrants at a reduced exercise price
of per share, in exchange for the issuance of new warrants (the New Warrants as described below (the Warrant
Exercise and Issuance ). The aggregate gross proceeds from the exercise of the Existing Warrants and the payment of the New Warrants,
as described below, was approximately million, before deducting cash issuance costs in the amount of . The reduction of
the exercise price of the Existing Warrants and the issuance of the New Warrants was structured as an at-market transaction under Nasdaq
rules. Of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Existing Warrants, through September 30, 2024, the Company
had issued an aggregate of shares of Common Stock. The remaining shares of Common Stock, which are issuable to Auctus
Fund, LLC Auctus ), are being held in abeyance due to Auctus maximum beneficial ownership limitation (the
 Abeyance Shares . Such Abeyance Shares have been fully paid for and are issuable upon notice from Auctus to the
Company. 

In
consideration for the immediate exercise of the Existing Warrants for cash and the payment of per share underlying the New Warrants,
the exercising holders received the New Warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(a)(2)
of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). The New Warrants will be exercisable for a period of five
years into an aggregate of shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of per share. The securities offered in the private
placement have not been registered under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws. Accordingly, the securities may not
be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an effective registration statement or an applicable exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and such applicable state securities laws. As part of the transaction, the Company agreed to file
a resale registration statement with the SEC to register the resale of the shares of Common Stock underlying the New Warrants issued
in the private placement. Such resale registration statement was filed and was declared effective by the SEC on April 18, 2024. 

In
connection with the transaction described above, the Company entered into a financial advisory services agreement, dated February 5,
2024, with Roth Capital Partners, LLC Roth ), pursuant to which the Company has paid Roth a cash fee of approximately 
for its services, in addition to reimbursement for certain expense. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred
an aggregate of of cash issuance costs related to the Warrant Exercise and Issuance. 

Prior
to the Warrant Exercise and Issuance, the Existing Warrants were classified as derivative liabilities. Additionally, the Company analyzed
the form of the New Warrants and determined that they should be classified as derivative liabilities in
accordance with ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity. Under the New Warrants, the Company
does not control the occurrence of events, such as a tender offer or exchange, that may trigger cash settlement of the New Warrants and
not result in a change of control of the Company. As a result, such New Warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment. Additionally,
certain New Warrants contain adjustments to the settlement amount based on a variable that is not an input to the fair value of a fixed-for-fixed 
option as defined under ASC 815-40 and, accordingly, such New Warrants are not considered indexed to the Company s own stock and
are not eligible for an exception from derivative accounting. See Note 6 Fair Value Measurement
for details regarding the valuation of the Existing Warrants and New Warrants. 

The
Company determined the Warrant Exercise and Issuance
 to be an exchange by investors of Existing Warrants with an aggregate fair value of 
along with aggregate cash consideration of (consisting of paid to exercise the Existing Warrants and paid
for the New Warrants) for an aggregate of shares of common stock with an aggregate fair value of , New Warrants with
an aggregate fair value of and aggregate cash issuance costs of and, accordingly, the Company recorded a gain on
extinguishment of during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited
condensed consolidated interim financial statements and related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the related Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, both of which are contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A
(Amendment No. 1) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on June 11, 2024. 

Note
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect management s current views with respect
to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are projections in respect of future events or our future financial
performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, should, 
 expects, plans, anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts, 
 potential or continue or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements include
statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of us and members of our management team, as well as the assumptions
on which such statements are based. Prospective investors are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of
future performance and involve risk and uncertainties, and that actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such
forward-looking statements. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors,
including the risks set forth in the section entitled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A (Amendment No. 1)
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on June 11, 2024, any of which may cause our company s or our
industry s actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results,
levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements. These risks and factors include,
by way of example and without limitation: 

our
 ability to obtain financing needed to complete our clinical trials and implement our business plan; 

our
 ability to successfully develop and commercialize BRTX-100, our lead product candidate for the treatment of chronic lumbar disc disease,
 as well as our metabolic ThermoStem Program and commercial biocosmeceuticals platform; 

our
 ability to protect our proprietary rights; 

our
 ability to achieve and sustain profitability of the existing lines of business; 

our
 ability to attract and retain world-class research and development talent; 

our
 ability to attract and retain key science, technology and management personnel and to expand our management team; 

the
 accuracy of estimates regarding expenses, future revenue, capital requirements, profitability, and needs for additional financing; 

business
 interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism or disease outbreaks (such as the recent outbreak
 of COVID-19); 

our
 ability to attract and retain customers; 

our
 ability to navigate through the increasingly complex therapeutic regulatory environment; 

our
 ability to successfully engage in any new business lines that we pursue; and 

risks
 related to the restatement of our previously issued financial statements. 

19 

Although
we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels
of activity or performance. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend
to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results. 

Readers
are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports filed with the
SEC. We undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated
events or changes in the future operating results over time, except as required by law. We believe that our assumptions are based upon
reasonable data derived from and known about our business and operations. No assurances are made that actual results of operations or
the results of our future activities will not differ materially from our assumptions. 

As

Corporate
History 

Our
offices are located in Melville, New York where we have established a laboratory facility in order to increase our capabilities for the
further development of possible cellular-based treatments, products and protocols, stem cell-related intellectual property and translational
research applications. 

As
of September 30, 2024, our accumulated deficit was 154,042,567. We have historically only generated a modest amount of revenue, and
our losses have principally been operating expenses incurred in research and development, marketing and promotional activities in order
to commercialize our products and services, plus costs associated with meeting the requirements of being a public company. We expect
to continue to incur substantial costs for these activities over at least the next year. 

Business
Overview 

We
develop therapeutic products and medical therapies using cell and tissue protocols, primarily involving adult stem cells. 

We
are currently pursuing our Disc/Spine Program with our initial investigational therapeutic product being called BRTX-100 .
In March 2022, a United States patent issued in our Disc/Spine Program . We have received authorization from the FDA to commence
a Phase 2 clinical trial investigating the use of BRTX-100 in the treatment of chronic lower back pain arising from degenerative
disc disease. We have commenced such clinical trial through the execution of a CRO agreement with Professional Research Consulting, Inc.,
d/b/a PRC Clinical, the execution of clinical trial site agreements, patient enrollment, the commencement of patient procedures, the
purchase of manufacturing equipment and the expansion of our laboratory to include capabilities for clinical production. We have received
a license from the New York State Department of Health to act as a tissue bank for mesenchymal stem cell processing. In June 2023, we
received a unanimous recommendation from the Data Safety Monitoring Board to continue our Phase 2 clinical trial without any changes.
We have obtained a worldwide (excluding Asia and Argentina) exclusive license to use technology for investigational adult stem cell treatment
of disc and spine conditions, including protruding and bulging lumbar discs. The technology is an advanced stem cell injection procedure
that may offer relief from lower back pain, buttock and leg pain, and numbness and tingling in the leg and foot. We are investigating
the expansion of the clinic application of BRTX-100 to other indications within the body. 

20 

We
are also developing our ThermoStem Program . This pre-clinical program involves the use of brown adipose (fat) in connection with
the cell-based treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity as well as hypertension, other metabolic disorders and cardiac deficiencies.
United States patents related to the ThermoStem Program were issued in September 2015, January 2019, March 2020, March 2021, July
2021, June 2023 and December 2023; Australian patents related to the ThermoStem Program were issued in April 2017, October 2019,
and August 2021; Japanese patents related to the ThermoStem Program were issued in December 2017, June 2021, February 2022, June
2023, and July 2024; Israeli patents related to our ThermoStem Program were issued in October 2019, May 2020, and March 2022;
European patents related to the ThermoStem Program were issued in April 2020, January 2021, and July 2023 . 

We
have obtained a license for a patented curved needle device that is a needle system designed to deliver cells and/or other therapeutic
products or materials to the spine and discs or other potential sites. We anticipate that FDA approval or clearance will be necessary
for this device prior to commercialization. We do not intend to utilize this device in connection with our Phase 2 clinical trial with
regard to BRTX-100 . 

In
addition, in continuation of our mission of developing and commercializing cell-based biologics, we are seeking to develop a biologics-based
cosmetic products business. Pursuant to such business, we would formulate, manufacture and sell products designed for cosmetic and aesthetic
uses. In April 2024, we announced that we have entered into a five-year exclusive supply agreement with Cartessa Aesthetics, LLC Cartessa ),
a leading North American based aesthetic company, to supply to Cartessa our first commercial product. 

Revenue 

We
derived some of our revenue pursuant to a license agreement with a stem cell treatment company (the SCTC entered into
in January 2012, as amended in November 2015 and November 2022. Pursuant to the license agreement, the SCTC granted to us an exclusive
license to use certain intellectual property related to, among other things, stem cell disc procedures and we have granted to the SCTC
a sublicense to use, and the right to sublicense to third parties the right to use, in certain locations in the United States and the
Cayman Islands, certain of the licensed intellectual property. In consideration of the sublicenses, the SCTC has agreed to pay us royalties
on a per disc procedure basis. 

We
also derived our initial product revenue from our five-year exclusive supply agreement with Cartessa entered into in April 2024.

Revenues 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated 2,900 and 30,700, respectively, of royalty revenue in connection with
our sublicense agreement with the SCTC. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in disc procedures. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated 230,700 and 0, respectively, of cosmetic product sales revenue in

or 63 , as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in lab supply
expense of 246,384, an increase in recruitment costs for our Phase 2 clinical trial of 73,194, an increase in payroll expense of 141,079
and an increase in consulting expense of 12,680. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase in subsequent
fiscal periods. 

22 

General
and Administrative 

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, bonuses, payroll taxes and stock-based compensation to employees, as well
as corporate expenses such as legal and professional fees, investor relations and occupancy-related expenses. For the three months ended
September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses decreased by 1,142,999, or 49 , as compared to the three months ended September
30, 2023, primarily driven by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of 1,209,459 related to the vesting of awards, partially
offset by an increase in cash compensation to employees of 40,075 and an increase in professional fees of 11,836 primarily related
to the recent restatement of our historical financial statements. 

Interest
Income 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest income was 158,547, as compared to interest income of 61,667 for the three months

Grant
income 

Grant
income of 83,333 during the three months ended September 30, 2023 consists of funding received under a National Institutes of Health
Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase 1 grant, offset by related expenses. There was no grant income received during the three
months ended September 30, 2024. 

Other
Income 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, other income primarily related to gains from settlements of certain accrued expenses
and realized and unrealized gain on investments. 

Change
in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized a gain on the change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 1,036,464
and 7,693,753, respectively, related to the decrease in fair value of warrants that are accounted for as warrant liabilities.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Liquidity 

We
measure our liquidity in a number of ways, including the following: 

September 30, 
 2024 
 December 31, 
 2023 

(As Restated) 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents 
 1,489,444

 Investments held in marketable securities 
 11,598,417 
 10,181,618 
 
 Working capital 
 8,927,404 
 8,783,181 

Working
capital increased by 144,223 primarily due to the 7,505,646 of cash provided by financing activities which was partially offset by
 5,882,501 of cash used to fund our operations and 1,018,078 of cash used to fund our investments. 

Availability
of Additional Funds 

Based
upon our accumulated deficit of 154,042,567 as of September 30, 2024, along with our forecast for continued operating losses and our
need for financing to fund our current and contemplated clinical trials, we will eventually require additional equity and/or debt financing
to continue our operations. However, based on cash and cash equivalents and investments on hand, we believe we have sufficient cash to
fund operations for at least 12 months after the issuance date of these financial statements. 

Our
operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business, including amounts required to fund our clinical trials, working capital
and capital expenditures. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, including
our ability to successfully commercialize our products and services, competing technological and market developments, and the need to
enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement our product and service
offerings. 

We
may be unable to raise sufficient additional capital when we need it or raise capital on favorable terms. Future financing may require
us to pledge certain assets and enter into covenants that could restrict certain business activities or our ability to incur further
indebtedness and may contain other terms that are not favorable to our stockholders or us. If we are unable to obtain adequate funds
on reasonable terms, we may be required to significantly curtail or discontinue operations or obtain funds by entering into financing
agreements on unattractive terms. On November 6, 2024, we entered into an at-the-market offering agreement pursuant to which we have
an ability to issue and sell shares of our common stock up to an aggregate offering price of 3,614,170. 

Cash
Flows 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our sources and uses of cash were as follows:

net loss of 7,343,233, adjusted for net non-cash expenses of 1,520,670, and 59,938 of cash used in changes in operating assets and
liabilities. Net cash used in operating activities was 4,842,249 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to cash
used to fund the net loss of 8,113,710, adjusted for non-cash expenses of 2,885,196, and 386,265 of cash provided by changes in operating
assets and liabilities. 

Investing
Activities 

Net
cash used in investing activities was 1,018,078 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to a purchase of marketable
securities which used 18,294,566 of cash and a sale of marketable securities which provided 17,370,243 of cash. Net cash provided by
investing activities was 3,336,841 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a sale of marketable securities which
provided 18,089,372 of cash and a purchase of marketable securities which used 14,651,512 of cash. 

Financing
Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 7,505,646 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to net proceeds received in connection
with the exercise and issuance of warrants, compared to 2,265,700 net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023 due to the net proceeds from the at-the-market offering of our common stock. 

Effects
of Inflation 

We
do not believe that inflation had a material impact on our business, revenues or operating results during the periods presented. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

We
prepare our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which
require our management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets
and liabilities at the balance sheet dates, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. To
the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations
would be affected. We base our estimates on our own historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable after
taking account of our circumstances and expectations for the future based on available information. We evaluate these estimates on an
ongoing basis. 

We
consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were
highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from
period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact
on our financial condition or results of operations. There are items within our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
that require estimation but are not deemed critical, as defined above. 

For
a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies and related judgments, see Note 2 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 1. Financial Statements of this report. 

26 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Not
applicable. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing disclosure controls and procedures,
our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls
and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood
of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
of achieving the desired control objectives. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
we are required to perform an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the
Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024. 

Management
has completed such evaluation and has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable
assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosures. As a result of the material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting
described below, we concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 were not effective. 

Material
Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

A
material weakness, as defined in the standards established by Sarbanes-Oxley, is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal
control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated
financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following material weaknesses in our internal control over
financial reporting were present as of December 31, 2023 and continued to exist as of September 30, 2024: 

Lack
 of adherence to formal policies and procedures; 

Lack
 of risk assessment procedures on internal controls to detect financial reporting risks in a timely manner; 

Lack
 of sufficient formal management testing over documented formal procedures and controls, and time to evaluate continuous effectiveness
 of controls to achieve complete and accurate financial reporting and disclosures, including documented controls over the preparation
 and review of journal entries and account reconciliations; and 

Lack of design and implementation of effective controls over the accounting
for warrants issued in connection with equity financings. 

27 

Management s
Plan to Remediate the Material Weaknesses 

Management
has been implementing and continues to implement measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weaknesses
are remediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. The remediation actions include: 

Management
 personnel, including our Chief Financial Officer, are overseeing the financial reporting process and implementation of enhanced controls
 and governance; 

Engagement
 of external financial consulting firm with expertise in accounting for significant and complex non-routine transactions to continue
 to enhance financial reporting, financial operations and internal controls; and 

Documentation
 of key procedures and controls using a risk-based approach. 

Management
is committed to maintaining a strong internal controls environment and implementing measures designed to help ensure that control deficiencies
contributing to the material weaknesses are remediated as soon as possible. We have documented key procedures and controls using a risk-based
approach and have, therefore, made progress toward remediation. We continue to implement our remediation plan, which includes continued
engagement of an external financial consulting firm to enhance financial reporting and operations as well as design and implementation
of controls. We will consider the material weaknesses remediated after the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time,
and management has concluded, through testing, that the controls are operating effectively. 

Management
will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures over financial reporting on an ongoing
basis and is committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Other
than described above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our third quarter
of 2024 that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

An
investment in our common stock involves a number of very significant risks. You should carefully consider the risk factor set forth below,
the risk factors included in the Risk Factors section of Amendment No. 1 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year
ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on June 11, 2024, and the other information contained in that report and in this quarterly
report in evaluating the Company and its business before purchasing shares of our common stock. The Company s business, operating
results and financial condition could be adversely affected due to any of those risks. 

Risks
Related to Our Cell Therapy Product Development Efforts 

Our
activity as a contract manufacturer of biologic-based cosmetics could result in FDA enforcement for reasons outside of our control, which
could disrupt the development of our own product candidates or harm our reputation. 

We
manufacture a commercial product as a contract manufacturer for a third-party company, Cartessa Aesthetics, LLC Cartessa ).
While we believe the product we manufacture for Cartessa is intended for cosmetic uses, we (as the contract manufacturer) do not ultimately
have control over how the product is marketed. It is possible that the FDA could determine, based on how the product is marketed (among
other considerations), that it is intended for unapproved therapeutic use(s), which could result in the temporary or permanent suspension
of manufacturing and/or commercialization of the product and/or a wide range of enforcement actions, such as warning letters, recall,
 dear doctor letters, and others. If the FDA takes enforcement action against Cartessa or us in connection with this product,
it could have an adverse impact on our operations and/or harm our reputation as a biologics company. 

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use Of Proceeds 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we did not have any unregistered sales of equity securities.

to determine the consideration payable to the holders of common stock of the entities party to such acquisition or combination) may be
used for Awards under the Plan and shall not reduce the Shares authorized for grant under the Plan to the extent that grants of Awards
using such available shares are (i) permitted without stockholder approval under the rules of the principal securities exchange on which
the Common Stock is then listed, if applicable, and (ii) made only to individuals who were not employed by or providing services to the
Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to such acquisition or combination.

reason whatsoever, with or without Cause, and with or without notice, or to terminate or change all other terms and conditions of any
Participant s employment or engagement, except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a written agreement between the Participant

unless such Incentive Stock Option conforms to the applicable provisions of Section 422 of the Code. Any Incentive Stock Option granted
under the Plan may be modified by the Administrator, with the consent of the Participant, to disqualify such Option from treatment as
an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Code. To the extent that the aggregate fair market value of stock with
respect to which incentive stock options (within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, but without regard to Section

the Company or any parent corporation or subsidiary corporation of the Company (as defined in Section 424(e)
and 424(f) of the Code, respectively) exceeds one hundred thousand dollars 100,000), the Options shall be treated as Non-Qualified

Options and other incentive stock options into account in the order in which they were granted and the fair market value
of stock shall be determined as of the time the respective options were granted. In addition, to the extent that any Options otherwise
fail to qualify as Incentive Stock Options, such Options shall be treated as Nonqualified Stock Options. Any interpretations and rules
under the Plan with respect to Incentive Stock Options shall be consistent with the provisions of Section 422 of the Code. 

5.3

to a Greater Than 10 Stockholder, such price shall not be less than one hundred ten percent (110 of the Fair Market Value of a Share
on the date the Option is granted (or the date the Option is modified, extended or renewed for purposes of Section 424(h) of the Code).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right that is a Substitute Award, the exercise price per
share of the Shares subject to such Option or Stock Appreciation Right, as applicable, may be less than the Fair Market Value per share
on the date of grant; provided that the exercise price of any Substitute Award shall be determined in accordance with the applicable
requirements of Sections 424 and 409A of the Code. 

5.4
 Option and SAR Term . The term of each Option and the term of each Stock Appreciation Right shall be set by the Administrator in
its sole discretion; provided , however , that the term shall not be more than ten (10) years from the date the Option or
Stock Appreciation Right, as applicable, is granted, or five (5) years from the date an Incentive Stock Option is granted to a Greater
Than 10 Stockholder. Except as limited by the requirements of Section 409A or Section 422 of the Code, and subject to the limitations
set forth in the previous sentence, the Administrator may extend the term of any outstanding Option or Stock Appreciation Right, and
may extend the time period during which vested Options or Stock Appreciation Rights may be exercised, in connection with any Termination

made with respect to the Shares; provided , however , that, in the sole discretion of the Administrator, any extraordinary
distributions with respect to the Shares may be subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 7.3 hereof. In addition, with respect
to Restricted Stock that is subject to performance-based vesting (including the continuation of services for a specified period of time),

then-subject to restrictions at a cash price per share equal to the price paid by the Participant for such Restricted Stock or such other
amount as may be specified in an applicable Program or the applicable Award Agreement. The Administrator in its sole discretion may provide
that, upon certain events, including without limitation a Change in Control, the Participant s death, retirement or Disability,
any other specified Termination of Service or any other event, the Participant s rights in unvested Restricted Stock shall not

retain physical possession of any stock certificate until such time as all applicable restrictions lapse.

Stock as of the date of transfer of the Restricted Stock rather than as of the date or dates upon which the Participant would otherwise

a Participant arising in connection with any Award. The Administrator may in its sole discretion and in satisfaction of the foregoing
requirement allow a Participant to satisfy such obligations by any payment means described in Section 9.1 hereof, including without limitation,
by allowing such Participant to elect to have the Company or a Subsidiary withhold Shares otherwise issuable under an Award (or allow

to approve cash bonuses to designated Participants to be paid upon their exercise or receipt of (or the lapse of restrictions relating

engagements of the Participant or the Participant s successors in interest or shall be subject to disposition by transfer, alienation,
anticipation, pledge, hypothecation, encumbrance, assignment or any other means whether such disposition be voluntary or involuntary

term is defined in Rule 701(c)(3) of the Securities Act and General Instructions A(1)(a)(5) to Form S-8) through a gift or domestic relations
order. The transferred portion of a Non-Qualified Stock Option may only be exercised by the person or entity who acquires a proprietary
interest in such Option pursuant to the transfer. The terms applicable to the transferred portion shall be the same as those in effect
for the Option immediately prior to such transfer and shall be set forth in such documents issued to the transferee as the Administrator
may deem appropriate. After the death of the Participant, any exercisable portion of an Award may, prior to the time when such portion
becomes unexercisable under the Plan or the applicable Program or Award Agreement, be exercised by the Participant s personal representative
or by any person empowered to do so under the deceased Participant s will or under the then-applicable laws of descent and distribution.

of the Plan and any Program or Award Agreement applicable to the Participant, and to any additional restrictions deemed necessary or
appropriate by the Administrator. If the Participant is married or a domestic partner in a domestic partnership qualified under Applicable
Law and resides in a community property state, a designation of a person other than the Participant s spouse or domestic
partner, as applicable, as his or her beneficiary with respect to more than fifty percent (50 of the Participant s interest in
the Award shall not be effective without the prior written or electronic consent of the Participant s spouse or domestic partner.
If no beneficiary has been designated or survives the Participant, payment shall be made to the person entitled thereto pursuant to the
Participant s will or the laws of descent and distribution. Subject to the foregoing, a beneficiary designation may be changed
or revoked by a Participant at any time provided the change or revocation is delivered to the Administrator in writing prior to the Participant s
death.

thereon shall have lapsed and/or (ii) require that the stock certificates evidencing such Shares be held in custody by a designated escrow

power, endorsed in blank, relating to such Shares.

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator or required by Applicable Law, the
Company and/or its Subsidiaries may, in lieu of delivering to any Participant certificates evidencing Shares issued in connection with

In the event of any transaction or event described in Section 11.2(a) hereof or any unusual or nonrecurring transactions or events affecting
the Company, any Subsidiary, or the financial statements of the Company or any Subsidiary, or of changes in Applicable Law or Applicable
Accounting Standards, the Administrator, in its sole discretion, and on such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate, either by
the terms of the Award or by action taken prior to the occurrence of such transaction or event, is hereby authorized to take any one
or more of the following actions whenever the Administrator determines that such action is appropriate in order to prevent dilution or
enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan or with respect to any Award under the
Plan, to facilitate such transactions or events or to give effect to such changes in Applicable Law or Applicable Accounting Standards: 

(i)
To provide for the termination of any such Award in exchange for an amount of cash and/or other property, if any, equal to the amount
that would have been attained upon the exercise of such Award or realization of the Participant s rights (and, for the avoidance
of doubt, if as of the date of the occurrence of the transaction or event described in this Section 11.2, the Administrator determines
in good faith that no amount would have been attained upon the exercise of such Award or realization of the Participant s rights,
then such Award may be terminated by the Company without payment); 

(ii)
To provide that such Award be assumed by the successor or survivor corporation, or a parent or subsidiary thereof, or shall be substituted
for by similar options, rights or awards covering the stock of the successor or survivor corporation, or a parent or subsidiary thereof,
with appropriate adjustments as to the number and kind of shares and applicable exercise or purchase price; 

(iii)
To make adjustments in the number and type of securities subject to outstanding Awards and Awards which may be granted in the future
and/or in the terms, conditions and criteria included in such Awards (including the grant or exercise price, as applicable); 

(iv)
To provide that such Award shall be exercisable or payable or fully vested with respect to all securities covered thereby, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the Plan or an applicable Program or Award Agreement; 

19 

(v)
To replace such Award with other rights or property selected by the Administrator in its sole discretion; and/or 

(vi)
To provide that the Award cannot vest, be exercised or become payable after such event. 

(c)
In connection with the occurrence of any Equity Restructuring, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Sections 11.2(a) and 11.2(b)
hereof: 

(i)
The number and type of securities subject to each outstanding Award and the exercise price or grant price thereof, if applicable, shall
be equitably adjusted; and/or 

(ii)
The Administrator shall make such equitable adjustments, if any, as the Administrator in its discretion may deem appropriate to reflect
such Equity Restructuring with respect to the aggregate number and kind of shares that may be issued under the Plan. 

The
adjustments provided under this Section 11.2(c) shall be nondiscretionary and shall be final and binding on the affected Participant
and the Company. 

(d)
Except as may otherwise be provided in any applicable Award Agreement or other written agreement entered into between the Company (or
a Subsidiary) and a Participant, if a Change in Control occurs and a Participant s outstanding Awards are not continued, converted,
assumed, or replaced by the surviving or successor entity in such Change in Control, then, immediately prior to the Change in Control,
such outstanding Awards, to the extent not continued, converted, assumed, or replaced, shall become fully vested and, as applicable,
exercisable, and all forfeiture, repurchase and other restrictions on such Awards shall lapse. Upon, or in anticipation of, a Change
in Control, the Administrator may cause any and all Awards outstanding hereunder to terminate at a specific time in the future, including
but not limited to the date of such Change in Control, and shall give each Participant the right to exercise such Awards during a period
of time as the Administrator, in its sole and absolute discretion, shall determine. For the avoidance of doubt, if the value of an Award
that is terminated in connection with this Section 11.2(d) is zero or negative at the time of such Change in Control, such Award shall
be terminated upon the Change in Control without payment of consideration therefor. 

(e)
The Administrator may, in its sole discretion, include such further provisions and limitations in any Award, agreement or certificate,
as it may deem equitable and in the best interests of the Company that are not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan. 

(f)
Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, no adjustment or action described in this Section 11.2 or in any other provision of
the Plan shall be authorized to the extent it would (i) cause the Plan to violate Section 422(b)(1) of the Code or (ii) cause an Award
to fail to be exempt from or fail to comply with Section 409A of the Code. 

(g)
The existence of the Plan, any Program, any Award Agreement and/or any Award granted hereunder shall not affect or restrict in any way
the right or power of the Company or the stockholders of the Company or any Subsidiary to make or authorize any adjustment, recapitalization,
reorganization or other change in the Company s or such Subsidiary s capital structure or its business, any merger or consolidation
of the Company or any Subsidiary, any issue of stock or of options, warrants or rights to purchase stock or of bonds, debentures, preferred
or prior preference stocks whose rights are superior to or affect the Common Stock, the securities of any Subsidiary, or the rights thereof
or which are convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or securities of any Subsidiary, or any sale or transfer of all or any
part of its assets or business, or any other corporate act or proceeding, whether of a similar character or otherwise. 

20 

(h)
In the event of any pending stock dividend, stock split, combination or exchange of shares, merger, consolidation or other distribution
(other than normal cash dividends) of Company assets to stockholders, or any other change affecting the Shares or the share price of
the Common Stock including any Equity Restructuring, for reasons of administrative convenience, the Company in its sole discretion may
refuse to permit the exercise of any Award during a period of thirty (30) days prior to the consummation of any such transaction. 

11.3
 Approval of Plan by Stockholders . The Plan shall be submitted for the approval of the Company s stockholders within twelve
(12) months after the date of the Board s initial adoption of the Plan. Awards may be granted or awarded prior to such stockholder
approval; and, provided that if such approval has not been obtained at the end of said 12-month period, no Options previously
granted or awarded under the Plan shall qualify as Incentive Stock Options. 

11.4
 No Stockholders Rights . Except as otherwise provided herein or in an applicable Program or Award Agreement, a Participant shall
have none of the rights of a stockholder with respect to Shares covered by any Award until the Participant becomes the record owner of
such Shares, including the right to participate in any new issues of stock of the Company. 

11.5
 Paperless Administration . In the event that the Company establishes, for itself or using the services of a third party, an automated
system for the documentation, granting or exercise of Awards, such as a system using an internet website or interactive voice response,
then the paperless documentation, granting or exercise of Awards by a Participant may be permitted through the use of such an automated
system. 

11.6
 Effect of Plan upon Other Compensation Plans . The adoption of the Plan shall not affect any other compensation or incentive plans
in effect for the Company or any Subsidiary. Nothing in the Plan shall be construed to limit the right of the Company or any Subsidiary:
(a) to establish any other forms of incentives or compensation for Employees, Directors or Consultants of the Company or any Subsidiary
or (b) to grant or assume options or other rights or awards otherwise than under the Plan in connection with any proper corporate purpose
including without limitation, the grant or assumption of options in connection with the acquisition by purchase, lease, merger, consolidation
or otherwise, of the business, stock or assets of any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, firm or association. 

11.7
 Compliance with Laws . The Plan, the granting and vesting of Awards under the Plan, the issuance and delivery of Shares and the
payment of money under the Plan or under Awards granted or awarded hereunder are subject to compliance with all Applicable Law and to
such approvals by any listing, regulatory or governmental authority as may, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, be necessary or
advisable in connection therewith. Any securities delivered under the Plan shall be subject to such restrictions, and the person acquiring
such securities shall, if requested by the Company, provide such assurances and representations to the Company as the Company may deem
necessary or desirable to assure compliance with all Applicable Law. The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may take whatever actions
it deems necessary or appropriate to effect compliance with Applicable Law, including, without limitation, placing legends on share certificates
and issuing stop-transfer notices to agents and registrars. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Administrator may not
take any actions hereunder, and no Awards shall be granted, that would violate Applicable Law. To the extent permitted by Applicable
Law, the Plan and Awards granted or awarded hereunder shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such Applicable Law. 

21 

11.8
 Titles and Headings, References to Sections of the Code or Exchange Act . The titles and headings of the sections in the Plan are
for convenience of reference only and, in the event of any conflict, the text of the Plan, rather than such titles or headings, shall
control. References to sections of the Code or the Exchange Act shall include any amendment or successor thereto. 

11.9
 Governing Law . The Plan and any Programs or Award Agreements hereunder shall be administered, interpreted and enforced under the
internal laws of the State of Delaware without regard to conflicts of laws thereof. 

11.10
 Section 409A . To the extent that the Administrator determines that any Award granted under the Plan is subject to Section 409A
of the Code, the Plan, any applicable Program and the Award Agreement covering such Award shall be interpreted in accordance with Section
409A of the Code. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, in the event that, following the Effective Date, the Administrator
determines that any Award may be subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Administrator may adopt such amendments to the Plan, any applicable
Program and the Award Agreement or adopt other policies and procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive
effect), or take any other actions, that the Administrator determines are necessary or appropriate to avoid the imposition of taxes on
the Award under Section 409A of the Code, either through compliance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code or with an available
exemption therefrom. The Company makes no representations or warranties as to the tax treatment of any Award under Section 409A of the
Code or otherwise. The Company shall have no obligation under this Section 11.10 or otherwise to take any action (whether or not described
herein) to avoid the imposition of taxes, penalties or interest under Section 409A of the Code with respect to any Award and shall have
no liability to any Participant or any other person if any Award, compensation or other benefits under the Plan are determined to constitute
non-compliant, nonqualified deferred compensation subject to the imposition of taxes, penalties and/or interest under Section
409A of the Code. 

11.11
 No Rights to Awards . No Eligible Individual or other person shall have any claim to be granted any Award pursuant to the Plan,
and neither the Company nor the Administrator is obligated to treat Eligible Individuals, Participants or any other persons uniformly. 

11.12
 Unfunded Status of Awards . The Plan is intended to be an unfunded plan for incentive compensation. With respect
to any payments not yet made to a Participant pursuant to an Award, nothing contained in the Plan or any Program or Award Agreement shall
give the Participant any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company or any Subsidiary. 

11.13
 Indemnification . To the extent allowable pursuant to Applicable Law and the Organizational Documents, each member of the Board
and any officer or other employee to whom authority to administer any component of the Plan is delegated shall be indemnified and held
harmless by the Company from any loss, cost, liability, or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by such member in
connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit, or proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in which he or she may
be involved by reason of any action or failure to act pursuant to the Plan and against and from any and all amounts paid by him or her
in satisfaction of judgment in such action, suit, or proceeding against him or her; provided , however , that he or she gives
the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same before he or she undertakes to handle and defend it on
his or her own behalf. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which
such persons may be entitled pursuant to the Organizational Documents, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or any power that the Company
may have to indemnify them or hold them harmless. 

11.14
 Relationship to other Benefits . No payment pursuant to the Plan shall be taken into account in determining any benefits under
any pension, retirement, savings, profit sharing, group insurance, welfare or other benefit plan of the Company or any Subsidiary except
to the extent otherwise expressly provided in writing in such other plan or an agreement thereunder. 

11.15
 Expenses . The expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by the Company and its Subsidiaries.
