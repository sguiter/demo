 of credit from the Company. The loan will be repaid from the Bank s annual discretionary contributions to the ESOP, net of dividends paid, over a period of 
 years. Shares of the Company s common stock purchased by the ESOP are held in a suspense account until released for allocation to participants. When loan payments are made, shares are allocated to each eligible participant based on the ratio of each
 such participant s compensation, as defined in the ESOP, to the total compensation of all eligible plan participants. As the unearned shares are released from the suspense account, the Company recognizes compensation expense equal to the fair value
 of the ESOP shares during the periods in which they become committed to be released. To the extent that the fair value of the ESOP shares released differs from the cost of such shares, the difference is charged or credited to equity as additional
 paid-in capital. Any dividends on allocated shares increase participant accounts. Any dividends on unallocated shares will be used to repay the loan. Participants will receive shares for their vested balance at the end of their employment.
 Compensation expense related to the ESOP was thousand and thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and thousand and thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

ITEM 2. 

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from
 the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Our MD A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and
 related Notes included in Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Certain statements herein are forward-looking statements within the
 meaning of Section 21E of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act and Section 27A of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial
 performance. Forward-looking statements typically include words such as expect, estimate, project, budget, forecast, anticipate, intend, plan, may, will, could, should, believes, predicts, potential, continue, 
 poised, optimistic, prospects, ability, looking, forward, invest, grow, improve, deliver and other similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual future
 results to differ materially from historical results or from those anticipated or implied by such statements. Readers should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of their dates or, if no date is
 provided, then as of the date of this Form 10-Q. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent required by law.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Critical accounting policies are those that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial
 condition or results of operations under different assumptions and conditions. This discussion highlights those accounting policies that management considers critical. All accounting policies are important; therefore, you are encouraged to review
 each of the policies included in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K to gain a better understanding of how our financial performance is measured and reported.
 Management has identified the Company s critical accounting policies as follows:

Allowance for Credit Losses for Loans

The Company accounts for credit losses on loans in accordance with ASC 326, which requires the Company to record an estimate of expected lifetime credit losses for loans at the time
 of origination or acquisition. The ACL is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to provide for expected credit losses in the portfolio as of the date of the consolidated statements of financial condition. Estimating expected credit
 losses requires management to use relevant forward-looking information, including the use of reasonable and supportable forecasts. The measurement of the ACL is performed by collectively evaluating loans with similar risk characteristics. The
 Company measures the ACL for each of its loan segments using the weighted-average remaining maturity WARM method. The weighted average remaining life, including the effect of estimated prepayments, is calculated for each loan pool on a
 quarterly basis. The Company then estimates a loss rate for each pool using both its own historical loss experience and the historical losses of a group of peer institutions. The Company s ACL model also includes adjustments for qualitative
 factors, where appropriate.

Certain loans, such as those that are nonperforming or are considered to be collateral dependent, are deemed to no longer possess risk characteristics similar to other loans in the
 loan portfolio, because the specific attributes and risks associated with the loan have likely become unique as the credit quality of the loan deteriorates. As such, these loans may require individual evaluation to determine an appropriate ACL for
 the loan. When a loan is individually evaluated, the Company typically measures the expected credit loss for the loan based on a discounted cash flow approach, unless the loan has been deemed collateral dependent in which case the ACL is determined
 using estimates of the fair value of the underlying collateral, less estimated selling costs.

Overview

Total assets decreased by 2.3 million at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to decreases in securities available-for-sale of
 78.5 million, due to maturities and paydowns, cash and cash equivalents of 8.1 million, other assets of 1.3 million, and deferred tax assets of 1.1 million, partially offset by growth in net loans of 86.3 million.

Loans held for investment, net of the ACL, increased by 86.3 million to 966.8 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 880.5 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to
 loan originations of 136.2 million during the first nine months of 2024, which consisted of 65.7 million in multi-family loans, 46.6 million in commercial real estate loans, 17.6 million in other commercial loans, 5.5 million in construction
 loans, and 800 thousand in SBA loans, partially offset by loan payoffs and repayments of 49.9 million.

Deposits decreased by 10.4 million to 672.2 million at September 30, 2024, from 682.6 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease in deposits was attributable to a decrease of 33.1 million in
 liquid deposits (demand, interest checking, and money market accounts), a decrease of 7.4 million in savings deposits, and a decrease of 2.2 million in Certificate of Deposit Registry Service CDARS deposits, partially offset by an increase of
 32.2 million in Insured Cash Sweep ICS deposits and 148 thousand in other certificates of deposit accounts. As of September 30, 2024, our uninsured deposits, including deposits from affiliates, represented 34 
 of our total deposits, as compared to 37 as of December 31, 2023. 

Total borrowings increased by 1.6 million to 398.4 million at September 30, 2024, from 396.8 million at December 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase of 16.3
 million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase, partially offset by the payoff of two notes payable totaling 14.0 million during January 2024. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported net income attributable to Broadway Financial Corporation ("Broadway") of 522 thousand compared to
 net income attributable to Broadway of 91 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 431 thousand. Net loss attributable to common stockholders was 228 thousand during the third quarter of 2024 after
 deducting preferred dividends of 750 thousand, compared to net income attributable to common stockholders of 91 thousand for the third quarter of 2023.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported net income attributable to Broadway of 627 thousand compared to net income attributable to Broadway of 1.9
 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net loss attributable to common stockholders was 190 thousand during the first nine months of 2024 after deducting preferred dividends of 817 thousand, compared to net income attributable to
 common stockholders of 1.9 million for the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in net income attributable to the Company primarily resulted from an increase in non-interest expense of 3.0 million during the first nine months of 2024,
 compared to the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits expense of 1.4 million and professional services expense of 1.2 million. The increase in non-interest expense was partially offset by an increase
 of 1.5 million in net interest income and a decrease in income tax expense of 508 thousand during the first nine months of 2024, compared to the first nine months of 2023.

Results of Operations

Net Interest Income

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023

Net interest income before provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 8.3 million, representing an increase of 1.5 million, or 23.0 , from net interest
 income before provision for credit losses of 6.8 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase resulted from higher interest income of 4.2 million, partially offset by an increase in interest expense of 2.7 million. The increase in
 interest income was primarily due to growth of 141.8 million in average loans receivable and 95.9 million in average interest-earning deposits, which were partially offset by a decline of 71.0 million in average securities during the third
 quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023. In addition, the overall rate earned on interest-earning assets increased by 73 basis points as the Bank earned higher rates on the loan portfolio, as well as on interest-earning deposits. 
 The increase in interest income was partially offset by an increase in the average cost of funds, which increased to 3.23 for the third quarter of 2024 from 2.47 for the third quarter of 2023, due to higher average balances of borrowings and
 higher rates paid on deposits. Net interest margin increased to 2.49 for the third quarter of 2024 from 2.33 for the third quarter of 2023.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023

Net interest income before provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 23.8 million, representing an increase of 1.5 million, or 6.5 , from
 net interest income before provision for credit losses of 22.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase resulted from higher interest income of 11.8 million, partially offset by an increase in interest expense of 10.4
 million. The increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase of 144.1 million in the average balance of loans receivable and an increase of 88.2 million in average interest-bearing deposits, which were partially offset by a decrease
 of 47.8 million in average securities. In addition, interest income increased due to an increase of 63 basis points, or 15.6 , in the overall rate earned on interest-earning assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as the Bank
 earned higher rates on the loan portfolio, interest-bearing deposits and stock investments with the Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Bank. The increase in interest income was partially offset by an increase in the average cost of funds, which
 increased to 3.14 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.00 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to higher average balances of borrowings and higher rates paid on borrowings and deposits. Net interest margin decreased to
 2.38 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.60 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

The following tables set forth the average balances, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the periods indicated. All average balances are daily average
 balances. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred loan fees, and discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or expense. We do not accrue interest on loans on non-accrual status, but the balance of
 these loans is included in the total average balance of loans receivable, which has the effect of reducing average loan yields.

Provision for Credit Losses

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of 399 thousand , compared to a recovery of provision for credit losses of 2 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of
 1.2 million, compared to 808 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The provisions for credit losses during the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 include recoveries of provisions for credit losses for
 off-balance sheet loan commitments of 24 thousand and 26 thousand, respectively. The increases in the provisions for credit losses during the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to growth in the loan
 portfolio. 

The allowance for credit losses ACL increased to 8.5 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 7.3 million as of
 December 31, 2023 due to growth in the loan portfolio. 

The Bank had one non-accrual loan at September 30, 2024 with an unpaid principal balance of 291 thousand. No loan charge-offs were recorded during the quarters or nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. 

Non-interest Income

Non-interest income for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 416 thousand, compared to 331
 thousand for the third quarter of 2023. 

For the first nine months of 2024, non-interest income totaled 995 thousand, compared to 880 thousand for the same period in the prior year.

Non-interest Expense

Total non-interest expense was 7.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 7.0 million for the third quarter of 2023, representing an increase of 613 thousand, or 8.8 . The increase
 was primarily due to an increase in professional and accounting fees in connection with the Company s remediation efforts of the weaknesses in internal controls that were identified during preparation of the financial
 statements for the third quarter of 2023. 

For the first nine months of 2024, non-interest expense totaled 22.7 million, representing an increase of 3.0 million, or 15.4 , from 19.7 million for the same
 period in the prior year. The increase primarily resulted from increases in compensation and benefits expense of 1.4 million and professional services expense of 1.2 million. The increase in compensation and benefits expense reflects
 the investment in additional executives and staff to support growth and strengthen overall controls and management depth. As previously reported, the Company hired a new Chief Financial Officer. The Company also hired a General Counsel and Chief
 Risk Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, and Treasurer during the first six months of 2024. The increase in professional services expense was primarily due to the costs associated with third-party professionals that
 were retained in connection with the Company s investigation of the weaknesses in internal controls that were identified during preparation of the financial statements for the third quarter of 2023. 

Income Taxes

The Company recorded an income tax expense of 209 thousand for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 39 thousand for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in income tax expense reflected an
 increase of 628 thousand in pre-tax income between the two periods. The effective tax rate was 27.76 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 31.20 for the third quarter of 2023.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, income tax expense was 298 thousand, compared to 806 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The
 decrease in income tax expense reflected a decrease in pretax earnings of 1.8 million between the two periods. The effective tax rate was 32.04 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to 29.49 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 .

Financial Condition

Total Assets

 2023. The increase was primarily due to loan originations of 136.2 million during the first nine months of 2024, which consisted of 65.7 million in multi-family loans, 46.6 million in commercial real estate loans, 17.6 million in
 other commercial loans, 5.5 million in construction loans, and 800 thousand in SBA loans, partially offset by loan payoffs and repayments of 49.9 million.

The following table presents loan categories by maturity for the period indicated. Actual repayments historically have, and will likely in the future, differ significantly from
 contractual maturities because individual borrowers generally have the right to prepay loans, with or without prepayment penalties.

Certain multi-family loans have adjustable-rate features based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate but are fixed for the first five years. Our experience has shown that these
 loans typically payoff during the first five years and do not reach the adjustable-rate phase. However, in the current high interest rate environment, we have seen more borrowers maintain their loans instead of paying them off due to interest rate
 caps which make the adjusted interest rate on their existing loan more desirable than getting a new loan at current interest rates. Multi-family loans in their initial fixed period totaled 592.4 million or 60.8 of our loan portfolio as of
 September 30, 2024.

Allowance for Credit Losses

The Company accounts for credit losses on loans in accordance with ASC 326 Financial Instruments-Credit Losses . ASC 326 requires the Company to recognize
 estimates for lifetime losses on loans and off-balance sheet loan commitments at the time of origination or acquisition. The recognition of losses at origination or acquisition represents the Company s best estimate of the lifetime expected credit
 loss associated with a loan given the facts and circumstances associated with the particular loan and involves the use of significant management judgment and estimates, which are subject to change based on management s on-going assessment of the
 credit quality of the loan portfolio and changes in economic forecasts used in the model. The Company uses the WARM method when determining estimates for the ACL for each of its portfolio segments. The weighted
 average remaining life, including the effect of estimated prepayments, is calculated for each loan pool on a quarterly basis. The Company then estimates a loss rate for each pool using both its own historical loss experience and the historical
 losses of a group of peer institutions during the period from 2004 through the most recent quarter. 

Since historical information (such as historical net losses) may not always, by itself, provide a sufficient basis for determining future expected credit losses, the Company
 periodically considers the need for qualitative adjustments to the ACL.

The Company has a credit portfolio review process designed to detect problem loans. Problem loans are typically those of a substandard or worse internal risk grade, and may consist
 of loans on nonaccrual status, loans that have recently been modified in response to a borrower s deteriorating financial condition, loans where the likelihood of foreclosure on underlying collateral has increased, collateral dependent loans, and
 other loans where concern or doubt over the ultimate collectability of all contractual amounts due has become elevated. Such loans may, in the opinion of management, be deemed to no longer possess risk characteristics similar to other loans in the
 loan portfolio because the specific attributes and risks associated with the loan have likely become unique as the credit quality of the loan deteriorates. As such, these loans may require individual evaluation to determine an appropriate ACL for
 the loan. When a loan is individually evaluated, the Company typically measures the expected credit loss for the loan based on a discounted cash flow approach, unless the loan has been deemed collateral dependent. The ACL for collateral dependent
 loans is determined using estimates of the fair value of the underlying collateral, less estimated selling costs.

The estimation of the appropriate level of the ACL requires significant judgment by management. Although management uses the best information available to make these estimates,
 future adjustments to the ACL may be necessary due to economic, operating, regulatory, and other conditions that may extend beyond the Company s control. Changes in management s estimates of forecasted net losses could materially change the level
 of the ACL. Additionally, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Company s ACL and credit review process. Such agencies may require the Company to recognize additions to the ACL based
 on judgments different from those of management.

Table of Contents 

The ACL was 8.5 million, or 0.87 of gross loans held for investment at September 30, 2024, compared to an ACL of 7.3 million, or 0.83 of gross loans held for investment, at
 December 31, 2023.

There were no recoveries or charge-offs recorded during the three or nine month periods ending September 30, 2024 or 2023.

Collateral dependent loans at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 totaled 36 thousand and 6.4 million, respectively. These loans had an ACL of 0 and 112 thousand as of
 September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

The Bank had non-accrual loans of 291 thousand at September 30, 2024. Loan delinquencies for 30 days or more, but less than 90 days, increased to 1.7
 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 780 thousand at December 31, 2023. There were no loans past due by greater than 90 days at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.

We believe that the ACL is adequate to cover currently expected losses in the loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024, but there can be no assurance that actual losses will not
 exceed the estimated amounts. The OCC and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC periodically review the ACL as an integral part of their examination process. These agencies may require an increase in the ACL based on their judgments of
 the information available to them at the time of their examinations.

Total Liabilities

Total liabilities decreased by 6.8 million to 1.1 billion at September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023, largely due to decreases of 14.0 million in notes payable and 10.4
 million in deposits, partially offset by an increase of 16.3 million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase.

Deposits

Deposits decreased by 10.4 million to 672.2 million at September 30, 2024, from 682.6 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease in deposits was attributable to a decrease of 33.1 million in
 liquid deposits (demand, interest checking, and money market accounts), a decrease of 7.4 million in savings deposits, and a decrease of 2.2 million in Certificate of Deposit Registry Service CDARS deposits, partially offset by an increase of
 32.2 million in Insured Cash Sweep ICS deposits and 148 thousand in other certificates of deposit accounts. As of September 30, 2024, our uninsured deposits, including deposits from Broadway and other
 affiliates, represented 34 of our total deposits, as compared to 37 as of December 31, 2023.

Borrowings

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding advances from the FHLB totaling 208.6 million and 209.3 million, respectively. The weighted interest rate
 was 4.35 and 4.91 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The weighted average contractual maturity was two months as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The advances were collateralized by loans with an
 unpaid balance of 484.4 million at September 30, 2024 and 435.4 million at December 31, 2023. The Company is currently approved by the FHLB of Atlanta to borrow up to 25 of total assets to the extent the Company provides qualifying collateral
 and holds sufficient FHLB stock. Based on collateral pledged and FHLB stock as of September 30, 2024, the Company was eligible to borrow an additional 133.9 million as of September 30, 2024.

The Company enters into agreements under which it sells securities subject to an obligation to repurchase the same or similar securities. Under these arrangements, the Company may
 transfer legal control over the assets but still retain effective control through an agreement that both entitles and obliges the Company to repurchase the assets. As a result, these repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized
 financing agreements (i.e., secured borrowings) and not as a sale and subsequent repurchase of securities. The obligation to repurchase the securities is reflected as a liability in the Company s consolidated statements of financial condition,
 while the securities underlying the repurchase agreements remain in the respective investment securities asset accounts. In other words, there is no offsetting or netting of the investment securities assets with the repurchase agreement
 liabilities. These agreements mature on a daily basis. As of September 30, 2024 securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled 89.8 million at an average rate of 3.68 . The fair value of securities pledged totaled 97.6 million as of
 September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled 73.5 million at an average rate of 2.60 . The fair value of securities pledged totaled 89.0 million as of December 31, 2023.

One relationship accounted for 92 of our balance of securities sold under agreements to repurchase as of September 30, 2024. We expect to maintain this relationship for the
 foreseeable future.

On December 27, 2023, the Company borrowed 100.0 million from the Federal Reserve under the BTFP. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 100.0 million was outstanding. The
 interest rate on this borrowing is fixed at 4.84 and the borrowing matures on December 29, 2024. Investment securities with a fair value of 94.3 million and 98.3 million were pledged as collateral for this borrowing as of September 30, 2024 and
 December 31, 2023, respectively. There are no prepayment penalties for early payoff. As the BTFP ended on March 11, 2024, no additional borrowings can be made under the program.

In connection with the New Market Tax Credit activities of the Company, CFC 45 is a partnership whose members include CFNMA and City First New Markets Fund II, LLC. This CDE acts in
 effect as a pass-through for a Merrill Lynch allocation totaling 14.0 million that needed to be deployed. In December 2015, Merrill Lynch made a 14.0 million non-recourse loan to CFC 45, whereby CFC 45 passed that loan through to a QALICB. The
 loan to the QALICB was secured by a Leasehold Deed of Trust that, due to the pass-through, non-recourse structure, is operationally and ultimately for the benefit of Merrill Lynch rather than CFC 45. Debt service payments received by CFC 45 from
 the QALICB are passed through to Merrill Lynch in return for which CFC 45 receives a servicing fee. This loan was paid off on January 18, 2024. The financial statements of CFC 45 are consolidated with those of the Company.

Stockholders Equity

Stockholders equity was 286.4 million, or 20.9 , of the Company s total assets, at September 30, 2024, compared to 281.9 million, or 20.5 of the Company s total assets at
 December 31, 2023. Book value per share was 14.97 at September 30, 2024 and 14.65 at December 31, 2023.

Table of Contents 

During the second quarter of 2023, the Company issued 92,720 shares of restricted stock to its officers and employees based on performance during 2022 under the Amended LTIP. All
 the shares issued to officers and employees vest over periods ranging from 36 months to 60 months.

On March 26, 2024, the Company issued 94,413 shares of restricted stock to its officers and employees under the Amended and Restated LTIP. Each restricted stock award was valued
 based on the fair value of the stock on the date of the award.

During February of 2023 and May of 2024, the Company issued 9,230 and 19,832 shares of stock, respectively, to its directors under the LTIP and Amended LIP, which were fully vested.

On April 5, 2024, the Company issued 31,645 shares of restricted stock to an officer under the Amended LTIP.

All common stock share amounts and per share amounts above have been retroactively adjusted, as applicable, for the 1-for-8 reverse stock split effective November 1, 2023. See Note 1. 

Tangible book value per common share is a non-GAAP measurement that excludes goodwill and the net unamortized core deposit intangible asset, which were both originally
 recorded in connection with the CFBanc merger. The Company uses this non-GAAP financial measure to provide supplemental information regarding the Company s financial condition and operational performance. A reconciliation between common book

Liquidity

The objective of liquidity management is to ensure that we have the continuing ability to fund operations and meet our obligations on a timely and cost-effective basis. The Bank s
 sources of funds include deposits, advances from the FHLB and other borrowings, proceeds from the sale of loans and investment securities, and payments of principal and interest on loans and investment securities. The Bank is currently approved by
 the FHLB of Atlanta to borrow up to 25 of total assets to the extent the Bank provides qualifying collateral and holds sufficient FHLB stock. Based on FHLB stock held and collateral pledged as of September 30, 2024, the Bank had the ability to
 borrow an additional 133.9 million from the FHLB of Atlanta. In addition, the Bank had additional lines of credit of 10.0 million with other financial institutions as of September 30, 2024.

The Bank s primary uses of funds include originations of loans, withdrawals of and interest payments on deposits, purchases of investment securities, and the payment of operating
 expenses. Also, when the Bank has more funds than required for reserve requirements or short-term liquidity needs, the Bank invests in federal funds with the Federal Reserve Bank or in money market accounts with other financial institutions. The
 Bank s liquid assets at September 30, 2024 consisted of 97.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and 35.0 million in securities available-for-sale that were not pledged, compared to 105.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and 186.0 million
 in securities available-for-sale that were not pledged at December 31, 2023. Currently, we believe the Bank has sufficient liquidity to support growth over the next twelve months and in the longer term.

The Bank had commitments to fund 923 thousand in loans that were approved but unfunded as of September 30, 2024. In addition, the bank had 3.7 million in unfunded line of credit
 loans and 47.5 million in unfunded construction loans as of September 30, 2024.

33 

Table of Contents 

The Bank has a significant concentration of deposits with two customers that accounted for approximately 12 of its deposits as of September 30, 2024. The Bank also has a
 significant concentration of short-term borrowings with one customer that accounted for 92 of the outstanding balance of securities sold under agreements to repurchase as of September 30, 2024. The Bank has long-term relationships with these
 customers and expects to maintain its relationships with them for the foreseeable future.

The Company s liquidity, separate from the Bank, is based primarily on the proceeds from financing transactions, such as the private placement completed in June of 2022 and previous
 private placements. The Bank is currently under no prohibition from paying dividends to the Company but is subject to restrictions as to the amount of the dividends based on normal regulatory guidelines.

The Company recorded consolidated net cash outflows from investing activities of 2.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 61.5 million during the
 nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash outflows from investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to the funding of new loans, net of repayments, of 87.6 million, partially offset by proceeds from
 principal paydowns on available-for-sale securities of 85.1 million. Net cash outflows from investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily due to funding of new loans, net of repayments, of 70.0 million,
 partially offset by 10.5 million in proceeds from principal paydowns on available-for-sale securities.

The Company recorded consolidated net cash outflows from financing activities of 9.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to consolidated net cash
 inflows of 52.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash outflows from financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to repayments of FHLB advances of 176.7 million and the 14.0
 million repayment of notes payable, partially offset by proceeds from FHLB advances of 176.0 million. Net cash inflows from financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily attributable to proceeds from FHLB
 advances of 329.0 million, partially offset by repayments of FHLB advances of 269.6 million.

Capital Resources and Regulatory Capital

The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain
 mandatory and possible additional discretionary, actions by the regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt
 corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank s capital
 amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk-weightings, and other factors. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank exceeded all capital adequacy requirements to
 which it is subject and meets the qualifications to be considered well capitalized. (See Note 10 Regulatory Matters.)

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information that we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under
 the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer PEO and Principal Financial Officer PFO ), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures, and is recorded,
 processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. There is no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures will operate effectively under all circumstances.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our PEO and PFO, management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
 (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of September 30, 2024. Based on their evaluation as of September 30, 2024, the PEO and PFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not
 effective at the reasonable assurance level because of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below.

A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a
 material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

The Company did not maintain a sufficient complement of personnel with appropriate levels of knowledge, experience, and training in internal control matters to perform assigned
 responsibilities and have appropriate accountability for the design and operation of internal control over financial reporting. The lack of sufficient appropriately skilled and trained personnel contributed to the Company s failure to: (i) design
 and implement certain internal controls; and (ii) consistently operate its internal controls. This matter was considered to be a material weakness in the Company s control environment.

The control environment material weaknesses contributed to other material weaknesses within the Company s system of internal control over financial reporting in the following COSO
 Framework components such that the Company did not design and implement effective controls, including the following:

Risk assessment The Company did not appropriately identify and analyze risks to achieve its control objectives. This ineffective risk assessment process limited the Company s ability to identify and remediate
 the weaknesses in the control activities, as described below.

Control activities The Company did not design and implement effective controls over the consolidation, financial statement reporting, and the monthly close processes, including the lack of effectively designed
 and implemented controls related to the preparation and review of account reconciliations with appropriate supporting documentation. Specifically, several general ledger account reconciliations were discovered to have unidentified or stale
 reconciling items.

Monitoring activities The Company s ongoing evaluation of internal controls failed to detect the issues described above, and as a result limited management s ability to correct and remediate the internal control
 issues in a timely manner.

Remediation Plan

In response to the material weaknesses that were identified, the Company has hired additional senior personnel with relevant experience and training in finance and accounting that
 will be able to assist the Company with appropriately assessing the risks of the Company and designing, implementing, and monitoring a system of internal control over financial reporting to address those risks. Related to the control over account
 reconciliations, the Company engaged a third-party firm to assist with reviewing general ledger account reconciliations to identify the population of account balance differences that were in need of correction. Such corrections were made to the
 consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023. Going forward, the Company s controls over general ledger account reconciliations will be strengthened to require the use of a reconciliation checklist, with a formal signoff by the
 preparer and reviewer on each reconciliation, as well as by a separate member of management as evidence that every account reconciliation was reviewed each month. In addition, the Company will also request that its internal audit firm perform
 additional testing on the enhanced controls over general ledger account reconciliation during its audits.

Management is actively engaged in the planning for, and implementation of, remediation efforts to address the material weaknesses. Additional time is required to complete the design
 and test the operating effectiveness of the applicable controls to demonstrate the effectiveness of the remediation efforts. The material weaknesses cannot be considered remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient
 period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.

Table of Contents 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Except for the remediation activities discussed above, there were no other changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specified above. Management does not expect, however, that our
 disclosure controls and procedures will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions, and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its
 objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
