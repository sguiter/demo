 These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in Viatris 2023 Form 10-K. The December 31, 2023 condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements. 
 The interim results of operations and comprehensive earnings (loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year or any other future period. 
 Beginning in 2024, upfront and milestone payments related to externally developed IPR D projects acquired directly in a transaction other than a business combination, which were previously included in cash flows from operating activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, are now classified as cash flows from investing activities. Certain reclassifications were made to conform the prior period condensed consolidated financial statements to the current period presentation. The adjustments resulted in an increase to net cash provided by operating activities and an increase to net cash used in investing activities of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Accounts Receivable Factoring Arrangements 
 We have entered into accounts receivable factoring agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our non-U.S. accounts receivable. These transactions are accounted for as sales and result in a reduction in accounts receivable because the agreements transfer effective control over and risk related to the receivables to the buyers. Our factoring agreements do not allow for recourse in the event of uncollectibility, and we do not retain any interest in the underlying accounts receivable once sold. We derecognized million and million of accounts receivable as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, under these factoring arrangements. Additionally, in 2023, we entered into a similar arrangement for certain European countries. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we have assigned and derecognized approximately million and million, respectively, of Trade Receivables, Net, which are now included in Other Receivables .

 million, potential contingent milestone payments (including million payable upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones, and billion payable upon the achievement of certain tiered sales milestones), as well as potential contingent tiered sales royalties. Viatris and Idorsia are both contributing to the development costs for both programs. Viatris has worldwide commercialization rights for both selatogrel and cenerimod (excluding, for cenerimod only, Japan, South Korea and certain countries in the Asia-Pacific region). A joint development committee is overseeing the development of the ongoing Phase 3 programs through regulatory approval. The agreements also provide Viatris a right of first refusal and a right of first negotiation for certain other assets in Idorsia s pipeline. The transaction expands our portfolio of innovative assets by adding two Phase 3 assets and combines our financial strength and worldwide operational infrastructure with Idorsia s proven, highly-productive drug development team and innovation engine. 
 
 In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the transaction has been accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction were recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the acquisition date. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred acquisition-related costs of approximately million, which were recorded primarily in SG A in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 The U.S. GAAP purchase price allocated to the transaction was million, which consisted of million of cash consideration paid and estimated contingent consideration at the date of acquisition valued at approximately million. The fair value of the contingent consideration was valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model using Level 3 inputs. The fair value is sensitive to changes in the forecasts of operating metrics, probability of success, and discount rates. Refer to Note 11, Financial Instruments and Risk Management for additional information. 
 IPR D Goodwill Total assets acquired Current liabilities Net assets acquired 

The preliminary fair value estimates for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were based upon preliminary calculations, valuations and assumptions that are subject to change as the Company obtains additional information during the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). The primary area subject to change relates to the finalization of income taxes. There were no measurement period adjustments during 2024. 
 The amount allocated to IPR D represents an estimate of the fair value of purchased in-process technology for research projects that, as of the closing date of the acquisition, had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. The fair value of IPR D of million was based on the excess earnings method, which utilizes forecasts of expected cash inflows (including estimates for ongoing costs) and other contributory charges. A discount rate of was utilized to discount net cash inflows to present values. IPR D is accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset and will be subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the projects. Upon successful completion and launch of each product, the Company will make a determination of the estimated useful life of the individual asset. Viatris and Idorsia will both contribute to the development costs for both programs, which are expected to be incurred through 2026. There are risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of the projects included in IPR D, including but not limited to the high cost and uncertainty of conducting clinical trials (particularly with respect to new and/or complex or innovative drugs), obtaining approval by relevant regulatory bodies and our partner s financial condition, and no assurances can be given that the underlying assumptions used to estimate the fair value of IPR D will not change or the timely completion of each project to commercial success will occur.

 The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually on April 1st or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. The Company performed the annual goodwill impairment test as of April 1, 2024. 
 The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test on a quantitative basis for its reporting units, North America, Europe, Emerging Markets, JANZ, and Greater China. In estimating each reporting unit s fair value, the Company performed an extensive valuation analysis, utilizing a discounted cash flow approach. The determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reporting unit s expected future cash flows. These estimates and assumptions, utilizing Level 3 inputs, primarily include, but are not limited to, the discount rate, terminal growth rates, operating income before depreciation and amortization, capital expenditures forecasts and control premiums. 
 
 When compared to the prior year s annual goodwill impairment test completed on April 1, 2023, due to certain macroeconomic conditions, the Company has experienced fluctuations in foreign exchange rates in certain international markets, combined with an increase in market interest rates. These conditions impacted all reporting units, with the most significant impact in JANZ and Emerging Markets. The impact in the other reporting units was offset by changes in other discount rate assumptions. 
 
 As of April 1, 2024, the allocation of the Company s total goodwill was as follows: North America billion, Europe billion, Emerging Markets billion, JANZ billion and Greater China billion. 
 In conjunction with its annual goodwill impairment test, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million during the second quarter of 2024 related to its JANZ reporting unit, which was recorded within SG A in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The impairment charge was primarily the result of a increase in the discount rate and a reduction in the terminal growth rate assumption for the reporting unit. 
 
 For the JANZ reporting unit at April 1, 2024, the Company forecasted cash flows for the next years. During the forecast period, the revenue compound annual growth rate was approximately negative . A terminal year value was calculated with a revenue growth rate applied. The discount rate utilized was and the estimated tax rate was . 
 Following the goodwill impairment charge recorded in the JANZ reporting unit, the carrying value of the reporting unit was equal to its estimated fair value as of April 1, 2024. If market conditions or the projected results were to change materially, it may be necessary to record further impairment charges to the JANZ reporting unit in future periods. 
 As of April 1, 2024, the Company determined that the fair values of the North America, Greater China, and Emerging Markets reporting units were substantially in excess of the respective unit s carrying value.

 million or for the annual goodwill impairment test. As it relates to the discounted cash flow approach for the Europe reporting unit at April 1, 2024, the Company forecasted cash flows for the next years. During the forecast period, the revenue compound annual growth rate was approximately . A terminal year value was calculated with a revenue growth rate applied. The discount rate utilized was and the estimated tax rate was . If all other assumptions are held constant, a reduction in the terminal value growth rate by or an increase in discount rate by would result in an impairment charge for the Europe reporting unit. 
 
 Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. In addition, changes in underlying assumptions, especially as they relate to the key assumptions detailed, could have a significant impact on the fair value of the reporting units.

These agreements may also include potential sales-based milestones and call for us to pay a percentage of amounts earned from the sale of the product as a royalty or a profit share.

 million which was accounted for as Acquired IPR D expense in the consolidated statements of operations during the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 During the first quarter of 2024, the Company was informed that Mapi received a Complete Response Letter CRL regarding the NDA for GA Depot 40 mg from the FDA. The Companies are reviewing the content of the CRL and will be determining the appropriate next steps. 
 The Company holds investments in preferred shares of Mapi that are accounted for at cost, less impairment, if any, adjusted for observable price changes, in accordance with ASC 321, Investments Equity Securities . During the second quarter of 2023, the Company made an additional investment of million in preferred shares of Mapi. The preferred shares are convertible on a one-to-one basis into Mapi ordinary shares at Viatris option. The Company recognized a gain of million during the second quarter of 2023 as a result of remeasuring our pre-existing equity interest in Mapi, which was recorded as a component of Other Income, Net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company has determined that Mapi represents a variable interest entity VIE ), but has concluded that Viatris is not the primary beneficiary of Mapi as we do not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance. Accordingly, we have not consolidated Mapi s results of operations and financial position into our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 As of each of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our condensed consolidated balance sheets included, within Other Assets , million related to our equity investments in Mapi, which included cumulative unrealized gains of million, and within Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets , million related to advances, including for initial orders of commercial launch supply of GA Depot under our supply agreement with Mapi.

 In France, the tax authorities have issued notices of assessments to the Company for the years ended December 2013 to December 2015 concerning our tax position with respect to whether income earned by a Company entity not domiciled in France should be subject to French tax. We have commenced litigation before the French tax courts where the tax authorities will seek unpaid taxes, penalties, and interest. 
 In India, the tax authorities have issued notices of assessments to the Company seeking unpaid taxes and interest for the financial years covering 2013 to 2018 concerning our tax position with respect to certain corporate tax deductions and certain intercompany transactions. Some of these issues were resolved through the Company entering into an agreement with the tax authorities in March 2023 in respect of the pricing of its international transactions. The Company recorded tax expense of approximately million during 2023 due to the terms of this agreement. The remaining issues are in the audit phase or are being challenged in the Indian tax courts. 
 
 In 2020, the Swedish Tax Authorities STA asserted an underpayment of tax against Meda A.B. for the tax years 2014 to 2019.

On September 16, 2022, the Court ruled in favor of Meda A.B. that no tax was due. The STA appealed that decision. On April 10, 2024, the Administrative Court of Appeals overturned the lower Court s ruling and issued a decision in favor of the STA upholding its original assessment.

 The Company is involved in various disputes, governmental and/or regulatory inquiries, investigations and proceedings, tax proceedings and litigation matters, both in the U.S. and abroad, that arise from time to time, some of which could result in losses, including damages, fines and/or civil penalties, and/or criminal charges against the Company. These matters are often complex and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. 
 In addition, in connection with the Combination, the Company has generally assumed liability for, and control of, pending and threatened legal matters relating to the Upjohn Business including certain matters initiated against Pfizer described below and has agreed to indemnify Pfizer for liabilities arising out of such assumed legal matters. Pfizer, however, has agreed to retain various matters including certain specified competition law matters to the extent they arise from conduct during the pre-Distribution period and has agreed to indemnify the Company for liabilities arising out of such matters. 
 While the Company believes that it has meritorious defenses with respect to the claims asserted against it and the assumed legal matters referenced above, and intends to vigorously defend its position, the process of resolving these matters is inherently uncertain and may develop over a long period of time, and so it is not possible to predict the ultimate resolution of any such matter. It is possible that an unfavorable resolution of any of the ongoing matters could have a material effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, ability to pay dividends and/or stock price. 
 Some of these governmental inquiries, investigations, proceedings and litigation matters with which the Company is involved are described below, and unless otherwise disclosed, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of the matter or to provide an estimate of the range of reasonably possible material losses. The Company records accruals for loss contingencies to the extent we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company is also involved in other pending proceedings for which, in the opinion of the Company based upon facts and circumstances known at the time, either the likelihood of loss is remote or any reasonably possible loss associated with the resolution of such proceedings is not expected to be material to the Company s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows, ability to pay dividends and/or stock price. If and when any reasonably possible losses associated with the resolution of such other pending proceedings, in the opinion of the Company, become material, the Company will disclose such matters. 
 Legal costs are recorded as incurred and are classified in SG A in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 EpiPen Auto-Injector Litigation 
 On February 14, 2020, the Company, together with other non-Viatris affiliated companies, were named as defendants in a putative direct purchaser class action filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas relating to the pricing and/or marketing of the EpiPen Auto-Injector. On September 21, 2021, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint asserting federal antitrust claims which are based on allegations concerning a patent settlement between Pfizer and Teva and other alleged actions regarding the launch of Teva s generic epinephrine auto-injector. Plaintiffs seek monetary damages, declaratory relief, attorneys fees and costs. A trial is currently scheduled to begin in July 2026. 
 
 Beginning in March 2020, the Company, together with other non-Viatris affiliated companies, were named as defendants in putative direct purchaser class actions filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota relating to contracts with certain pharmacy benefit managers concerning EpiPen Auto-Injector. The plaintiffs claim that the alleged conduct resulted in the exclusion or restriction of competing products and the elimination of pricing constraints in violation of RICO and federal antitrust law. These actions have been consolidated. Plaintiffs seek monetary damages, attorneys fees and costs. Class certification was denied. 
 In June 2024, the Company received a civil subpoena from the Attorney General of the State of Mississippi seeking information relating to the sales and/or marketing of EpiPen Auto-Injector. The Company is fully cooperating with this request and has communicated with certain other State Attorneys General regarding related issues. The issues covered in the Mississippi subpoena and the communications with certain other States generally relate to issues from litigations and/or investigations that have been previously disclosed, including the indirect purchaser class action that was resolved in 2022.

 The Company has a total accrual of approximately million related to these matters at September 30, 2024, which is included in other current liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Although it is reasonably possible that the Company may incur additional losses from these matters, any amount cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. In addition, the Company expects to incur additional legal and other professional service expenses associated with such matters in future periods and will recognize these expenses as services are received. The Company believes that the ultimate amount paid for these services and claims could have a material effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, ability to pay dividends and/or stock price in future periods. 
 Drug Pricing Matters 
 Department of Justice 
 Beginning in December 2015, the Company received subpoenas from the Antitrust Division of the DOJ seeking information relating to the marketing, pricing, and sale of certain of our generic products and any communications with competitors about such products. 
 On May 10, 2018, the Company received a civil investigative demand from the Civil Division of the DOJ seeking information relating to the pricing and sale of its generic drug products. 
 We had fully cooperated with these investigations, which we believe were related to a broader industry-wide investigation of the generic pharmaceutical industry. The Antitrust Division of the DOJ has advised that it no longer considers the Company, and its former President, a subject of its antitrust investigation. The Civil Division of the DOJ has also informed the Company that it does not expect to take any further actions in connection with its civil investigative demand. 
 
 Civil Litigation 
 Beginning in 2016, the Company, along with other manufacturers, has been named as a defendant in lawsuits filed in the United States and Canada generally alleging anticompetitive conduct with respect to generic drugs. The lawsuits have been filed by plaintiffs, including putative classes of direct purchasers, indirect purchasers, and indirect resellers, as well as individual direct and indirect purchasers and certain cities and counties. The lawsuits allege harm under federal laws and the United States lawsuits also allege harm under state laws, including antitrust laws, state consumer protection laws and unjust enrichment claims. Some of the United States lawsuits also name as defendants the Company s former President, including allegations against him with respect to a single drug product, and one of the Company s sales employees, including allegations against him with respect to certain generic drugs. The vast majority of the lawsuits have been consolidated in an MDL proceeding in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania EDPA ). Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages, restitution, declaratory and injunctive relief, attorneys fees and costs. The EDPA Court has ordered certain plaintiffs complaints regarding two single-drug product cases to proceed as bellwethers. The Company is named in those plaintiffs complaints that regard one of the two individual drug products and class certification and summary judgment motions are pending. 
 
 Attorneys General Litigation 
 On December 21, 2015, the Company received a subpoena and interrogatories from the Connecticut Office of the Attorney General seeking information relating to the marketing, pricing and sale of certain of the Company s generic products and communications with competitors about such products. On December 14, 2016, attorneys general of certain states filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against several generic pharmaceutical drug manufacturers, including the Company, alleging anticompetitive conduct with respect to, among other things, a single drug product. The complaint has subsequently been amended, including on June 18, 2018, to add attorneys general alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws, as well as violations of various states consumer protection laws. This lawsuit was transferred to the aforementioned MDL proceeding in the EDPA. The operative complaint includes attorneys general of states, the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The Company is alleged to have engaged in anticompetitive conduct with respect to four generic drug products. The amended complaint also includes claims asserted by attorneys general of states and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico against certain individuals, including the Company s former President, with respect to a single drug product. The amended complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, disgorgement, attorneys fees and costs, and certain states seek monetary damages, civil penalties, restitution, and other equitable monetary relief. The states claim for disgorgement and restitution under federal law in this case has been dismissed.

In addition, the Company expects to incur additional legal and other professional service expenses associated with such matters in future periods and will recognize these expenses as services are received. The Company believes that the ultimate amount paid for these services and claims could have a material effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, ability to pay dividends and/or stock price in future periods. 
 
 Citalopram 
 In 2013, the European Commission issued a decision finding that Lundbeck and several generic companies, including Generics [U.K.] Limited GUK ), had violated EU competition rules relating to various settlement agreements entered into in 2002 for citalopram. After various appeals, the European Commission s decision was upheld in March 2021. On March 28, 2023, bodies of the national health authorities in England Wales served a claim in the U.K. Competition Appeals Tribunal against parties to the citalopram investigation, including GUK, seeking monetary damages, plus interest, purportedly arising from the settlement agreements. GUK, beginning in approximately 2018, has received notices from other health service authorities and insurers asserting an intention to file similar claims. Pursuant to an indemnification agreement, Merck KGaA and GUK have agreed to equally share any damages claimed against Merck KGaA and/or GUK alleged to have been caused by the conduct which is the subject of the European Commission decision. 
 
 The Company has accrued approximately million as of September 30, 2024 related to this matter. It is reasonably possible that we will incur additional losses above the amount accrued but we cannot estimate a range of such reasonably possible losses at this time. There are no assurances, however, that settlements reached and/or adverse judgments received, if any, will not exceed amounts accrued. 
 
 Perindopril 
 
 In 2014, the European Commission issued a decision finding that Servier SAS, and certain of its subsidiaries Servier ), along with several generic companies, including the Company, had violated EU competition rules relating to various settlement agreements for perindopril. The settlement agreement involving the Company is a 2005 agreement entered into between Servier and Matrix Laboratories Ltd., which the Company acquired in 2007. After various appeals, the European Commission s decision was upheld in June 2024. The Company satisfied its monetary obligation in 2014. 
 
 The Company has received a notice from an organization representing health insurers in the Netherlands stating an intention to commence follow-on litigation and asserting monetary damages. Also, bodies of national health authorities in England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland served a claim in the English High Court against Servier, seeking monetary damages, plus interest, purportedly arising from the settlement agreements. Servier plans to seek to have all of the generic companies, including the Company, joined as defendants in this litigation. 
 
 Product Liability 
 Like other pharmaceutical companies, the Company is involved in a number of product liability lawsuits related to alleged personal injuries arising out of certain products manufactured/or distributed by the Company, including but not limited to those discussed below. Plaintiffs in these cases generally seek damages and other relief on various grounds for alleged personal injury and economic loss.

 The Company has accrued approximately million as of September 30, 2024 for its product liability matters. It is reasonably possible that we will incur additional losses and fees above the amount accrued but we cannot estimate a range of such reasonably possible losses or legal fees related to these claims at this time. There are no assurances, however, that settlements reached and/or adverse judgments received, if any, will not exceed amounts accrued. 
 
 Nitrosamines 
 The Company, along with numerous other manufacturers, retailers, and others, are parties to litigation relating to alleged trace amounts of nitrosamine impurities in certain products, including valsartan and ranitidine. The vast majority of these lawsuits naming the Company in the United States are pending in two MDLs, namely an MDL pending in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey concerning valsartan and an MDL pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida concerning ranitidine. The lawsuits against the Company in the MDLs include putative and certified classes seeking the refund of the purchase price and other economic and punitive damages allegedly sustained by consumers and end payors as well as individuals seeking compensatory and punitive damages for personal injuries allegedly caused by ingestion of the medications. Similar lawsuits pertaining to valsartan have been filed in other countries. Third party payor, consumer and medical monitoring classes were certified in the valsartan MDL. The Company has also received requests to indemnify purchasers of the Company s API and/or finished dose forms of these products. The original master complaints concerning ranitidine were dismissed on December 31, 2020. The end-payor plaintiff immediately appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which affirmed the dismissal. The personal injury and consumer putative class plaintiffs filed amended master complaints. The Company was not named as a defendant in the amended master complaints, though it was still named in certain short form complaints filed by personal injury plaintiffs. The trial court has dismissed all remaining claims against the generic defendants. Certain of the personal injury plaintiffs appealed this dismissal, which remains pending. 
 
 Lipitor 
 A number of individual and multi-plaintiff lawsuits have been filed against Pfizer in various federal and state courts alleging that the plaintiffs developed type 2 diabetes purportedly as a result of the ingestion of Lipitor. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages. In February 2014, the federal actions were transferred for consolidated pre-trial proceedings to an MDL in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina. The District Court granted Pfizer s motion for summary judgment and dismissed all of the federal cases in 2017, which was subsequently affirmed on appeal. Since 2016, certain cases in the MDL were remanded to certain state courts. State court proceedings remain pending in Missouri and New York. 
 
 Intellectual Property 
 The Company is involved in a number of patent litigation lawsuits involving the validity and/or infringement of patents held by branded pharmaceutical manufacturers including but not limited to the matters described below. The Company uses its business judgment to decide to market and sell certain products, in each case based on its belief that the applicable patents are invalid and/or that its products do not infringe, notwithstanding the fact that allegations of patent infringement(s) or other potential third party rights have not been finally resolved by the courts. The risk involved in doing so can be substantial because the remedies available to the owner of a patent for infringement may include, a reasonable royalty on sales or damages measured by the profits lost by the patent owner. If there is a finding of willful infringement, damages may be increased up to three times. Moreover, because of the discount pricing typically involved with bioequivalent products, patented branded products generally realize a substantially higher profit margin than generic and biosimilar products. The Company also faces challenges to its patents, including suits in various jurisdictions pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers, payers, governments, or other parties are seeking damages for allegedly causing delay of generic entry. An adverse decision in any of these matters could have an adverse effect that is material to our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, ability to pay dividends and/or stock price. 
 The Company has approximately million accrued related to its intellectual property matters at September 30, 2024. It is reasonably possible that we may incur additional losses and fees but we cannot estimate a range of such reasonably possible losses or legal fees related to these claims at this time.

 Yupelri 
 Beginning in January 2023, certain generic companies notified us that they had filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of Yupelri with associated Paragraph IV certifications. The companies assert the invalidity and/or non-infringement of polymorph patents expiring in 2030 and 2031, and a method of use patent expiring in 2039. The companies have not filed Paragraph IV certifications to our compound patents, which currently expire in December 2025, with one compound patent subject to a patent term extension to October 2028. Beginning in February 2023, we brought patent infringement actions against the generic filers in federal district courts, including the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, and the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania asserting infringement of the patents by the generic companies. The actions filed in Delaware, North Carolina and Pennsylvania have been dismissed and the remaining actions will proceed in New Jersey. The Company has entered into settlement agreements with Teva, Accord, Orbicular, Lupin, and Qilu granting licenses to commercialize their generic versions of Yupelri in April 2039 or earlier depending on certain circumstances. Three ANDA filers remain in the litigation. 
 
 Tyrvaya 
 In June 2023, a generic company notified Oyster Point that it had filed an ANDA with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of Tyrvaya with associated Paragraph IV certifications. The generic company asserts the invalidity and/or non-infringement of six Orange Book listed patents that all have expiration dates in October 2035. In July 2023, Oyster Point brought a patent infringement action against the generic filer in the U.S. District Court of the District of New Jersey asserting infringement by the generic company. In March 2024, Oyster Point filed an amended complaint asserting infringement with respect to additional patents that were recently listed in the Orange Book for Tyrvaya and also have expiration dates in October 2035. 
 
 Amitiza 
 In September 2023, Sawai Pharmaceutical Co. Sawai filed challenges with the Japanese Patent Office JPO asserting invalidity of patent term extensions for the JPP 4332353 patent (the 353 patent) relevant to Amitiza , which the Company commercializes in Japan as a licensee of the relevant patents, including the 353 patent. Towa Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. also filed a challenge to the 353 patent term extension in January 2024. Separately, in December 2023, Sawai filed an invalidity action with the JPO against the 353 patent itself. With the granted extensions, the 353 patent has expiration dates for the Company s 24 g and 12 g strengths of April 2025 and April 2027, respectively. Beginning in April 2024, Sawai filed challenges with the JPO with respect to the 12 g strength, asserting invalidity of patent term extensions of additional patents expiring in October 2025, September 2026, August 2027, November 2027, and December 2028, and challenged the validity of the August 2027 patent itself. 
 
 Other Litigation 
 The Company is involved in various other legal proceedings including commercial, contractual, employment, or other similar matters that are considered normal to its business. The Company has approximately million accrued related to these various other legal proceedings at September 30, 2024.

 Certain Market and Industry Factors 
 The global pharmaceutical industry is a highly competitive and highly regulated industry. As a result, we face a number of industry-specific factors and challenges, which can significantly impact our results. The following discussion highlights some of these key factors and market conditions. 
 54 

Table of Contents 

 The process of obtaining regulatory approval to manufacture and market new branded and generic pharmaceutical products is rigorous, time consuming, costly, and inherently unpredictable. Complex products are more difficult, costly and time-consuming to receive regulatory approval for and bring to market. Any delay in regulatory approval could impact the commercial or financial success of a product. Regulatory approval, if and when obtained, may be limited in scope. Even if regulatory approvals for new products are obtained, the success of those products is dependent upon market acceptance. 
 
 Generic products, particularly in the U.S., generally contribute most significantly to revenues and gross margins at the time of their launch, and even more so in periods of market exclusivity, or in periods of limited generic competition. As such, the timing of new product introductions can have a significant impact on the Company s financial results. The entrance into the market of additional competition generally has a negative impact on the volume and pricing of the affected products. Additionally, pricing is often affected by factors outside of the Company s control. Conversely, generic products generally experience less volatility over a longer period of time in Europe as compared to the U.S., primarily due to the role of government oversight of healthcare systems in the region. 
 For branded products, the majority of the product s commercial value is usually realized during the period in which the product has market exclusivity. In the U.S. and some other countries, when market exclusivity expires and generic versions of a product are approved and marketed, there can often be very substantial and rapid declines in the branded product s sales. For example, depending on certain factors including decisions by Japanese regulatory and/or patent authorities generic entry may occur for Amitiza 24 g in Japan in June or December 2025. 
 Certain markets in which we do business outside of the U.S. have undergone government-imposed price reductions, and further government-imposed price reductions are expected in the future. Such measures, along with the tender systems discussed below, are likely to have a negative impact on sales and gross profit in these markets. However, government initiatives in certain markets that appear to favor generic products could help to mitigate this unfavorable effect by increasing rates of generic substitution and penetration. 
 Additionally, a number of markets in which we operate outside of the U.S. have implemented, or may implement, tender systems for generic pharmaceuticals in an effort to lower prices. Generally speaking, tender systems can have an unfavorable impact on sales and profitability. Under such tender systems, manufacturers submit bids that establish prices for generic pharmaceutical products. Upon winning the tender, the winning company will receive priority placement for a period of time. The tender system often results in companies underbidding one another by proposing low pricing in order to win the tender. Sales continue to be negatively affected by the impact of tender systems in certain countries. 
 In addition to the impact of competition, government pricing actions and other measures designed to reduce healthcare costs, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could also be affected by other risks of doing business internationally, including the impact of inflation, elections, geopolitical events, including the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and between Russia and Ukraine and related trade controls, sanctions, supply chain and staffing challenges and other economic considerations, supply chain disruptions, foreign currency exchange fluctuations, public health epidemics, changes in intellectual property legal protections and other regulatory changes. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 Lexicon Licensing Agreement 
 In October 2024, the Company announced that it had entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Lexicon for sotagliflozin in all markets outside of the United States and Europe in exchange for an upfront payment of 25 million, and additional potential contingent payments, including regulatory milestones, sales milestones and tiered royalties ranging from low-double-digit to upper-teens on annual net sales. Viatris will be responsible for all regulatory and commercialization activities for sotagliflozin in the licensed territories. Lexicon will be responsible for providing clinical and commercial supply of sotagliflozin to Viatris. The Company currently expects to account for the transaction as an asset acquisition, with the upfront payment being expensed as in-process research and development in the fourth quarter of 2024.

 Idorsia Acquisition 
 On March 15, 2024, the Company acquired the development programs and certain personnel related to selatogrel and cenerimod from Idorsia in exchange for an upfront payment to Idorsia of 350 million, potential contingent milestone payments (including 300 million payable upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones, and 2.1 billion payable upon the achievement of certain tiered sales milestones), as well as potential contingent tiered sales royalties. Viatris has worldwide commercialization rights for both selatogrel and cenerimod (excluding, for cenerimod only, Japan, South Korea and certain countries in the Asia-Pacific region). A joint development committee is overseeing the development of the ongoing Phase 3 programs through regulatory approval. The agreements also provide Viatris a right of first refusal and a right of first negotiation for certain other assets in Idorsia s pipeline. The transaction expands our portfolio of innovative assets by adding two Phase 3 assets and combines our financial strength and worldwide operational infrastructure with Idorsia s proven, highly-productive drug development team and innovation engine. Viatris and Idorsia are both contributing to the development costs for both programs, which are expected to be incurred through 2026. There are risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of these programs, including but not limited to the high cost and uncertainty of conducting clinical trials (particularly with respect to new and/or complex or innovative drugs), obtaining approval by relevant regulatory bodies and our partner s financial condition. Refer to Note 4 Acquisitions and Other Transactions in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for more information. 
 
 Divestitures 
 On October 1, 2023, the Company announced it received an offer for the divestiture of its OTC Business, and entered into definitive agreements to divest its women s healthcare business and, separately, in another transaction, its rights to two women s healthcare products in certain countries, its API business in India and commercialization rights in the Upjohn Distributor Markets. The divestiture of the women s healthcare business was primarily related to our oral and injectable contraceptives and did not include all of our women s healthcare related products; as an example, our Xulane product in the U.S. was excluded. The transaction to divest the Company s rights to two women s healthcare products in certain countries closed in December 2023 (other than in the U.K.), and the divestiture of the women s healthcare business closed in March 2024. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company closed the divestiture of the product rights in the U.K. The divestitures of the commercialization rights in certain of the Upjohn Distributor Markets closed during 2023 and 2024, the divestiture of our API business in India closed in June 2024, and the OTC Transaction closed in July 2024. Refer to Note 5 Divestitures in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for more information. 
 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 On February 28, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to 1.0 billion of the Company s shares of common stock. The Company subsequently announced that on February 26, 2024, its Board of Directors authorized a 1.0 billion increase to the Company s previously announced 1.0 billion share repurchase program. As a result, the Company s share repurchase program now authorizes the repurchase of up to 2.0 billion of the Company s shares of common stock. Such repurchases may be made from time-to-time at the Company s discretion and effected by any means, including but not limited to, open market repurchases, pursuant to plans in accordance with Rules 10b5-1 or 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, privately negotiated transactions (including accelerated stock repurchase programs) or any combination of such methods as the Company deems appropriate. The program does not have an expiration date. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company repurchased approximately 19.2 million shares of common stock at a cost of approximately 250 million, and approximately 21.2 million shares of common stock at a cost of approximately 250 million, respectively, under the program. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had repurchased a total of 500 million in shares under the program. The share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock.

 A detailed discussion of the Company s financial results can be found below in the section titled Results of Operations. As part of this discussion, we also report sales performance using the non-GAAP financial measures of constant currency net sales and total revenues. These measures provide information on the change in net sales and total revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and current period. The comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency sales at the prior year s foreign exchange rates. We routinely evaluate our net sales and total revenues performance at constant currency so that sales results can be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating a period-to-period comparison of our operational activities, and believe that this presentation also provides useful information to investors for the same reason. 
 More information about non-GAAP measures used by the Company as part of this discussion, including adjusted cost of sales, adjusted gross margins, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net earnings, and adjusted EPS (all of which are defined below) can be found in Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.

Total revenues include both net sales and other revenues from third parties. Net sales for the current quarter were 3.74 billion, compared to 3.93 billion for the comparable prior year period, representing a decrease of 195.9 million, or 5 . Other revenues for the current quarter were 13.2 million, compared to 8.0 million for the comparable prior year period. 
 Net sales decreased by approximately 290.7 million or 7 due to the inclusion of net sales in the prior year period related to divestitures that have closed during 2023 and 2024. The decrease in net sales was also partially driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 14.6 million, or less than 1 , primarily reflecting changes in the U.S. Dollar as compared to the currencies of subsidiaries in Japan and countries in Emerging Markets. Additionally, on a constant currency basis, net sales from the remaining business increased by approximately 109.4 million, or 3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. The increase was driven by new product sales, primarily in Developed Markets, of approximately 133.1 million. New product sales include new products launched in 2024 and the carryover impact of new products, including business development, launched within the last twelve months. This increase was partially offset by base business erosion of approximately 23.7 million. 
 
 From time to time, a limited number of our products may represent a significant portion of our net sales, gross profit and net earnings. Generally, this is due to the timing of new product introductions, seasonality, and the amount, if any, of additional competition in the market. Our top ten products in terms of net sales, in the aggregate, represented approximately 36 and 35 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Net sales are derived from our four reporting segments: Developed Markets, Greater China, JANZ, and Emerging Markets.

Table of Contents 

 Developed Markets Segment 
 
 Net sales from Developed Markets decreased by 109.8 million or 5 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the prior year period. Net sales decreased by approximately 184.7 million or 8 due to the inclusion of net sales in the prior year period related to divestitures that have closed during 2023 and 2024. The favorable impact of foreign currency translation was approximately 15.4 million, or less than 1 . Constant currency net sales from the remaining business increased by approximately 59.5 million or 2 when compared to the prior year period. New product sales throughout Developed Markets, combined with the stability of our existing product portfolio, helped to offset the anticipated lower net sales of certain existing products within the U.S., including EpiPen Auto-Injector, as a result of lower pricing due to additional competition and increased utilization within government channels. Net sales within North America totaled approximately 990.6 million and net sales within Europe totaled approximately 1.31 billion. 
 
 Greater China Segment 
 Net sales from Greater China increased by 13.4 million or 2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the prior year period. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation was approximately 1.9 million. Constant currency net sales increased by approximately 15.3 million or 3 when compared to the prior year period, driven by higher volumes of existing products. Divestitures did not have a significant impact on the net sales for the current quarter. 
 JANZ Segment 
 Net sales from JANZ increased by 9.8 million or 3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the prior year period. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation was approximately 9.8 million, or 3 . In addition, net sales decreased by approximately 6.5 million, or 2 , due to the inclusion of net sales in the prior year period related to divestitures that have closed during 2023 and 2024. Constant currency net sales from the remaining business increased by approximately 26.1 million, or 8 , when compared to the prior year period, driven primarily by new product sales in Australia and volume growth of our promoted brands in Japan. This increase was partially offset by lower net sales of existing products mainly driven by lower pricing in Japan as a result of government price reductions and additional competition. 
 Emerging Markets Segment 
 Net sales from Emerging Markets decreased by 109.3 million or 17 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the prior year period. Net sales decreased by approximately 99.5 million, or 15 , due to the inclusion of net sales in the prior year period related to divestitures that have closed during 2023 and 2024. The decrease in net sales was also partially driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 18.3 million, or 3 . Constant currency net sales from the remaining business increased by 8.5 million, or 1 when compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by new products and higher volumes of existing products in certain Latin American, Middle Eastern and Asian countries. 
 
 Cost of Sales and Gross Profit 
 Cost of sales increased from 2.25 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 2.29 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in cost of sales was primarily driven by restructuring related costs for additional anticipated plant closures. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the decrease in net sales, including as a result of the divestitures that have closed during 2023 and 2024 . 
 Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.46 billion and gross margins were 39 . For the three months ended September 30, 2023, gross profit was 1.69 billion and gross margins were 43 . The changes in gross profit and gross margins are primarily related to the impact of the divestitures and the restructuring-related costs discussed above. Adjusted gross margins were approximately 58 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 59 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 ____________ 
 (a) Adjusted gross profit is calculated as total revenues less adjusted cost of sales. Adjusted gross margin is calculated as adjusted gross profit divided by total revenues. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Research Development Expense 
 R D expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 198.4 million, compared to 211.2 million for the comparable prior year period, a decrease of 12.8 million due to the timing of clinical development programs. 
 Selling, General Administrative Expense 
 SG A expense for the current quarter was 1.00 billion, compared to 1.05 billion for the comparable prior year period, a decrease of 50.1 million. The decrease was primarily driven by the impact of the divestitures, including lower acquisition and divestiture-related costs of approximately 21.5 million. 
 
 Litigation Settlements and Other Contingencies, Net 
 The following table includes the losses/(gains) recognized in litigation settlements and other contingencies, net during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, (In millions) 2024 2023 Contingent consideration adjustment 
 26.8 (2.9) Litigation settlements, net 4.7 (23.2) Total litigation settlements and other contingencies, net 31.5 (26.1) 
 Contingent consideration adjustment for the current quarter was primarily driven by a fair value adjustment related to the Idorsia contingent consideration liability. Refer to Note 11 Financial Instruments and Risk Management in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for more information.

 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 145.6 million, compared to 141.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 4.1 million. The increase is primarily due to the non-cash accretion of the contingent consideration liability related to the Idorsia Transaction, partially offset by lower interest expense as a result of debt repayments. 
 Other Income, Net 
 Other income, net includes gains and losses from divestitures of businesses, changes in the fair value of equity securities, extinguishment of debt, foreign exchange, expense (income) related to post-employment benefit plans, TSA income, and interest and dividend income. Other income, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 10.2 million, compared to 92.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The decrease in other income, net was primarily driven by net loss on divestitures of approximately 107.4 million, and by lower TSA income of approximately 19.7 million as the prior year period included TSA income related to the reimbursement for transition services provided to Biocon Biologics. Biocon Biologics had substantially exited all transition services with Viatris as of December 31, 2023. The costs related to the transition services are included in SG A and R D. These decrease were partially offset by a higher net gain of 20.3 million related to the CCPS in Biocon Biologics, higher interest income of 17.3 million, and gain on debt extinguishments of 16.7 million. 
 
 Income Tax Provision 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized an income tax benefit of 4.3 million, compared to an income tax provision of 70.6 million for the comparable prior year period, a change of 74.9 million. The current year and prior year provisions were impacted by the levels of income and the changing mix at which it is earned in jurisdictions with differing tax rates.

 (5) Amounts exclude intersegment revenue which eliminates on a consolidated basis. 
 
 Total Revenues 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Viatris reported total revenues of 11.21 billion, compared to 11.59 billion for the comparable prior year period, representing a decrease of 378.4 million, or 3 . Total revenues include both net sales and other revenues from third parties. Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 11.18 billion, compared to 11.56 billion for the comparable prior year period, representing a decrease of 385.1 million, or 3 . Other revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 33.8 million, compared to 27.1 million for the comparable prior year period. 
 Net sales decreased by approximately 445.4 million or 4 due to the inclusion of net sales in the prior year period related to divestitures that have closed during 2023 and 2024. The decrease in net sales was also partially driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 190.9 million, or 2 , primarily reflecting changes in the U.S. Dollar as compared to the currencies of subsidiaries in Japan, China, and countries in Emerging Markets. Additionally, on a constant currency basis, net sales from the remaining business increased by approximately 251.2 million, or 2 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. The increase was driven by new product sales of approximately 497.2 million, primarily in Developed Markets. New product sales include new products launched in 2024 and the carryover impact of new products, including business development, launched within the last twelve months. This increase was partially offset by base business erosion of approximately 246.0 million. 
 From time to time, a limited number of our products may represent a significant portion of our net sales, gross profit and net earnings. Generally, this is due to the timing of new product introductions, seasonality, and the amount, if any, of additional competition in the market. Our top ten products in terms of net sales, in the aggregate, represented approximately 33 and 34 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Net sales are derived from our four reporting segments: Developed Markets, Greater China, JANZ, and Emerging Markets.

Table of Contents 

Developed Markets Segment 
 Net sales from Developed Markets decreased by 149.4 million or 2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the prior year period. Net sales decreased by approximately 231.3 million or 3 due to the inclusion of net sales in the prior year period related to divestitures that have closed during 2023 and 2024. The favorable impact of foreign currency translation was approximately 13.6 million or essentially flat. Constant currency net sales from the remaining business increased by approximately 68.3 million or 1 when compared to the prior year period. New product sales throughout Developed Markets, including Breyna in the U.S., combined with the stability of our existing product portfolio, helped to offset the anticipated lower net sales of certain existing products within the U.S., including EpiPen Auto-Injector and Perforomist , as a result of lower pricing and volumes due to additional competition and increased utilization within government channels. Net sales within North America totaled approximately 2.87 billion and net sales within Europe totaled approximately 3.91 billion. 
 
 Greater China Segment 
 Net sales from Greater China were essentially flat for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the prior year period. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation was approximately 42.4 million, or 3 . Constant currency net sales increased by approximately 42.0 million or 3 when compared to the prior year period, driven by higher volumes of existing products. Divestitures did not have a significant impact on the net sales for the current year period. 
 JANZ Segment 
 Net sales from JANZ decreased by 40.5 million or 4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the prior year period. This decrease was the result of the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 70.6 million, or 7 . In addition, net sales decreased by approximately 7.1 million, or 1 , due to the inclusion of net sales in the prior year period related to divestitures that have closed during 2023 and 2024. Constant currency net sales from the remaining business increased by approximately 37.2 million, or 4 , when compared to the prior year period, driven primarily by new product sales in Australia and volume growth of our promoted brands in Japan. This increase was partially offset by lower net sales of existing products mainly driven by lower pricing in Japan as a result of government price reductions and additional competition. 
 Emerging Markets Segment 
 Net sales from Emerging Markets decreased by 194.8 million or 10 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the prior year period. Net sales decreased by approximately 207.0 million, or 11 , due to the inclusion of net sales in the prior year period related to divestitures that have closed during 2023 and 2024. The decrease in net sales was also partially driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 91.5 million, or 5 . Constant currency net sales from the remaining business increased by 103.7 million, or 5 when compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by new products and higher volumes of existing products in certain Latin American, Middle Eastern and Asian countries. 
 
 Cost of Sales and Gross Profit 
 Cost of sales increased from 6.75 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 6.80 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in cost of sales was largely driven by an IPR D intangible asset impairment charge of 102.0 million. Refer to Note 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for more information. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the decrease in net sales, including as a result of the divestitures that have closed during 2023 and 2024 . 
 Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 4.41 billion and gross margins were 39 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, gross profit was 4.84 billion and gross margins were 42 . The changes in gross profit and gross margins are primarily related to the impact of the divestitures and the IPR D intangible asset impairment charge. Adjusted gross margins were approximately 58 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 60 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 ____________ 
 (a) Adjusted gross profit is calculated as total revenues less adjusted cost of sales. Adjusted gross margin is calculated as adjusted gross profit divided by total revenues. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Research Development Expense 
 R D expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 602.2 million, compared to 602.4 million for the comparable prior year period, essentially flat. 
 Selling, General Administrative Expense 
 SG A expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.38 billion, compared to 3.04 billion for the comparable prior year period, an increase of 334.6 million. The increase was primarily due to a goodwill impairment charge of 321.0 million related to the JANZ reporting unit, and higher acquisition and divestiture-related costs of approximately 45.2 million. Refer to Note 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for more information on the goodwill impairment charge. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the divestitures. 
 Litigation Settlements and Other Contingencies, Net 
 The following table includes the losses/(gains) recognized in litigation settlements and other contingencies, net during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively:

 28.4 12.7 Litigation settlements, net 210.9 (49.2) Total litigation settlements and other contingencies, net 239.3 (36.5) 
 Contingent consideration adjustment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by a fair value adjustment related to the Idorsia contingent consideration liability. Refer to Note 11 Financial Instruments and Risk Management in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for more information.

 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 429.8 million, compared to 432.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 2.4 million. The decrease is primarily due to the impact of debt repayments, partially offset by the non-cash accretion of the contingent consideration liability related to the Idorsia Transaction. 
 Other Income, Net 
 Other income, net includes gains and losses from divestitures of businesses, changes in the fair value of equity securities, extinguishment of debt, foreign exchange, expense (income) related to post-employment benefit plans, TSA income, and interest and dividend income. Other income, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 143.2 million, compared to 269.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The decrease in other income, net was primarily driven by a net loss on divestitures of approximately 295.8 million, and by lower TSA income of approximately 92.8 million as the prior year period included TSA income related to the reimbursement for transition services provided to Biocon Biologics. Biocon Biologics had substantially exited all transition services with Viatris as of December 31, 2023. The costs related to the transition services are included in SG A and R D. This decrease was partially offset by higher net gains of 220.8 million related to our non-marketable equity investments, including the CCPS in Biocon Biologics, higher interest income of 39.8 million, and gain on debt extinguishments of 16.7 million. 
 
 Income Tax Provision 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized an income tax provision of 21.0 million, compared to 237.6 million for the comparable prior year period, a decrease of 216.6 million. The current year income tax provision was negatively impacted due to the goodwill impairment charge recorded in the second quarter of 2024, for which no tax benefit was realized. This was partially offset by a benefit related to the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions as a result of the favorable court decision in the Australian tax matter, and certain statute of limitations expirations. The current year and prior year provisions were also impacted by the levels of income and the changing mix at which it is earned in jurisdictions with differing tax rates. Further impacting the tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was a tax expense of 22.3 million related to an agreement with the Indian tax authorities in March 2023 in respect of the pricing of its international transactions. 

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Whenever the Company uses non-GAAP financial measures, we provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. Investors and other readers are encouraged to review the related U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure and should consider non-GAAP measures only as a supplement to, not as a substitute for or as a superior measure to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Additionally, since these are not measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning across companies, or as prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures or measures with the same title used by other companies. 
 Management uses these measures internally for forecasting, budgeting, measuring its operating performance, and incentive-based awards. Primarily due to acquisitions, divestitures and other significant events which may impact comparability of our periodic operating results, we believe that an evaluation of our ongoing operations (and comparisons of our current operations with historical and future operations) would be difficult if the disclosure of our financial results was limited to financial measures prepared only in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures are useful supplemental information for our investors and when considered together with our U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our operations. The financial performance of the Company is measured by senior management, in part, using adjusted metrics as described below, along with other performance metrics. The Company s use of such non-GAAP measures is governed by an adjusted reporting policy maintained by the Company and such non-GAAP measures are reviewed in detail with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 
 65 

Table of Contents 

 Adjusted Cost of Sales and Adjusted Gross Margin 
 We use the non-GAAP financial measure adjusted cost of sales and the corresponding non-GAAP financial measure adjusted gross margin. The principal items excluded from adjusted cost of sales include restructuring, acquisition and divestiture-related costs, and other special items, purchase accounting amortization and other related items, and share-based compensation expense, which are described in greater detail below. 
 Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted EPS 
 Adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures and provide an alternative view of performance used by management. Management believes that, primarily due to acquisitions, divestitures and other significant events, an evaluation of the Company s ongoing operations (and comparisons of its current operations with historical and future operations) would be difficult if the disclosure of its financial results were limited to financial measures prepared only in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management believes that adjusted net earnings and adjusted EPS are important internal financial metrics related to the ongoing operating performance of the Company, and are therefore useful to investors and that their understanding of our performance is enhanced by these measures. Actual internal and forecasted operating results and annual budgets used by management include adjusted net earnings and adjusted EPS. 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures that the Company believes are appropriate to provide additional information to investors to demonstrate the Company s ability to comply with financial debt covenants and assess the Company s ability to incur additional indebtedness. The Company also believes that adjusted EBITDA better focuses management on the Company s underlying operational results and true business performance and is used, in part, for management s incentive compensation. We calculate EBITDA as U.S. GAAP net earnings (loss) adjusted for income tax provision (benefit), interest expense and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is further adjusted for share-based compensation expense, litigation settlements and other contingencies, net, gain on divestitures of businesses, restructuring related costs, impairment of long-lived assets, acquisition and divestiture-related and other special items to determine adjusted EBITDA. These adjustments are generally permitted under our credit agreement in calculating adjusted EBITDA for determining compliance with our debt covenants. 
 The significant items excluded from adjusted cost of sales, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net earnings, and adjusted EPS include: 
 Purchase Accounting Amortization and Other Related Items 
 The ongoing impact of certain amounts recorded in connection with acquisitions of both businesses and assets is excluded from adjusted cost of sales, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net earnings, and adjusted EPS. These amounts include the amortization of intangible assets, inventory step-up, property, plant and equipment step-up, intangible asset impairment charges, including for IPR D, and impairment of goodwill. For the acquisition of businesses accounted for under the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations , these purchase accounting impacts are excluded regardless of the financing method used for the acquisitions, including the use of cash, long-term debt, the issuance of common stock, contingent consideration or any combination thereof. 
 Fair Value Adjustments, Including Contingent Consideration 
 The impact of changes to the fair value of assets and liabilities, including contingent and deferred consideration and non-marketable equity investments, and the related accretion income or expense are excluded from adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net earnings, and adjusted EPS because they are not indicative of the Company s ongoing operations due to the variability of the amounts and the lack of predictability as to the occurrence and/or timing and management believes their exclusion is helpful to understanding the underlying, ongoing operational performance of the business. 
 66 

Table of Contents 

 Share-based Compensation Expense 
 Share-based compensation expense is excluded from adjusted cost of sales, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net earnings, and adjusted EPS. Our share-based compensation programs have become increasingly weighted toward performance-based compensation, which leads to variability and to a lack of predictability as to the occurrence and/or timing of amounts incurred. As such, management believes the exclusion of such amounts on an ongoing basis is helpful to understanding the underlying operational performance of the business. 
 Restructuring, Acquisition and Divestiture-Related Costs and Other Special Items 
 Costs related to restructuring, acquisition and divestiture-related activities and other actions are excluded from adjusted cost of sales, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net earnings, and adjusted EPS, as applicable. These amounts include items such as: 
 Costs related to formal restructuring programs and actions, including costs associated with facilities to be closed or divested, employee separation costs, impairment charges, accelerated depreciation, incremental manufacturing variances, equipment relocation costs, decommissioning and other restructuring related costs; 
 Certain acquisition and divestiture costs, including costs relating to integration and planning, advisory and legal fees, certain financing related costs, certain reimbursements related to the Company s obligation to reimburse Pfizer for certain financing and transaction related costs under the Business Combination Agreement and Separation and Distribution Agreement, certain other TSA related set-up and exit costs, and other business transformation and/or optimization initiatives, which are not part of a formal restructuring program, including employee separation and post-employment costs; 
 Other costs, incurred from time to time, related to certain special events or activities that lead to gains or losses, including, but not limited to, incremental manufacturing variances, asset write-downs, including other-than-temporary impairments of investments in equity or debt instruments, or liability adjustments; 
 Certain costs to further develop and optimize our global enterprise resource planning systems, operations and supply chain; 
 Gains or losses from divestitures, including impairments of held for sale assets; and 
 The impact of changes related to uncertain tax positions are excluded from adjusted net earnings, and adjusted EPS. In addition, tax adjustments to adjusted earnings are recorded to present items on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of adjusted net earnings and adjusted EPS. 
 
 The Company has undertaken restructurings and other optimization initiatives of differing types, scope and amount during the covered periods and, therefore, these charges should not be considered non-recurring; however, management excludes these amounts from adjusted cost of sales, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net earnings, and adjusted EPS because it believes it is helpful to understanding the underlying, ongoing operational performance of the business. 
 Litigation Settlements, Net 
 Charges and gains related to legal matters, such as those discussed in Note 17 Litigation included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q are generally excluded from adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net earnings, and adjusted EPS.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary source of liquidity is net cash provided by operating activities, which was 1.82 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We believe that net cash provided by operating activities and available liquidity will continue to allow us to meet our needs for working capital, capital expenditures, interest and principal payments on debt obligations, dividend payments, and share repurchases. Nevertheless, our ability to satisfy our working capital requirements and debt service obligations, and fund planned capital expenditures, share repurchases, or dividend payments, will substantially depend upon our future operating performance (which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions), and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. 
 Beginning in 2024, upfront and milestone payments related to externally developed IPR D projects acquired directly in a transaction other than a business combination, which were previously included in cash flows from operating activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, are now classified as cash flows from investing activities. Certain reclassifications were made to conform the prior period condensed consolidated financial statements to the current period presentation. The adjustments resulted in an increase to net cash provided by operating activities and an increase to net cash used in investing activities of 11.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 511.3 million to 1.82 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 2.33 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash provided by operating activities is derived from net earnings (loss) adjusted for non-cash operating items, gains and losses attributed to investing and financing activities and changes in operating assets and liabilities resulting from timing differences between the receipts and payments of cash, including changes in cash primarily reflecting the timing of cash collections from customers, payments to vendors and employees and tax payments in the ordinary course of business.

Table of Contents 

 The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was principally due to lower operating earnings, including as a result of divestitures in 2023 and 2024, higher transaction costs associated with the divestitures, and the timing of cash payments and collections. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash from investing activities was 1.97 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of 891.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 2.86 billion. 
 In 2024, significant items in investing activities included the following: 
 proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses of 2.51 billion primarily related to the divestitures of the OTC Business, the API business in India and the women s healthcare business; 
 cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of 350.0 million related to the Idorsia Transaction; and 
 capital expenditures, primarily for equipment and facilities, totaling approximately 185.6 million. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, capital expenditures for the 2024 calendar year are expected to be approximately 350 million to 450 million. 
 In 2023, significant items in investing activities included the following: 
 cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of 667.7 million; and 
 capital expenditures, primarily for equipment and facilities, totaling approximately 211.5 million. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 2.91 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.38 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 1.53 billion. 
 In 2024, significant items in financing activities included the following: 
 repayment of Senior Notes of approximately 1.54 billion; 
 repayment of the 1.023 Euro Senior Notes at maturity of approximately 801.7 million; 
 share repurchases of 250.0 million; 
 cash dividends paid of 431.5 million; and 
 receipt of 100.0 million in deferred consideration from the Biocon Biologics Transaction, and net cash of 97.2 million collected on behalf of various partners, including Biocon Biologics, which are included in Other items, net. 
 In 2023, significant items in financing activities included the following: 
 repayment of the 3.125 Senior Notes at maturity of approximately 750.0 million; 
 share repurchases of 250.0 million; 
 cash dividends paid of 431.6 million; and 
 net cash of 104.6 million collected on behalf of various partners, including Biocon Biologics, which is included in Other items, net.

 Capital Resources 
 Our cash and cash equivalents totaled 1.88 billion at September 30, 2024. The majority of our cash is invested in U.S. government money market funds and in bank deposits. In order to support our global operations, we maintain significant cash and cash equivalents within the banking system with the majority of this at Global Systemically Important Banks. We monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a regular basis. Our primary emphasis is on the safety of the principal. Where possible, we diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one counterparty. The Company anticipates having sufficient liquidity, including existing borrowing capacity under the 2024 Revolving Facility, Commercial Paper Program, and Receivables Facility combined with cash to be generated from operations, to fund foreseeable cash needs without requiring the repatriation of non-U.S. cash. 
 
 The Company has access to 3.5 billion under the 2024 Revolving Facility which matures in September 2029. Up to 1.65 billion of the 2024 Revolving Facility may be used to support borrowings under our Commercial Paper Program. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program or the 2024 Revolving Facility. 
 The Company has a 400 million Receivables Facility which expires in April 2025. The Company also had a 200 million Note Securitization Facility which expired in August 2024 and was not renewed. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any borrowings outstanding under the Receivables Facility. 
 Under the terms of the Receivables Facility, certain of our accounts receivable secure the amounts borrowed and cannot be used to pay our other debts or liabilities. The amount that we may borrow at a given point in time is determined based on the amount of qualifying accounts receivable that are present at such point in time. Borrowings outstanding under the Receivables Facility bear interest at the applicable base rate plus 0.775 and are included as a component of short-term borrowings, while the accounts receivable securing these obligations remain as a component of accounts receivable, net, in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the agreement governing the Receivables Facility contains various customary affirmative and negative covenants, and customary default and termination provisions. 
 We have entered into accounts receivable factoring agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our non-U.S. accounts receivable. These transactions are accounted for as sales and result in a reduction in accounts receivable because the agreements transfer effective control over and risk related to the receivables to the buyers. Our factoring agreements do not allow for recourse in the event of uncollectibility, and we do not retain any interest in the underlying accounts receivable once sold. We derecognized 19.9 million and 30.8 million of accounts receivable as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 under these factoring arrangements, respectively. Additionally, in 2023, we entered into a similar arrangement for certain European countries. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we have assigned and derecognized approximately 357.0 million and 415.7 million, respectively, of Trade Receivables, Net , which are now included in Other Receivables . 
 For information regarding our dividends paid and declared and share repurchase program, refer to Note 9 Earnings (Loss) per Share in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
 We are continuously evaluating the potential acquisition of products, as well as companies, as a strategic part of our future growth. Consequently, we may utilize current cash reserves or incur additional indebtedness to finance any such acquisitions, which could impact future liquidity. Also, on an ongoing basis, we review our operations, including the evaluation of potential divestitures of products and businesses, as part of our future strategy. Any divestitures could impact future liquidity. In addition, we plan to continue to explore various other ways to create, enhance or otherwise unlock the value of the Company s unique global platform in order to create shareholder value.

 Other Commitments 
 The Company is involved in various disputes, governmental and/or regulatory inquiries, investigations and proceedings, tax proceedings and litigation matters, both in the U.S. and abroad, that arise from time to time, some of which could result in losses, including damages, fines and/or civil penalties, and/or criminal charges against the Company. These matters are often complex and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. We have approximately 371.1 million accrued for legal contingencies at September 30, 2024. 
 While the Company believes that it has meritorious defenses with respect to the claims asserted against it and the assumed legal matters referenced above, and intends to vigorously defend its position, the process of resolving these matters is inherently uncertain and may develop over a long period of time, and so it is not possible to predict the ultimate resolution of any such matter. It is possible that an unfavorable resolution of any of the ongoing matters could have a material effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, ability to pay dividends and/or stock price.

 Application of Critical Accounting Policies 
 The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually on April 1st or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. The Company performed the annual goodwill impairment test as of April 1, 2024. 
 The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test on a quantitative basis for its five reporting units, North America, Europe, Emerging Markets, JANZ, and Greater China. In estimating each reporting unit s fair value, the Company performed an extensive valuation analysis, utilizing a discounted cash flow approach. The determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reporting unit s expected future cash flows. These estimates and assumptions, utilizing Level 3 inputs, primarily include, but are not limited to, the discount rate, terminal growth rates, operating income before depreciation and amortization, capital expenditures forecasts and control premiums. 
 
 When compared to the prior year s annual goodwill impairment test completed on April 1, 2023, due to certain macroeconomic conditions, the Company has experienced fluctuations in foreign exchange rates in certain international markets, combined with an increase in market interest rates. These conditions impacted all reporting units, with the most significant impact in JANZ and Emerging Markets. The impact in the other reporting units was offset by changes in other discount rate assumptions. 
 
 As of April 1, 2024, the allocation of the Company s total goodwill was as follows: North America 3.12 billion, Europe 3.86 billion, Emerging Markets 1.17 billion, JANZ 0.62 billion and Greater China 0.93 billion. 
 In conjunction with its annual goodwill impairment test, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 321.0 million during the second quarter of 2024 related to its JANZ reporting unit, which was recorded within SG A in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The impairment charge was primarily the result of a 1.0 increase in the discount rate and a 0.5 reduction in the terminal growth rate assumption for the reporting unit. 
 For the JANZ reporting unit at April 1, 2024, the Company forecasted cash flows for the next 10 years. During the forecast period, the revenue compound annual growth rate was approximately negative 0.3 . A terminal year value was calculated with a 1.0 revenue growth rate applied. The discount rate utilized was 8.0 and the estimated tax rate was 30.3 . 
 Following the goodwill impairment charge recorded in the JANZ reporting unit, the carrying value of the reporting unit was equal to its estimated fair value as of April 1, 2024. If market conditions or the projected results were to change materially, it may be necessary to record further impairment charges to the JANZ reporting unit in future periods. 
 As of April 1, 2024, the Company determined that the fair values of the North America, Greater China, and Emerging Markets reporting units were substantially in excess of the respective unit s carrying value. 
 For the Europe reporting unit, the estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 882 million or 7.9 for the annual goodwill impairment test. As it relates to the discounted cash flow approach for the Europe reporting unit at April 1, 2024, the Company forecasted cash flows for the next 10 years. During the forecast period, the revenue compound annual growth rate was approximately 2.5 . A terminal year value was calculated with a 2.0 revenue growth rate applied. The discount rate utilized was 10.0 and the estimated tax rate was 15.7 . If all other assumptions are held constant, a reduction in the terminal value growth rate by 1.5 or an increase in discount rate by 1.0 would result in an impairment charge for the Europe reporting unit.

 Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. In addition, changes in underlying assumptions, especially as they relate to the key assumptions detailed, could have a significant impact on the fair value of the reporting units.
