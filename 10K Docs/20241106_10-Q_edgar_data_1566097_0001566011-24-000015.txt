CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This combined Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements of expected future developments that involve risks and uncertainties. You can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as believes, expects, may, should, seeks, approximately, intends, plans, estimates, anticipates or similar expressions that relate to our strategy, plans, or intentions. All statements we make relating to our estimated and projected earnings, margins, costs, expenditures, cash flows, growth rates and financial results or to our strategies, objectives, intentions, resources, and expectations regarding future industry trends are forward-looking statements. In addition, we, through our senior management, from time to time make forward-looking public statements concerning our expected future operations and performance and other developments. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may change at any time, and, therefore, our actual results may differ materially from those that we expected. We derive many of our forward-looking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts, which are based on many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and, of course, it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. 
 Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, which we refer to as cautionary statements, are disclosed under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 of PBF Holding and PBF Finance, which we refer to as our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in our other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). All forward-looking information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements. Some of the factors that we believe could affect our results include: 
 supply, demand, prices and other market conditions for our products or crude oil, including volatility in commodity prices or constraints arising from federal, state, or local governmental actions or environmental and/or social activists that reduce crude oil production or availability in the regions in which we operate our pipelines and facilities; 
 rate of inflation and its impact on supply and demand, pricing, and supply chain disruption; 
 the effects related to, or resulting from, geopolitical conflict around the world, including Russia s military action in Ukraine, ongoing armed hostilities in the middle east and disruptions in international shipping, resulting from ongoing attacks by armed groups on cargo ships in the Red Sea, including the imposition of additional sanctions and export controls, the potential expansion of such conflicts to other nations or regions, as well as the broader impacts to financial markets and the global macroeconomic and geopolitical environment; 
 the effectiveness of our crude oil sourcing strategies, including our crude by rail strategy and related commitments; 
 our obligation to buy Renewable Identification Numbers RINs and market risks related to the volatility in the price of RINs required to comply with the Renewable Fuel Standard RFS and greenhouse gas GHG emission credits required to comply with various GHG emission programs, such as California Assembly Bill 32 AB 32 
 our ability to operate our businesses efficiently, manage capital expenditures and costs (including general and administrative expenses) and generate earnings and cash flow; 
 our expectations with respect to our capital spending and turnaround projects; 
 3 

the impact of current and future laws, rulings, and governmental regulations, including restrictions on the exploration and/or production of crude oil in the state of California, the implementation of rules and regulations regarding transportation of crude oil by rail or in response to the potential impacts of climate change, decarbonization and future energy transition and public policy in opposition to recent refining industry profits; 
 adverse impacts related to legislation by the federal government lifting the restrictions on exporting U.S. crude oil or subjecting us to trade and sanctions laws, which change frequently as a result of foreign policy developments, and which may necessitate changes to our crude oil acquisition activities; 
 our ability to manage our costs and expenses; 
 political pressure and influence of environmental groups and other stakeholders on decisions and policies related to the refining, processing and storage of crude oil and refined products, and the related adverse impacts from changes in our regulatory environment, such as the effects of compliance with AB 32 and/or California Assembly Bill ABX2-1, or from actions taken by environmental interest groups; 
 the risk of cyber-attacks; 
 our increased dependence on technology; 
 the effects of competition in our markets; 
 our ability to make acquisitions or investments, including in renewable diesel production, and to realize the benefits from such acquisitions or investments; 
 liabilities arising from recent acquisitions or investments, that are unforeseen or exceed our expectations; 
 our expectations and timing with respect to our acquisition and investment activity; 
 adverse developments in our relationship with both our key employees and unionized employees; 
 our indebtedness, including the impact of potential downgrades to our corporate credit rating and/or unsecured notes; 
 changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and capital costs; 
 restrictive covenants in our indebtedness that may adversely affect our operational flexibility; 
 counterparty credit and performance risk exposure related to our supply and inventory intermediation arrangements, if any; 
 our assumptions regarding payments arising under PBF Energy s tax receivable agreement entered with the PBF LLC Series A and PBF LLC Series B unitholders and other arrangements relating to PBF Energy; 
 the impact of disruptions to crude or feedstock supply to any of our refineries, including disruptions related to PBFX or with third-party logistics infrastructure or operations, including pipeline, marine and rail transportation; and 
 any decisions we continue to make with respect to our energy-related logistics assets that may be transferred to PBFX. 
 We caution you that the foregoing list of important factors may not contain all of the material factors that are important to you. In addition, in light of these risks and uncertainties, the matters referred to in the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may not in fact occur. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on those statements. 
 Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update or revise any forward-looking statements. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing.

 Feedstocks and other Asphalt and blackoils Chemicals Lubricants Total Revenues Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 Gasoline and distillates Asphalt and blackoils Feedstocks and other Chemicals Lubricants Total Revenues 
 The Company s revenues are generated from the sale of refined products. These revenues are largely based on the current spot (market) prices of the products sold, which represent consideration specifically allocable to the products being sold on a given day, and the Company recognizes those revenues upon delivery and transfer of title to the products to the Company s customers. The time at which delivery and transfer of title occurs is the point when the Company s control of the products is transferred to the Company s customers and when its performance obligation to its customers is fulfilled. Delivery and transfer of title are specifically agreed to between the Company and customers within the contracts. The Company also has contracts which contain fixed pricing, tiered pricing, minimum volume features with makeup periods, or other factors that have not materially been affected by Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. 
 Deferred Revenue 
 The Company records deferred revenue when cash payments are received or are due in advance of performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenue was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Fluctuations in the deferred revenue balance are primarily driven by the timing and extent of cash payments received or due in advance of satisfying the Company s performance obligations. 
 The Company s payment terms vary by type and location of customers and the products offered. The period between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant (i.e. generally within two months). For certain products or services and customer types, the Company requires payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer.

The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. We caution that assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions, or beliefs about future events may, and often do, vary from actual results and the differences can be material. Please see Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. 
 Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms we, us, and our refer to PBF Holding and its consolidated subsidiaries. 

Overview 
 We are one of the largest independent petroleum refiners and suppliers of unbranded transportation fuels, heating oil, petrochemical feedstocks, lubricants, and other petroleum products in the United States. We sell our products throughout the Northeast, Midwest, Gulf Coast and West Coast of the United States, as well as in other regions of the United States, Canada and Mexico and are able to ship products to other international destinations. We own and operate six domestic oil refineries and related assets. Our refineries have a combined processing capacity, known as throughput, of approximately 1,000,000 barrels per day bpd ), and a weighted-average Nelson Complexity Index of 12.7 based on current operating conditions. The complexity and throughput capacity of our refineries are subject to change dependent upon configuration changes we make to respond to market conditions, as well as a result of investments made to improve our facilities and maintain compliance with environmental and governmental regulations. Our six oil refineries are aggregated into one reportable segment. 
 Our six refineries are located in Delaware City, Delaware, Paulsboro, New Jersey, Toledo, Ohio, Chalmette, Louisiana, Torrance, California and Martinez, California. Each refinery is briefly described in the table below:

(1) Reflects operating conditions at each refinery as of the date of this filing. Changes in complexity and throughput capacity reflect the result of current market conditions, in addition to investments made to improve our facilities and maintain compliance with environmental and governmental regulations. Configurations at each of our refineries are evaluated periodically and updated accordingly. 
 (2) Reflects the typical crude and feedstocks and related sources utilized under normal operating conditions and prevailing market environments. 
 (3) Under normal operating conditions and prevailing market environments, our Nelson Complexity Index and throughput capacity for the Paulsboro refinery would be 13.1 and 180,000, respectively. As a result of the reconfiguration of our East Coast refineries in 2020, and subsequent restart of several idled processing units at the Paulsboro refinery in 2022, our Nelson Complexity Index and throughput capacity were adjusted. 
 We are a wholly-owned subsidiary of PBF LLC and an indirect subsidiary of PBF Energy. PBF Finance is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PBF Holding. We are the parent company for PBF LLC s refinery operating subsidiaries. 
 PBF Logistics LP Transactions 
 PBFX GP serves as the general partner of PBFX. PBFX is an affiliate of ours. PBFX, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of PBF Energy and PBF LLC, owns or leases, operates, develops, and acquires crude oil and refined products terminals, pipelines, storage facilities and similar logistics assets. PBFX engages in the receiving, handling, storage and transferring of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, and intermediates from sources located throughout the United States and Canada for PBF Energy in support of its refineries, as well as for third-party customers.

Factors Affecting Comparability Between Periods 
 Our results have been affected by the following events, the understanding of which will aid in assessing the comparability of our period to period financial performance and financial condition. 
 Debt and Credit Facilities 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 On August 23, 2023, we entered into an amendment and restatement of our existing asset-based revolving credit agreement (the Revolving Credit Agreement ). The Revolving Credit Agreement amended and restated the previously existing revolving credit agreement dated as of May 2, 2018 (as amended from time to time, the Prior Credit Agreement ). Among other things, the Revolving Credit Agreement extended our asset-based revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility through August 2028 and increased the maximum commitment to 3.5 billion from 2.85 billion. The commitment fees on the unused portion, the interest rate on advances and the fees for letters of credit are generally consistent with the Prior Credit Agreement. 
 Senior Notes 
 On August 21, 2023, we issued 500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.875 senior unsecured notes due 2030 (the 2030 Senior Notes ). The net proceeds from this offering were approximately 488.8 million after deducting the initial purchasers discount and estimated offering expenses. We used the net proceeds, together with cash on hand, to fully redeem the outstanding 7.25 senior unsecured notes due 2025 (the 2025 Senior Notes ), including accrued and unpaid interest, on September 13, 2023 for approximately 664.5 million. 
 Catalyst Financing Obligations 
 During 2023, we settled our last remaining precious metal financing arrangement, which represented a reduction of debt of approximately 3.1 million. 
 Inventory Intermediation Agreement 
 Prior to 2023, PBF Holding and its subsidiaries, Delaware City Refining Company LLC DCR ), Paulsboro Refining Company LLC PRC ), and Chalmette Refining LLC Chalmette Refining (collectively, the PBF Entities ), entered into the third amended and restated inventory intermediation agreement (the Third Inventory Intermediation Agreement with J. Aron Company, a subsidiary of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. J. Aron ). Pursuant to the Third Inventory Intermediation Agreement, J. Aron purchased and held title to certain crude oil, intermediates, and finished products (the J. Aron Products purchased or produced by the Paulsboro and Delaware City refineries (and at the election of the PBF Entities, the Chalmette refinery) (the Refineries and delivered into the storage tanks at the Refineries (the Storage Tanks ). The J. Aron Products were sold back to us as the J. Aron Products were discharged out of the Storage Tanks. 
 On June 28, 2023, the PBF Entities entered into a second amendment to the Third Inventory Intermediation Agreement to amend certain provisions in order to allow for the early termination of the Third Inventory Intermediation Agreement effective as of July 31, 2023. In conjunction with this early termination, we made a payment of 268.0 million for the inventory previously held by J. Aron, inclusive of 13.5 million of related costs associated with exiting the agreement.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Overview Net loss was 427.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net income of 995.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Our results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were negatively impacted by a special item consisting of a non-cash, pre-tax lower of cost or market LCM inventory adjustment of approximately 154.5 million. Our results for the three months ended September 30, 2023 were negatively impacted by special items consisting of a change in fair value of our earn-out obligation associated with the acquisition of the Martinez refinery and logistics assets (the Martinez Contingent Consideration of 65.3 million, a loss on extinguishment of debt related to the redemption of the 2025 Senior Notes and the amendment and restatement of the Revolving Credit Facility of 5.7 million, and exit costs associated with the early termination of the Third Inventory Intermediation Agreement of 13.5 million. 
 34 

Excluding the impact of these special items, when comparing our results to the three months ended September 30, 2023, we experienced an overall decrease in our refining margins due to unfavorable movements in crack spreads and certain crude oil differentials and lower throughput volumes and barrels sold. These decreasing metrics have negatively impacted our revenues, gross margin, and operating income in comparison to the same period in 2023. 
 Revenues Revenues totaled 8.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 10.7 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately 2.3 billion, or 21.5 . Revenues per barrel were 89.09 and 111.61 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 20.2 directly related to lower hydrocarbon commodity prices. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the total throughput rates at our East Coast, Mid-Continent, Gulf Coast, and West Coast refineries averaged approximately 307,200 bpd, 160,000 bpd, 164,600 bpd and 303,800 bpd, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the total throughput rates at our East Coast, Mid-Continent, Gulf Coast, and West Coast refineries averaged approximately 318,600 bpd, 152,600 bpd, 184,300 bpd and 284,200 bpd, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the total barrels sold at our East Coast, Mid-Continent, Gulf Coast, and West Coast refineries averaged approximately 342,200 bpd, 163,000 bpd, 160,100 bpd and 356,200 bpd, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the total barrels sold at our East Coast, Mid-Continent, Gulf Coast, and West Coast refineries averaged approximately 346,700 bpd, 160,000 bpd, 193,700 bpd and 344,100 bpd, respectively. 
 Overall average throughput rates at our refineries remained consistent in the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. We plan to continue operating our refineries based on demand and current market conditions. Total refined product barrels sold were higher than throughput rates, reflecting sales from inventory as well as sales and purchases of refined products outside our refineries. 
 Consolidated gross margin Consolidated gross margin totaled (341.3) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,176.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately 1,517.4 million. Gross refining margin totaled 429.6 million, or 5.00 per barrel of throughput for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,923.1 million, or 22.24 per barrel of throughput for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately 1,493.5 million. Gross refining margin excluding special items totaled 584.1 million, or 6.79 per barrel of throughput for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,923.1 million, or 22.24 per barrel of throughput for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 1,339.0 million. 
 Consolidated gross margin and gross refining margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were negatively impacted by a non-cash LCM adjustment of approximately 154.5 million resulting from the decrease in crude oil and refined product prices from the second quarter of 2024 to the end of the third quarter of 2024. Gross refining margin excluding special items decreased due to unfavorable movements in crack spreads and certain crude oil differentials and barrels sold at the majority of our refineries. Consolidated gross margin and gross refining margin were not impacted by special items during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Additionally, our results continue to be impacted by significant costs to comply with the RFS. Total RFS compliance costs were 128.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 167.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Average industry margins were unfavorable during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to decreased refining margins as a result of unfavorable supply and demand dynamics that impacted crack spreads. 
 Favorable movements in benchmark crude differentials typically result in lower crude costs and positively impact our earnings while reductions in these benchmark crude differentials typically result in higher crude costs and negatively impact our earnings. 
 35 

On the East Coast, the Dated Brent (NYH) 2-1-1 industry crack spread was approximately 16.22 per barrel, or 54.3 lower, in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 35.49 per barrel in the same period in 2023. Our margins were positively impacted from our refinery specific slate on the East Coast by strengthened WTI/Bakken differential, which increased by 2.85 per barrel, partially offset by a weakened Dated Brent/Maya differential, which decreased by 1.50 per barrel in comparison to the same period in 2023. The WTI/WCS differential decreased to 15.31 per barrel in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 17.13 in the same period in 2023, which unfavorably impacted our cost of heavy Canadian crude. 
 Across the Mid-Continent, the WTI (Chicago) 4-3-1 industry crack spread was 17.47 per barrel, or 33.1 lower, in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 26.12 per barrel in the same period in 2023. Our margins were positively impacted from our refinery specific slate in the Mid-Continent by strengthened WTI/Bakken and WTI/Syncrude differentials, which increased by 2.85 and 1.99 per barrel, respectively, in comparison to the same period in 2023. 
 On the Gulf Coast, the LLS (Gulf Coast) 2-1-1 industry crack spread was 16.02 per barrel, or 55.7 lower, in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 36.19 per barrel in the same period in 2023. Margins on the Gulf Coast were positively impacted from our refinery specific slate by a strengthened WTI/LLS differential, which averaged a premium of 2.10 per barrel for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a premium of 2.38 per barrel in the same period of 2023. 
 On the West Coast the ANS (West Coast) 4-3-1 industry crack spread was 19.27 per barrel, or 61.6 lower, in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 50.22 per barrel in the same period in 2023. Additionally, the ANS (West Coast) 3-2-1 industry crack spread was 22.94 per barrel, or 53.1 lower, in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 48.88 per barrel in the same period in 2023. Our margins on the West Coast were positively impacted from our refinery specific slate by strengthened WTI/ANS differential, which averaged a premium of 3.67 per barrel for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a premium of 5.41 per barrel in the same period of 2023. 
 Operating expenses Operating expenses totaled 621.4 million, or 7.22 per barrel of throughput, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 615.8 million, or 7.12 per barrel of throughput, for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 5.6 million, or 0.9 . The increase in operating expenses when compared to the same period in 2023 was mainly attributable to higher maintenance costs and outside service costs across our refineries, partially offset by lower energy costs due to an overall decrease in natural gas prices. 
 General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses totaled 63.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 90.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately 27.0 million or 29.9 . The decrease in general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 in comparison to the three months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily related to lower employee-related expenses, including incentive compensation. Our general and administrative expenses are comprised of personnel, facilities, and other infrastructure costs necessary to support our refineries. 
 Loss on sale of assets There was a loss of 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 related primarily to the sale of non-operating refinery assets. There was no such gain or loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense Depreciation and amortization expense totaled 151.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (including 149.5 million recorded within Cost of sales) compared to 133.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 (including 131.2 million recorded within Cost of sales), an increase of 17.8 million. The increase was a result of a general increase in our fixed asset base due to capital projects and turnarounds completed since the third quarter of 2023. 
 36 

Change in fair value of contingent consideration Change in fair value of contingent consideration represented a loss of 65.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 related to changes in the estimated fair value of the Martinez Contingent Consideration. Our final earn-out payment of 18.8 million was paid in full during the second quarter of 2024. 
 Change in fair value of catalyst obligations Change in fair value of catalyst obligations represented a loss of 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This loss related to the change in fair value of the precious metals underlying the sale and leaseback of our refineries precious metal catalysts, which we were obligated to repurchase at fair market value upon lease termination. During September 2023, we settled our remaining outstanding precious metal financing arrangement. 
 Loss on extinguishment of debt There was a loss on the extinguishment of debt of 5.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, related to the redemption of the 2025 Senior Notes and the amendment and restatement of the Revolving Credit Agreement. There was no such loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Interest expense, net Interest expense, net totaled 19.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 23.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately 4.9 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense includes interest on long-term debt, letter of credit fees associated with the purchase of certain crude oils and the amortization of deferred financing costs. 
 Income tax expense (benefit) As PBF Holding is a limited liability company treated as a flow-through entity for income tax purposes, our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements generally do not include a benefit or expense for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, apart from the income tax attributable to two subsidiaries acquired in connection with the Chalmette refinery in the fourth quarter of 2015 and PBF Energy Limited PBF Ltd. ). These subsidiaries are treated as C-Corporations for income tax purposes. An income tax expense of 2.9 million was recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024 in comparison to an income tax benefit of 6.4 million recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Overview Net loss was 452.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net income of 1,819.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Our results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were negatively impacted by special items consisting of a non-cash, pre-tax LCM inventory adjustment of approximately 154.5 million and a change in fair value of the Martinez Contingent Consideration of 3.3 million. Our results for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were negatively impacted by special items consisting of a change in fair value of the Martinez Contingent Consideration of 32.4 million, a 5.7 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the redemption of the 2025 Senior Notes and the amendment and restatement of the Revolving Credit Facility, and exit costs associated with the early termination of the Third Inventory Intermediation Agreement of 13.5 million, partially offset by a gain on the sale of a parcel of land at our Torrance refinery of 1.7 million. 
 Excluding the impact of these special items, when comparing our results to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we experienced an overall decrease in our refining margins due to unfavorable movements in crack spreads and crude oil differentials and lower barrels sold at the majority of our refineries. In addition, the planned and unplanned maintenance experienced at our West Coast refineries during the fourth quarter of 2023 extended into the first half of 2024. These decreasing metrics combined with the timing of our maintenance activities have negatively impacted our revenues, gross margin, and operating income in comparison to the same period in 2023. During the same period in 2023, despite heavy turnaround activity at our refineries, the stronger cracks resulted in overall higher margins. 
 37 

Revenues Revenues totaled 25.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 29.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately 3.5 billion, or 12.0 . Revenues per barrel were 93.10 and 103.04 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 9.6 directly related to lower hydrocarbon commodity prices. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the total throughput rates at our East Coast, Mid-Continent, Gulf Coast, and West Coast refineries averaged approximately 313,200 bpd, 137,400 bpd, 166,900 bpd and 300,700 bpd, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the total throughput rates at our East Coast, Mid-Continent, Gulf Coast, and West Coast refineries averaged approximately 316,300 bpd, 135,000 bpd, 174,300 bpd and 283,600 bpd, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total barrels sold at our East Coast, Mid-Continent, Gulf Coast, and West Coast refineries averaged approximately 354,000 bpd, 145,500 bpd, 160,500 bpd and 348,900 bpd, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, total barrels sold at our East Coast, Mid-Continent, Gulf Coast, and West Coast refineries averaged approximately 358,900 bpd, 146,400 bpd, 183,500 bpd and 347,900 bpd, respectively. 
 Overall average throughput rates at our refineries were higher in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to decreased maintenance activity when compared to the same period in 2023. We plan to continue operating our refineries based on demand and current market conditions. Total refined product barrels sold were higher than throughput rates, reflecting sales from inventory as well as sales and purchases of refined products outside our refineries. 
 Consolidated gross margin Consolidated gross margin totaled (216.6) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2,155.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately 2,372.4 million. Gross refining margin totaled 2,069.0 million, or 8.23 per barrel of throughput for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4,489.1 million, or 18.09 per barrel of throughput for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately 2,420.1 million. Gross refining margin excluding special items totaled 2,223.5 million, or 8.84 per barrel of throughput for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4,489.1 million, or 18.09 per barrel of throughput for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 2,265.6 million. 
 Consolidated gross margin and gross refining margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were negatively impacted by a non-cash LCM adjustment of approximately 154.5 million resulting from the decrease in crude oil and refined product prices from the year ended 2023 to the end of the third quarter of 2024. Gross refining margin excluding special items decreased due to unfavorable movements in crack spreads and crude oil differentials and lower barrels sold at the majority of our refineries, coupled with the timing of our maintenance activity. Consolidated gross margin and gross refining margin were not impacted by special items during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Additionally, our results continue to be impacted by significant costs to comply with the RFS. Total RFS compliance costs were 374.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 637.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Average industry margins were unfavorable during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to decreased refining margins as a result of unfavorable supply and demand dynamics that impacted crack spreads. 
 Favorable movements in benchmark crude differentials typically result in lower crude costs and positively impact our earnings while reductions in these benchmark crude differentials typically result in higher crude costs and negatively impact our earnings.

On the East Coast, the Dated Brent (NYH) 2-1-1 industry crack spread was approximately 19.56 per barrel, or 38.7 lower, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 31.89 per barrel in the same period in 2023. Our margins were positively impacted from our refinery specific slate on the East Coast by strengthened WTI/Bakken differential which increased by 3.67 per barrel, partially offset by a weakened Dated Brent/Maya differential, which decreased by 1.64 per barrel, in comparison to the same period in 2023. The WTI/WCS differential decreased to 15.46 per barrel in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 16.66 in the same period in 2023, which unfavorably impacted our cost of heavy Canadian crude. 
 Across the Mid-Continent, the WTI (Chicago) 4-3-1 industry crack spread was 18.04 per barrel, or 34.8 lower, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 27.67 per barrel in the same period in 2023. Our margins were positively impacted from our refinery specific slate in the Mid-Continent by strengthened WTI/Bakken and WTI/Syncrude differentials, which increased by 3.67 and 3.41 per barrel, respectively, in comparison to the same period in 2023. 
 On the Gulf Coast, the LLS (Gulf Coast) 2-1-1 industry crack spread was 19.60 per barrel, or 39.2 lower, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 32.24 per barrel in the same period in 2023. Margins on the Gulf Coast were negatively impacted from our refinery specific slate by a weakened WTI/LLS differential, which averaged a premium of 2.55 per barrel for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a premium of 2.46 per barrel in the same period of 2023. 
 On the West Coast, the ANS (West Coast) 4-3-1 industry crack spread was 25.19 per barrel, or 38.3 lower, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 40.80 per barrel in the same period in 2023. Additionally, the ANS (West Coast) 3-2-1 industry crack spread was 26.92 per barrel, or 33.6 lower, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 40.53 per barrel in the same period in 2023. Our margins on the West Coast were negatively impacted from our refinery specific slate by a weakened WTI/ANS differential, which averaged a premium of 4.53 per barrel for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a premium of 4.38 per barrel in the same period of 2023. 
 Operating expenses Operating expenses totaled 1,858.0 million, or 7.39 per barrel of throughput, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,936.2 million, or 7.80 per barrel of throughput, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately 78.2 million, or 4.0 . The decrease in operating expenses in comparison to the same period in 2023 was mainly attributable to lower maintenance costs and lower energy costs due to a decrease in natural gas prices, partially offset by higher outside service costs. 
 General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses totaled 186.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 248.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately 61.8 million or 24.9 . The decrease in general and administrative expenses in comparison to the same period in 2023 was due to lower employee-related expenses, including incentive compensation. General and administrative expenses are comprised of personnel, facilities, and other infrastructure costs necessary to support our refineries and related logistics assets. 
 Loss (gain) on sale of assets There was a net loss of 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related primarily to the sale of non-operating refinery assets. There was a net gain of 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related primarily to the sale of a parcel of land at our Torrance refinery. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense Depreciation and amortization expense totaled 432.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (including 427.6 million recorded within Cost of sales) compared to 403.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (including 397.1 million recorded within Cost of sales), an increase of approximately 29.3 million. The increase was a result of a general increase in our fixed asset base due to capital projects and turnarounds completed since the third quarter of 2023. 
 39 

Change in fair value of contingent consideration, net Change in fair value of contingent consideration represented a gain of 3.3 million and a loss of 32.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. These gains and losses were related to changes in the estimated fair value of the Martinez Contingent Consideration. Our final earn-out payment of 18.8 million was paid in full during the second quarter of 2024. 
 Change in fair value of catalyst obligations Change in fair value of catalyst obligations represented a gain of 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This gain related to the change in fair value of the precious metals underlying the sale and leaseback of our refineries precious metal catalysts, which we were obligated to repurchase at fair market value upon lease termination. During September 2023, we settled our remaining outstanding precious metal financing arrangement. 
 Loss on extinguishment of debt There was a loss on the extinguishment of debt of 5.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, related to the redemption of the 2025 Senior Notes and the amendment and restatement of the Revolving Credit Agreement. There was no such loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Interest expense, net Interest expense, net totaled 47.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 53.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately 6.0 million. The net decrease is mainly attributable to the redemption of the 2025 Senior Notes in the third quarter of 2023, and the issuance of our 2030 Senior Notes during the third quarter of 2023 at a reduced principal amount. Additionally, the early termination of the Third Inventory Intermediation Agreement in 2023 further reduced our interest expense. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense includes interest on long-term debt, letter of credit fees associated with the purchase of certain crude oils and the amortization of deferred financing costs. 
 Income tax expense (benefit) As PBF Holding is a limited liability company treated as a flow-through entity for income tax purposes, our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements generally do not include a benefit or expense for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, apart from the income tax attributable to two subsidiaries acquired in connection with the acquisition of the Chalmette refinery in the fourth quarter of 2015 and our Canadian subsidiary, PBF Ltd. These subsidiaries are treated as C-Corporations for income tax purposes. An income tax expense of 0.3 million was recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 in comparison to an income tax benefit of 7.0 million recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Management uses certain financial measures to evaluate our operating performance that are calculated and presented on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP Non-GAAP ). These measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ), and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures reported by other companies. 
 Special Items 
 The Non-GAAP measures presented include EBITDA excluding special items and gross refining margin excluding special items. Special items for the periods presented relate to LCM inventory adjustments, net changes in fair value of contingent consideration, loss on extinguishment of debt, and gain on land sales. See Notes to Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for more details on all special items disclosed. Although we believe that Non-GAAP financial measures, excluding the impact of special items, provide useful supplemental information to investors regarding the results and performance of our business and allow for helpful period-over-period comparisons, such Non-GAAP measures should only be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 Gross Refining Margin and Gross Refining Margin Excluding Special Items 
 Gross refining margin is defined as consolidated gross margin excluding refining depreciation and operating expenses. We believe both gross refining margin and gross refining margin excluding special items are important measures of operating performance and provide useful information to investors because they are helpful metric comparisons to the industry refining margin benchmarks, as the refining margin benchmarks do not include a charge for refining operating expenses and depreciation. In order to assess our operating performance, we compare our gross refining margin (revenues less cost of products and other) to industry refining margin benchmarks and crude oil prices as defined in the table below. 
 Neither gross refining margin nor gross refining margin excluding special items should be considered an alternative to consolidated gross margin, income from operations, net cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Gross refining margin and gross refining margin excluding special items presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation, since each company may define these terms differently.

EBITDA, EBITDA Excluding Special Items and Adjusted EBITDA 
 Our management uses earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ), EBITDA excluding special items and Adjusted EBITDA as measures of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis and to readily view operating trends, as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations, and in communications with our Board of Directors, creditors, analysts and investors concerning our financial performance. Our outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money and other contractual obligations also include similar measures as a basis for certain covenants under those agreements which may differ from the Adjusted EBITDA definition described below. 
 EBITDA, EBITDA excluding special items and Adjusted EBITDA are not presentations made in accordance with GAAP and our computation of EBITDA, EBITDA excluding special items and Adjusted EBITDA may vary from others in our industry. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA contains some, but not all, adjustments that are taken into account in the calculation of the components of various covenants in the agreements governing our senior notes and other credit facilities. EBITDA, EBITDA excluding special items and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to income from operations or net income as measures of operating performance. In addition, EBITDA, EBITDA excluding special items and Adjusted EBITDA are not presented as, and should not be considered, an alternative to cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before adjustments for items such as stock-based compensation expense, change in the fair value of catalyst obligations, LCM inventory adjustment, net change in the fair value of contingent consideration, loss on extinguishment of debt, gain on land sales, and certain other non-cash items. Other companies, including other companies in our industry, may calculate EBITDA, EBITDA excluding special items and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. EBITDA, EBITDA excluding special items and Adjusted EBITDA also have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations include that EBITDA, EBITDA excluding special items and Adjusted EBITDA: 
 do not reflect depreciation expense or our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 
 do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 
 do not reflect our interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt; 
 do not reflect realized and unrealized gains and losses from certain hedging activities, which may have a substantial impact on our cash flow; 
 do not reflect certain other non-cash income and expenses; and 
 exclude income taxes that may represent a reduction in available cash.

Notes to Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 The following notes are applicable to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures above: 
 (1) Special items: 
 LCM inventory adjustment - LCM is a GAAP requirement related to inventory valuation that mandates inventory to be stated at the lower of cost or market. Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the last-in, first-out LIFO inventory valuation methodology, in which the most recently incurred costs are charged to cost of sales and inventories are valued at base layer acquisition costs. Market price is determined based on an assessment of the current estimated replacement cost and net realizable selling price of the inventory. In periods where the market price of our inventory declines substantially, cost values of inventory may exceed market values. In such instances, we record an adjustment to write down the value of inventory to market value in accordance with GAAP. In subsequent periods, the value of inventory is reassessed and an LCM inventory adjustment is recorded to reflect the net change in the LCM inventory reserve between the prior period and the current period. The net impact of these LCM inventory adjustments is included in the Refining segment s income from operations, but are excluded from the operating results presented, as applicable, in order to make such information comparable between periods. 
 During both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an adjustment to value our inventories to the LCM which decreased both income from operations and net income by 154.5 million, reflecting an increase in the LCM inventory reserve of 154.5 million. There were no such adjustments in any other periods presented. 
 Change in fair value of contingent consideration, net - During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a net change in fair value of the Martinez Contingent Consideration which increased both income from operations and net income by 3.3 million. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a change in fair value of the Martinez Contingent Consideration which decreased both income from operations and net income by 65.3 million and 32.4 million, respectively. There was no such change in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Loss on extinguishment of debt - During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt related to the redemption of our 2025 Senior Notes and the amendment and restatement of the Revolving Credit Facility, which decreased both income before income taxes and net income by 5.7 million. There was no such loss in any other periods presented. 
 Gain on land sales - During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a gain on the sale of a separate parcel of real property acquired as part of the Torrance refinery, but not part of the refinery itself, which increased both income from operations and net income by 1.7 million. There were no such gains in any other periods presented. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents and borrowing availability under our credit facility, as described below. We believe that our cash flows from operations and available capital resources will be sufficient to meet our and our subsidiaries capital expenditures, working capital needs, future distributions, and debt service requirements, for the next twelve months. However, our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations depends, in part, on petroleum oil market pricing and general economic, political, and other factors beyond our control. As of September 30, 2024, we are in compliance with all covenants, including financial covenants, in all our debt agreements.

Cash Flow Analysis 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 255.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 1,152.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our operating cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 include our depreciation and amortization of 444.3 million, a net non-cash charge of 154.5 million relating to an LCM inventory adjustment, pension and other post-retirement benefits costs of 38.9 million, stock-based compensation of 30.1 million, and a loss on sale of assets of 0.7 million, partially offset by our net loss of 452.1 million and a net change in the fair value of the Martinez Contingent Consideration of 3.3 million. In addition, net changes in operating assets and liabilities reflected cash proceeds of 42.4 million, primarily driven by the timing of inventory purchases, accounts receivables, and payments to settle accounts payable. Our operating cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included net income of 1,819.1 million, depreciation and amortization of 418.8 million, pension and other post-retirement benefits costs of 35.9 million, net change in the fair value of the Martinez Contingent Consideration of 32.4 million, stock-based compensation of 27.7 million, net non-cash charges related to changes in fair value of our inventory repurchase obligations of 25.1 million, and loss on extinguishment of debt primarily related to the redemption of our 2025 Senior Notes and the amendment and restatement of the Revolving Credit Facility of 5.7 million, partially offset by a deferred incomes tax benefit of 5.9 million, gain on sale of assets of 1.3 million, and a change in the fair value of our catalyst obligations of 1.1 million. In addition, net changes in operating assets and liabilities reflected uses of cash of 1,204.1 million, driven by the timing of inventory purchases, payments for accrued expenses, and collections of accounts receivable. The change in accrued expenses was due primarily to a decrease in renewable energy credit and emissions obligations, as a result of a decrease in our unfunded RINs obligation. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 768.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash used in investing activities of 927.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net cash flows used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was comprised of cash outflows of expenditures for refinery turnarounds of 447.7 million, capital expenditures totaling 292.3 million, and expenditures for other assets of 28.3 million. The net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was comprised of cash outflows of capital expenditures totaling 569.5 million, expenditures for refinery turnarounds of 322.9 million, and expenditures for other assets of 39.5 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets of 4.4 million. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 288.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash used in financing activities of 501.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities consisted primarily of distributions to members of 481.9 million, payments on finance leases of 9.1 million, and deferred financing costs and other of 0.1 million, partially offset by proceeds from contributions from PBF LLC of 185.0 million and proceeds from insurance premium financing of 17.7 million.

Liquidity 
 As of September 30, 2024, our operational liquidity was more than 3.4 billion (more than 4.6 billion as of December 31, 2023) which consists of 927.0 million of cash, and approximately 2.5 billion of borrowing availability under our Revolving Credit Facility, which includes our cash on hand. 
 As of September 30, 2024, outstanding letters of credit totaled approximately 62.5 million. 
 We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including secured indebtedness, subject to the satisfaction of any debt incurrence and, if applicable, lien incurrence limitation covenants in our existing financing agreements. 
 Working Capital 
 Our working capital at September 30, 2024 was 1,166.5 million, consisting of 4,986.9 million in total current assets and 3,820.4 million in total current liabilities. Our working capital at December 31, 2023 was 2,184.0 million, consisting of 6,480.3 million in total current assets and 4,296.3 million in total current liabilities. 
 Capital Spending 
 Capital spending was 768.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and was primarily comprised of annual maintenance and turnaround costs at our East Coast, Mid-Continent, and West Coast refineries. Capital spending also included costs associated with safety related enhancements and facility improvements at our refineries. We currently expect to spend an aggregate of approximately 850.0 million during full-year 2024 for facility improvements and refinery maintenance and turnarounds, as well as expenditures to meet environmental, regulatory and safety requirements. 
 Crude and Feedstock Supply Agreements 
 We currently purchase all of our crude and feedstock needs from various suppliers, primarily through short-term and spot market agreements. We also have a crude supply agreement with Saudi Aramco, the term of which is currently year to year, for up to approximately 100,000 bpd that is processed at the Paulsboro refinery and crude supply agreements with Shell Trading (US) Company (primarily serving our Martinez refinery) for up to approximately 65,000 bpd, through 2026. 
 Distributions 
 We make, from time to time, distributions to PBF LLC, if necessary, in order for PBF LLC to make pro rata distributions to its members, including PBF Energy, necessary to fund in excess of one year s cash dividend payments by PBF Energy. 
 On October 31, 2024, PBF Energy, our indirect parent, announced a dividend of 0.275 per share on its outstanding Class A common stock. The dividend is payable on November 27, 2024 to PBF Energy Class A common stockholders of record at the close of business on November 13, 2024. If necessary, we may need to make cash distributions to PBF LLC to the extent necessary for PBF Energy to pay this dividend. PBF Energy will then use this distribution to fund the dividend payments to the stockholders of PBF Energy. 
 In cases when there is sufficient cash and cash equivalents and borrowing capacity, we are permitted under our debt agreements to make these distributions; however, our ability to continue to comply with our debt covenants is, to a significant degree, subject to our operating results, which are dependent on a number of factors outside of our control.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to market risks, including changes in commodity prices and interest rates. Our primary commodity price risk is associated with the difference between the prices we sell our refined products and the prices we pay for crude oil and other feedstocks. We may use derivative instruments to manage the risks from changes in the prices of crude oil and refined products, natural gas, interest rates, or to capture market opportunities. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 Our earnings, cash flow and liquidity are significantly affected by a variety of factors beyond our control, including the supply of, and demand for, crude oil, other feedstocks, refined products, and natural gas. The supply of and demand for these commodities depend on, among other factors, changes in domestic and foreign economies, weather conditions, domestic and foreign political affairs, planned and unplanned downtime in refineries, pipelines and production facilities, production levels, the availability of imports, the marketing of competitive and alternative fuels, and the extent of government regulation. As a result, the prices of these commodities can be volatile. Our revenues fluctuate significantly with movements in industry refined product prices, our cost of sales fluctuates significantly with movements in crude oil and feedstock prices and our operating expenses fluctuate with movements in the price of natural gas. We manage our exposure to these commodity price risks through our supply and offtake agreements as well as through the use of various commodity derivative instruments. 
 We may use non-trading derivative instruments to manage exposure to commodity price risks associated with the purchase or sale of crude oil and feedstocks, finished products and natural gas outside of our supply and offtake agreements. The derivative instruments we use include physical commodity contracts and exchange-traded and over-the-counter financial instruments. We mark-to-market our commodity derivative instruments and recognize the changes in their fair value in our statements of operations. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had gross open commodity derivative contracts representing 45.3 million barrels and 29.1 million barrels, respectively, with an unrealized net loss of 3.2 million and net gain of 33.2 million, respectively. The open commodity derivative contracts as of September 30, 2024 expire at various times during 2024 and 2025. 
 We carry inventories of crude oil, intermediates, and refined products hydrocarbon inventories on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, the values of which are subject to fluctuations in market prices. Our hydrocarbon inventories totaled approximately 30.7 million barrels and 36.2 million barrels at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The average cost of our hydrocarbon inventories was approximately 84.62 and 83.64 per barrel on a LIFO basis at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The average cost of our hydrocarbon inventories at September 30, 2024 excludes the net impact of an LCM inventory adjustment of approximately 154.5 million, whereas at December 31, 2023, the replacement value of inventory exceeded the LIFO carrying value. If market prices of our inventory decline to a level below our average cost, we may be required to write down the carrying value of our hydrocarbon inventories to market. 
 Our predominant variable operating cost is energy, which is comprised primarily of natural gas and electricity. We are therefore sensitive to movements in natural gas prices. Assuming normal operating conditions, we expect our annual consumption to range from 70 million to 90 million MMBTUs of natural gas amongst our six refineries. Accordingly, a 1.00 per MMBTU change in natural gas prices would increase or decrease our natural gas costs by approximately 70.0 million to 90.0 million. 
 50 

Compliance Program Price Risk 
 We are exposed to market risks related to our obligations to buy, and the volatility in the price of, credits needed to comply with various governmental and regulatory compliance programs, which include RINs, required to comply with the RFS. Our overall RINs obligation is based on a percentage of our domestic shipments of on-road fuels as established by Environmental Protection Agency. To the degree we are unable to blend the required amount of biofuels to satisfy our RINs obligation, we must purchase RINs on the open market. To mitigate the impact of the market risk relating to our obligations on our results of operations and cash flows, we may elect to purchase RINs or other environmental credits as part of our liability management strategy. We also have the ability to purchase RINs directly from SBR. 
 In addition, we are exposed to risks associated with complying with federal and state legislative and regulatory measures to address GHG and other emissions. Requirements to reduce emissions could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities as well as implement and manage new emission controls and programs put in place. Compliance with such emission standards may require the purchase of emission credits or similar instruments. 
 Certain of these compliance contracts or instruments qualify as derivative instruments. For certain of these contracts, we elect the normal purchase normal sale exception under Accounting Standards Codification 815, Derivatives and Hedging, for such instruments, and therefore do not record these contracts at their fair value. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 The maximum commitment under our Revolving Credit Facility is 3.5 billion. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest either at the Alternative Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin or at the Term SOFR plus the Applicable Margin, all as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement. At September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding balance in variable interest debt. If this facility were fully drawn, a 1.0 change in the interest rate would increase or decrease our interest expense by approximately 23.6 million annually. 
 Credit Risk 
 We are subject to risk of losses resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our counterparties. We continue to closely monitor the creditworthiness of customers to whom we grant credit and establish credit limits in accordance with our credit policy. 
 51 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We conducted evaluations, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of September 30, 2024. Based upon these evaluations, as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b), the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 
 52 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 In connection with the acquisition of the Torrance refinery and related logistics assets, we assumed certain pre-existing environmental liabilities related to certain environmental remediation obligations to address existing soil and groundwater contamination and monitoring activities, which reflect the estimated cost of the remediation obligations. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of the Torrance refinery and related logistics assets, we purchased a ten-year, 100.0 million environmental insurance policy to insure against unknown environmental liabilities. 
 We currently have multiple outstanding notices of violation NOVs issued by regulatory authorities for various alleged regulation and permit violations at our refineries. It is not possible to predict the outcome of any of these NOVs or the amount of the penalties that will be assessed in connection with any NOV. If any one or more of them were decided against us, we believe that there would be no material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. SEC regulations require us to disclose certain information about proceedings arising under federal, state, or local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or primarily for the purpose of protecting the environment, if a governmental authority is a party to such proceeding and such proceeding involves potential monetary sanctions, exclusive of interest and costs, that exceeds a specified threshold. We use a threshold of 1 million for such determination because we believe that such threshold is reasonably designed to result in disclosure of any such proceeding that is material to the business or financial condition. 
 On November 24, 2022, the Martinez refinery, owned and operated by MRC experienced a spent catalyst release that is currently being investigated by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District BAAQMD ), Contra Costa County CCC ), the Department of Justice and the Environmental Protection Agency EPA ), and the California Department of Fish and Game DFG ). To date, the BAAQMD has issued 35 NOVs, the CCC has issued two NOVs, and the DFG has made findings relating to the spent catalyst incident. On July 11, 2023 and October 6, 2023, the Martinez refinery experienced unintentional releases of petroleum coke dust and received inquiries or notices of investigation from the BAAQMD, the California Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Occupational Safety and Health CalOSHA ), the CCC, and the EPA. The BAAQMD also issued an NOV relating to the July 11, 2023 coke dust incident and an NOV relating to the October 6, 2023 coke dust incident. On December 15, 2023, the Martinez refinery experienced an unexpected flaring incident, and subsequently on December 18, 2023 a brush fire incident, and has received inquiries or notices of investigation from the BAAQMD, CalOSHA, and the CCC. The BAAQMD additionally issued an NOV relating to the December 15, 2023 flaring incident and four NOVs relating to the December 18, 2023 brush fire incident. The DFG, the CCC, and the BAAQMD have referred their findings and/or NOVs to the CCC District Attorney for the spent catalyst incident and various other incidents. On November 16, 2023, the CCC District Attorney and the BAAQMD announced a joint civil enforcement action against MRC that will include enforcement of the BAAQMD s, the CCC s, and the DFG s claims from the spent catalyst incident, as well as additional enforcement claims from various incidents. For the spent catalyst, coke dust, flaring, brush fire, and other incidents, no penalties have been assessed to date by the various agencies. We presently believe the outcomes will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

On September 27, 2023, MRC received from the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board RWQCB an Administrative Civil Liability ACL assessment in the amount of 13.8 million for allegedly: (1) exceeding its effluent limitations and discharging to the Carquinez Strait without authorization in October 2022, January 2023, and June 2023; and (2) failing to submit Climate Change Adaptation information. On January 12, 2024, MRC met with the RWQCB to discuss its response to their ACL assessment. Based on the discussions and the information provided by MRC, the RWQCB proposed reducing the ACL assessment to approximately 4.5 million and noted that for any settlement 50 of the penalty could be in the form of Enhanced Compliance Actions ECAs ), Supplemental Environmental Projects SEPs ), or a combination of the two. On January 19, 2024, MRC agreed to accept the reduced ACL, with 50 of the approximately 4.5 million dedicated to ECAs or SEPs. MRC subsequently agreed to fund only SEPs relating to marsh restoration, regional water quality monitoring, and water quality classroom education in the Martinez, California area. The parties are finalizing the settlement agreement and stipulation for entry of the administrative civil liability order. Once it is finalized, it will be subject to a 30-day comment period before approval by the RWQCB s Executive Officer. 
 On February 17, 2017, in Arnold Goldstein, et al. v. Exxon Mobil Corporation, et al. , PBF Energy Inc., PBF LLC, and our subsidiaries, PBF Western Region and Torrance Refining and the manager of our Torrance refinery along with ExxonMobil were named as defendants in a class action and representative action complaint. The complaint was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles and alleges negligence, strict liability, ultra-hazardous activity, a continuing private nuisance, a permanent private nuisance, a continuing public nuisance, a permanent public nuisance and trespass resulting from the February 18, 2015 electrostatic precipitator ESP explosion at the Torrance refinery which was then owned and operated by ExxonMobil. The operation of the Torrance refinery by the PBF entities subsequent to our acquisition in July 2016 is also referenced in the complaint. To the extent that plaintiffs claims relate to the ESP explosion, ExxonMobil retained responsibility for any liabilities that would arise from the lawsuit pursuant to the agreement relating to the acquisition of the Torrance refinery. On July 2, 2018, the Court granted leave to plaintiffs to file a Second Amended Complaint alleging groundwater contamination. With the filing of the Second Amended Complaint, plaintiffs added an additional plaintiff, Hany Youssef. On October 15, 2019, the judge granted certification to two limited classes of property owners with Youssef as the sole class representative and named plaintiff, rejecting two other proposed subclasses based on negligence and on strict liability for ultrahazardous activities. The certified subclasses relate to trespass claims for ground contamination and nuisance for air emissions. On May 5, 2021, the Court granted plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint for the third time to substitute Navarro for Youssef. On July 5, 2022, the Court issued a final order ruling that plaintiffs Motion to Substitute Navarro as Class Representative was denied and decertifying both of plaintiffs proposed Air and Ground Subclasses. The order provided that the case will proceed with Navarro as the sole plaintiff. On September 22, 2022, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. On February 27, 2023, the Court issued an order granting our motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed plaintiff s trespass claim with prejudice and granted plaintiff leave to amend his nuisance claims in conformity with the order if he can do so consistent with Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedures. On March 27, 2023, plaintiff filed a Fourth Amended Complaint relating to the remaining nuisance claims. On May 23, 2023, the Court denied our motion to dismiss on the pleadings for plaintiff s failure to establish standing to bring the nuisance claims. After completing further discovery, on August 28, 2023, we filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. On October 18, 2023, the Court issued an order granting our motion, adjudged that plaintiff take nothing, and that the action be dismissed with prejudice. The order also allows us to recover the costs of suit pursuant to a bill of costs. On October 30, 2023, plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit regarding the Court s order granting summary judgment. The Court has granted plaintiff extensions of approximately 90 days to file their opening brief, which they filed on May 27, 2024. After being granted a similar 90-day extension, we filed our answering brief on September 25, 2024. Plaintiff s reply brief is due January 24, 2025. We presently believe the outcome of this litigation will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

On August 16, 2023, in Joseph Piscitelli and Lara Zanzucchi v. Martinez Refining Company LLC , our subsidiary MRC was named as a defendant in a class action and representative action complaint which contains allegations of public and private nuisance, trespass, and negligence arising from MRC s operations. MRC filed its answer to the complaint on October 31, 2023. The initial Court hearing to discuss discovery issues was held on January 2, 2024. At the hearing, the Court raised the issue of mediation and directed the parties to meet and confer and agree to stipulate to a mediation deadline. On January 9, 2024, the parties filed a stipulation agreeing to consider private mediation by September 20, 2024. On January 17, 2024, the Court issued a scheduling order setting the class certification hearing for April 10, 2025. On April 4, 2024, the Court granted plaintiffs motion for leave to file a First Amendment Complaint (the Piscitelli FAC to add plaintiff Malan and dismiss plaintiff Zanzucchi, which plaintiffs filed on April 10, 2024. On the same day, the Court granted plaintiffs motion. MRC filed its answer to the Piscitelli FAC on April 23, 2024. On May 3, 2024, the Court denied MRC s motion to relate this case and the Cruz case (discussed below). On June 17, 2024, the Court granted plaintiffs motion to dismiss plaintiff Piscitelli. The parties are currently engaged in discovery. The class certification hearing is currently scheduled for April 10, 2025. We presently believe the outcome will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
 On December 15, 2023, in Alena Cruz and Shannon Payne vs. PBF Energy Inc., et. al , we and our subsidiaries PBF Western Region and MRC were named as defendants in a class action and representative action complaint filed by Alena Cruz and Shannon Payne, and on behalf of all others similarly situated. The complaint contains allegations of Clean Air Act CAA violations, claims for medical and environmental monitoring, liability for ultrahazardous activities, negligence, and public and private nuisance from MRC s operations. The proposed class is all individuals who reside and/or work in the City of Martinez, including the surrounding communities of Alhambra Valley and Franklin Canyon, as well as El Sobrante, Hercules, Benicia, and Richmond, who have allegedly been exposed to elevated levels of spent catalyst discharged from MRC s operations during the period November 24, 2022 to the present. On December 21, 2023, plaintiffs granted an extension until February 5, 2024 for MRC to respond to the initial complaint. On February 5, 2024, MRC filed a motion to dismiss on the pleadings. In response, on February 16, 2024, plaintiffs filed a First Amendment Complaint (the Cruz FAC ). On February 29, 2024, MRC filed a motion to dismiss the Cruz FAC on the pleadings. Plaintiffs opposition was filed on March 14, 2024. MRC filed its reply to plaintiffs opposition on March 21, 2024. At the motion hearing on April 4, 2024, the Court granted MRC s request to dismiss all wrongly named PBF entities and plaintiffs CAA and Medical Monitoring causes of action. At the following Status Conference on April 4, 2024, the Court agreed that the Cruz and Piscitelli cases should now be related. The Court ordered the Cruz and Piscitelli plaintiffs to meet and confer on a joint discovery schedule and report back to the Court by the end of April 2024. On May 3, 2024, the Piscitelli Court denied MRC s motion to relate this case and the Piscitelli case (discussed above). On May 17, 2024, MRC filed its answer to the Cruz FAC. On June 5, 2024, the Court stayed the case, pending the outcome of the class property damage claim in the Piscitelli case. We presently believe the outcome will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
 On July 31, 2024, in Jennifer Frye, et al. v. Martinez Refining Company LLC , MRC was named as a defendant in a complaint filed by 18 individuals which contains allegations of negligence, public and private nuisance, premise liability, trespass, and strict liability ultrahazardous activities. On October 7, 2024, MRC filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. Also on October 7, 2024, plaintiffs filed a motion to relate the Frye case to the Piscitelli and Cruz cases. The Piscitelli Court subsequently denied the motion to relate the three cases. The motion to relate Frye to the Cruz case is currently pending with the Cruz Court. Currently, Plaintiffs opposition brief to MRC s motion to dismiss is due November 11, 2024, MRC s reply brief is due November 22, 2024, and the motion hearing is currently scheduled for December 20, 2024.

On December 21, 2023, EPA Region 5 issued a Finding of Violation FOV alleging violations of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7411, 7412, and regulations promulgated under those sections, of the National Emission Standard for Benzene Waste Operations at 40 C.F.R. Part 61, Subpart FF, of the New Source Performance Standards for Volatile Organic Compounds from Petroleum Wastewater Systems at 40 C.F.R. Part 60, Subpart QQQ, and of our CAA Title V operating permit for the Wastewater Treatment Unit at our Toledo refinery. This FOV followed an EPA compliance inspection at the Toledo refinery conducted in September 2023. We have recently been engaged in discussions with EPA to resolve these matters, but we cannot currently estimate the timing of the resolution or the amount of any potential civil penalties. We presently believe the outcome will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
 The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 CERCLA ), also known as Superfund, imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the current or former owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed of or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for investigation and the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. As discussed more fully above, certain of our sites are subject to these laws and we may be held liable for investigation and remediation costs or claims for natural resource damages. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. Analogous state laws impose similar responsibilities and liabilities on responsible parties. In our current normal operations, we have generated waste, some of which falls within the statutory definition of a hazardous substance and some of which may have been disposed of at sites that may require cleanup under Superfund. 
 As the ultimate outcomes of the pending matters discussed above are uncertain, we cannot currently estimate the final amount or timing of their resolution, but any such amount is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, individually or in the aggregate.
