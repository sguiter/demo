million and million for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Accumulated deficit amounted to approximately million and million as of September 30, 2024
and December 31, 2023, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities was million and million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

The Company s liquidity is based on its
ability to increase its operating cash flow position, obtain capital financing from equity interest investors and borrow money to fund
its general operations, research and development activities, and capital expenditures. The Company s ability to continue as a going
concern is dependent on management s ability to successfully execute its business plan, which includes increasing revenue while
controlling operating costs and expenses and obtaining funds from outside sources to generate positive financing cash flows. As of September
30, 2024, the Company s unrestricted cash balance was million, and its short-term investments balance was million.
As of December 31, 2023, the Company s unrestricted cash balance was million, and its short-term investments balance was
 million. 

Based on cash flow projections from operating,
investing and financing activities and the existing balance of cash and short-term investments, management is of the opinion that the
Company has insufficient funds for sustainable operations, and it may not be able to meet its payment obligations from operations and
related commitments, if the Company is not able to complete the required funding transactions to allow the Company to continue as a going
concern. Based on these factors, the Company has substantial doubt that it will continue as a going concern for the 12 months following
the date these financial statements were issued. These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect
the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that may result in the Company not being
able to continue as a going concern. 

The Company s plan to alleviate the going
concern issue is to increase revenue while controlling operating costs and expenses and obtaining funds from outside sources of financing
to generate positive financing cash flows. While management is optimistic about its ability to raise substantial funds to continue as
a going concern for one year following the financial statement issuance date, there can be no assurance that any such measures will be
successful. We currently do not generate substantial revenue from product sales. Accordingly, we expect to rely primarily on equity and/or
debt financings to fund our continued operations. The Company s ability to raise additional funds will depend, in part, on the success
of our product development activities, and other events or conditions that may affect the share value or prospects, as well as factors
related to financial, economic and market conditions, many of which are beyond our control. There can be no assurances that sufficient
funds will be available to us when required or on acceptable terms, if at all. Accordingly, management has concluded that these
plans do not alleviate substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.

in the determination of the useful life. Amortization of the software asset will begin when the software is substantially complete and
ready for its intended use. No amortization has begun for the internal use software, as the projects are still in the application development
phase. Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on a quarterly basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. No impairment charges were associated with the Company s

for these rights. The Company evaluated if substantially all of the
assets acquired are concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets to determine if the transaction
should be accounted for as an asset acquisition. Since the only substantive assets acquired pertained to rights to intellectual property,
the entire purchase price was allocated to intellectual property and accounted for as intangible assets with a useful life of years.
In accordance with ASC 805-50, Business Combination , the agreement was treated as an asset acquisition rather than a business
combination. For the year ended December 31, 2023 the Company determined the existence of an impairment associated with the Company s
intangible asset Rights to intellectual property and accordingly recorded an impairment charge of . As of September

ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment ,
defines a multi-step process to test long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for recoverability that if failed would indicate
impairment. First, the Company must consider whether indicators of impairment of long-lived assets are present. The Company determined
the Triggering Events in conjunction with preparation of its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 provided such indication. 

Next, the Company must review the long-lived assets
to define asset group(s) that would reflect the lowest level of assets to which discrete cash flows are identifiable, and test these asset
groups for impairment. 

In performing this review, the Company identified
that the long-lived asset Patents , which have international and U.S. based patents, as the asset group. The Company evaluated
its patents and identified expired international patent applications expired assets for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024. The Company determined there were no further plans to put resources toward these international patent applications.
The group of expired patents carrying value was set to its salvage value which is zero given no future cash flows. 

For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024, the Company recorded a and , respectively, impairment charge under gain (loss) on disposal assets, which is included
in other income (expense) on its condensed consolidated statement of operations, to adjust the expiring assets salvage value of .

It was determined for all remaining long-lived
assets (excluding the Abandoned Asset) that there were no triggering events, and therefore, no further impairment charges to long-lived
assets were necessary as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

The Company accounts for warrants in accordance
with ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity , depending on the specific terms of the warrant agreement. The
Company determined the fair value of the warrants using the Black-Scholes pricing model and treated the valuation as equity
instruments in consideration of the cashless settlement provisions in the warrant agreements. The warrants are not marked-to-market each
reporting period, and thus there is no impact to earnings. Any future exercises of the warrants will be recorded as cash received and
recorded in cash, with a corresponding increase to common stock and additional paid-in capital in stockholders equity.

Reverse Stock Split 

On June 25, 2024, the Company s stockholders
voted to authorize the Company s Board of Directors to effect a reverse stock split of the outstanding shares of common stock within
a range of to . On June 25, 2024, the Company s Board of Directors determined to effect the reverse stock split
of the common stock at a ratio, which reverse split became effective in the market on July 5, 2024. 

The Company s primary reasons for effecting
the reverse stock split was to increase the per share price of our common stock to meet Nasdaq s minimum bid price requirement for
continued listing on Nasdaq.

Determining the grant date fair value of options
requires management to make assumptions and judgments. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and if different assumptions had
been used, stock-based compensation expense could have been materially different from the amounts recorded. 

The assumptions and estimates for valuing stock
options are as follows: 

Fair value per share of Company s common stock. Because there was no public market for Cyngn s common stock prior to the IPO, its Board of Directors, with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist, determined the common stock fair value at the time of the grant of stock options by considering a number of objective and subjective factors, including its actual operating and financial performance, market conditions and performance of comparable publicly traded companies, developments and milestones in the Company, and the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event among other factors. Since the Company s common stock began publicly trading on the Nasdaq, the value of its common stock underlying stock options or RSUs has been valued based on prevailing market prices. 

Expected volatility. Because the Company s common stock had no publicly traded history prior to the IPO, it estimated the expected volatility using a combination of its stock price volatility and the stock price volatility of peer companies, for a period equal to the expected term of the options. 

Expected term. The expected term of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period that the stock options are expected to remain outstanding. The Company estimates the expected term of options granted based upon the simplified method provided under Staff Accounting Bulletin, Topic 14 , or SAB Topic 14. 

Risk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect during the period the options were granted corresponding to the expected term of the awards. 

Estimated dividend yield. The estimated dividend yield is zero, as the Company does not currently intend to declare dividends in the foreseeable future. 

Equity Incentive Plans 

In February 2013, the Company s Board of
Directors adopted the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan 2013 Plan ). The 2013 Plan authorizes the award of stock options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, performance awards, and other stock or cash awards.

The fair value of a stock option is estimated
using an option-pricing model that takes into account as of the grant date the exercise price and expected life of the option, the current
price of the underlying stock and its expected volatility, expected dividends on the stock, and the risk-free interest rate for the expected
term of the option. The Company has used the simplified method in calculating the expected term of all option grants based on the vesting
period and contractual term. Compensation costs related to share-based payment transactions are recognized in the financial statements
upon satisfaction of the requisite service or vesting requirements.

For financial reporting purposes, the Company s
effective tax rate used for the interim periods is based on the estimated full-year income tax rate. For the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024, the Company s effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate, primarily due to a valuation allowance recorded

Overview 

We are an autonomous vehicle AV technology company that is focused on addressing industrial uses for autonomous vehicles. We believe that technological
innovation is needed to enable adoption of autonomous industrial vehicles that will address the substantial industry challenges that exist
today. These challenges include labor shortages, lagging technological advancements from incumbent vehicle manufacturers, and high upfront
investment commitment. 

Industrial sites are typically
rigid environments with consistent standards as opposed to city streets that have more variable environmental and situational conditions
and diverse regulations. These differences in operational design domains will be major factors that make proliferation of industrial AVs
in private settings achievable with less time and resources than AVs on public roadways. Namely, safety and infrastructure challenges
are cited as roadblocks that have delayed AVs from operating on public roadways at scale. Our focus on industrial AVs simplifies these
challenges because industrial facilities (especially those belonging to a single end customer that operates similarly at different
sites) share much more in common than different cities do. Furthermore, our end customers own their infrastructure and can make changes
more easily than governments can on public roadways. 

With these challenges in mind,
we have developed an Enterprise Autonomy Suite EAS that leverages advanced in-vehicle autonomous driving technology
and incorporates leading supporting technologies like data analytics, asset tracking, fleet management, cloud, and connectivity. EAS provides
a differentiated solution that we believe drives pervasive proliferation of industrial autonomy and creates value for customers at every
stage of their journey towards full automation and the adoption of Industry 4.0. 

25 

EAS is a suite of technologies
and tools that we divide into three complementary categories: 

1. 
 DriveMod , our modular industrial vehicle autonomous driving software; 

2. 
 Cyngn Insight , our customer-facing tool suite for monitoring and managing AV fleets (including remotely operated vehicles) and generating/aggregating/analyzing data (including the IoT gateway device); and 

3. 
 Cyngn Evolve , our internal tool suite and infrastructure that facilitates artificial intelligence AI and machine learning ML training to continuously enhance our algorithms and models and provides a simulation framework (both record/rerun and synthetic scenario creation) to ensure that data collected in the field can be applied to validating new releases. 

Legacy automation providers
manufacture specialized industrial vehicles with integrated robotics software for rigidly defined tasks, limiting automation to narrow
uses. Unlike these specialized vehicles, EAS can be compatible with the existing vehicle assets in addition to new vehicles that have
been purposely built for autonomy by vehicle manufacturers. EAS is operationally expansive, vehicle agnostic, and compatible with indoor
and outdoor environments. By offering flexible autonomous services, we aim to remove barriers to industry adoption. 

We understand that scaling
of autonomy solutions will require an ecosystem made up of different technologies and services that are enablers for AVs. Our approach
is to forge strategic collaborations with complementary technology providers that accelerate AV development and deployment, provide access
to new markets, and create new capabilities. Our focus on designing DriveMod to be modular will combine with our experience deploying
AV technology on diverse industrial vehicle form factors, which will be difficult for competitors to replicate. 

We expect our technology to
generate revenue through two main methods: deployment and EAS subscriptions. Deploying our EAS requires us and our integration partners
to work with a new client to map the job site, gather data, and install our AV technology within their fleet and site. We anticipate that
new deployments will yield project-based revenues based on the scope of the deployment. After deployment, we expect to generate revenues
by offering EAS through a Software as a Service SaaS model, which can be considered the AV software component of Robotics
as a Service RaaS ). 

RaaS is a subscription model
that allows customers to use robots/vehicles without necessarily purchasing the hardware assets upfront. We will seek to achieve sustained
revenue growth largely from ongoing SaaS-style EAS subscriptions that enable companies to tap into our ever-expanding suite
of AV and AI capabilities as organizations transition into full industrial autonomy. 

Although both the components
and the combined solutions of EAS are still under development, EAS has already been used for a paid customer deployment as well as for
paid trial and pilot deployments. We have not yet derived any significant recurring revenues from EAS but began marketing EAS to customers
in 2022 with our first commercial deployment commencing in the first quarter of 2023. We expect EAS to continually be developed and enhanced
according to evolving customer needs, which will take place concurrently while other completed features of EAS are commercialized. We
expect annual R D expenditures in the foreseeable future to exceed that of 2023. We also had limited paid deployments in 2023 which
offset some of the ongoing R D costs of continually developing EAS. We target scaled deployments to begin in the towards the end of
2024. 

Our go-to-market strategy
is to acquire new customers that use industrial vehicles in their mission-critical and daily operations by (a) leveraging the relationships
and existing customers of our network of strategic partners, (b) bringing AV capabilities to industrial vehicles as a software service
provider, and (c) executing a robust in-house sales and marketing effort to nurture a pipeline of industrial organizations. Our focus
is on acquiring new customers who are either looking (a) to embed our technology into their vehicle product roadmaps or (b) to apply autonomy
to existing fleets with our vehicle retrofits. In turn, our customers are any organizations that could utilize our EAS solution, including
original equipment manufacturers OEMs that supply industrial vehicles, end customers that operate their own industrial
vehicles, or service providers that operate industrial vehicles for end customers. 

26 

As OEMs and leading industrial
vehicle users seek to increase productivity, reinforce safer working environments, and scale their operations, we believe we are uniquely
positioned to deliver a dynamic autonomy solution via our EAS to a wide variety of industrial uses. Our long-term vision is for EAS
to become a universal autonomous driving solution with minimal marginal cost for companies to adopt new vehicles and expand their autonomous
fleets across new deployments. We have already deployed DriveMod software on more than 10 different vehicle form factors that range from
stockchasers and forklifts to 14-seat shuttles and 5-meter-long cargo vehicles, demonstrating the extensibility of our AV building
blocks. 

Our strategy upon establishing
a customer relationship with an OEM is to seek to embed our technology into their vehicle roadmap and expand our services to their clients.
Once we solidify an initial AV deployment with a customer, we intend to expand within the site to additional vehicle platforms and/or
expand the use of similar vehicles to other sites operated by the customer. This land and expand strategy can repeat iteratively
across new vehicles and sites and is at the heart of why we believe industrial AVs that operate in constrained environments are poised
to create value. 

Recent Developments 

Public Offering 

On April 23, 2024, the Company
entered into an underwritten Agreement with Aegis Capital Corp. Aegis ), pursuant to which Aegis acted as the Company s
underwriter on a firm commitment basis in connection with the sale by the Company of an aggregate of 500,000 (1) shares of common
stock in a public offering, which included: (i) 198,000 (1) shares of common stock, and (ii) pre-funded warrants to purchase
302,000 (1) shares of common stock. The Pre-Funded Warrants had a nominal exercise price of 0.00001. Each share of common
stock was sold at an offering price of 0.10, and each Pre-Funded Warrant was sold at an offering price of 0.09999. On May 3, the Company
closed on the sale of an additional 20,400 (1) shares of common stock, upon exercise by the underwriter of the over-allotment
option. The Company received gross proceeds of approximately 5.2 million before deducting transaction related expenses payable by the
Company. 

Amended Bylaws 

On May 7, 2024, we amended
our Amended and Restated Bylaws (the Amended Bylaws ), for the purpose of reducing the quorum required to hold meetings of
the stockholders of the Company (the Quorum Requirement ). The Amended Bylaws reduced the Quorum Requirement from a majority
to one-third (1/3rd) of the voting power of the shares of stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the meeting. The Amended
Bylaws was approved by the Board of Directors of the Company on May 7, 2024. 

Reverse Stock Split 

At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders
on June 25, 2024, the stockholders of the Company approved the grant of discretionary authority to the board of directors of the Company
to effect a reverse stock split of its outstanding shares of common stock at a specific ratio within a range of one-for-five (1-for-5)
to a maximum of a one-for-one hundred (1-for-100) split. On July 3, 2024, we implemented a 1-for-100 reverse stock split (the Reverse
Stock Split of our common stock. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every one hundred (100) shares of our pre-Reverse Stock
Split common stock were combined and reclassified into one share of our common stock. The number of shares of common stock subject to
outstanding options and warrants were also reduced by a factor of one hundred and the exercise price of such securities increased by a
factor of one hundred effective as of July 3, 2024. Our common stock commenced trading on a post- reverse stock split basis on July 5,
2024. 

NASDAQ Compliance 

On July 19, 2024, the Company
was notified by Nasdaq that the Company has regained compliance with the bid price requirement as set forth in Listing Rule 5550(a)(2),
and that the Company is therefore in compliance with the Nasdaq Capital Market s listing requirements and will remain listed on
Nasdaq.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
and Judgements 

Our condensed consolidated
financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and SEC regulations.
The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. We continually evaluate our estimates and judgments. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience
and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change
and additional information becomes known. Besides the estimates identified below that are considered critical, we make many other accounting
estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. All estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as disclosures of contingent liabilities. These estimates and judgments
are also based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Materially different
results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, even for estimates and judgments that are not deemed
critical. 

The Company considers capitalized
software, warrants and share-based compensation to be critical accounting estimates and believes the associated assumptions and estimates
will have the greatest potential impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Costs to Develop Software 

The Company incurs costs related
to software internally developed. Based on the nature of the software the Company capitalizes software costs under the following guidance. 

Internal-Use Software 

The Company capitalizes certain
costs related to internal-use software, primarily consisting of direct labor and third-party vendor costs associated with creating the
software. Software development projects generally include three stages: the preliminary project stage (all costs are expensed as incurred),
the application development stage (certain costs are capitalized and certain costs are expensed as incurred) and the post-implementation/operation
stage (all costs are expensed as incurred). Costs capitalized in the application development stage include costs related to the design
and implementation of the selected software components, software build and configuration infrastructure, and software interfaces. Capitalization
of costs requires judgment in determining when a project has reached the application development stage, the proportion of time spent in
the application development stage, and the period over which the Company expect to benefit from the use of that software. Once the software
is placed in service, these costs are amortized on the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which is generally
three to five years. There is judgment involved in the determination of the useful life. Internal-use software is classified as property
and equipment in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other . 

Costs to develop software to be sold, leased
or otherwise marketed 

The Company accounts for research
costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed as expense until technological feasibility has been established
for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for
general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have
determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly after a working prototype is complete and meets
or exceeds design specifications including functions, features, and technical performance requirements. After technological feasibility
is established, judgement is required to determine the amount of payroll and stock-based compensation costs to be capitalized on the remaining
development efforts. These costs will continue to be capitalized until such time as when the product or enhancement is available for general
release to customers. Computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed is classified as an intangible asset in accordance with
ASC 985, Software . 

28 

Common Stock Warrants 

The Company issued to its lead
underwriter in the Company s initial public offering consummated in October 2021, (the IPO warrants to purchase up
to 1,400 (1) shares of its common stock, exercisable at a price per share of 937.50 (1) and expiring on October 19,
2026. Additionally, in connection with the Private Placement offering completed on April 29, 2022, the Company issued warrants to purchase
70,969 (1) shares of its common stock, exercisable at a price per share of 271 (1) and expiring on April 29, 2027.
The Company accounts for warrants in accordance with ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity , depending on
the specific terms of the warrant agreement. The Company determined the fair value of the warrants using the Black-Scholes pricing
model and treated the warrants as equity instruments in consideration of the cashless settlement provisions in the warrant agreement. 

The Company also applied the
guidance in ASC 340-10-S99-1, Other Assets and Deferred Costs , that states specific incremental costs directly attributable
to a proposed or actual offering of equity securities may properly be deferred and charged against the gross proceeds of the offering.
The Company treated the valuation of the warrants as directly attributable to the issuance of an equity contract and, accordingly, classified
the warrants as additional paid-in capital. 

Stock-based Compensation 

The Company recognizes the
cost of share-based awards granted to employees and directors based on the estimated grant-date fair value of the awards. Cost is recognized
on a straight-line basis over the service period, which is generally the vesting period of the award. The Company recognizes stock-based
compensation cost and reverses previously recognized costs for unvested awards in the period forfeitures occur. The Company determines
the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which is impacted by the fair value of common stock, expected
price volatility of common stock, expected term, risk-free interest rates, and expected dividend yield. 

Results of Operations 

Revenue 

We currently derive revenue
from four sources. We enter into fixed-price NRE contracts related to trial projects that consist of several independent phases and include
design, data gathering, hardware installation on an industrial vehicle, customer-specific configuration of the DriveMod software, and
demonstrations. The determination of the contract price is based on labor and hardware costs estimated to achieve the required milestones
specified in the contract. The purpose of these fully funded projects is to exhibit the feasibility of the Company s technology
offering to the customer on additional vehicle types and provide a level of confidence to encourage the customer to enter into a multi-year,
commercial arrangement with the Company in the future. Revenue on these multi-phase contracts is generally recognized at the point in
time when the performance obligations of each independent phase have been completed and customer acceptance has been acknowledged. Contracts
often allow mutual termination without penalty. To the extent our actual costs vary from the fixed fee, we will generate more or less
profit or could incur a loss. 

In addition, we derive revenue
from EAS subscriptions with relative add-on offerings such as hardware revenue and other revenue (i.e., deployment/set up costs). Revenue
from these subscriptions and add-ons are recognized monthly over the service contract life, beginning at the time that a customer acknowledges
acceptance of the service. 

During the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized 47,584 and 61,762, respectively, of revenue, substantially all related to EAS
subscriptions and hardware revenue. 

Cost of Revenue 

Cost of revenues consists
primarily of direct labor and related fringe benefits for internal engineering resources costs incurred for the completion of the contracts
and hardware costs. 

During the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported cost of revenue of 157,251 and 285,949, respectively, consisting primarily of
deployment costs, related to personnel costs, travel expenses and associated hardware costs to specific customers.

 All information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the 1-for-100 reverse stock split effected on July 3, 2024. See Note 7, Capital Structure for details. 

29 

Research and Development 

Research and development expense
consist primarily of internal engineering and development expenses, materials, labor and stock-based compensation and outsourced engineering
services related to development of the Company s products and services. Research and development costs incurred during NRE projects
are capitalized and expensed when the associated NRE revenue is recognized. All other research and development costs are expensed as incurred. 

Research and development expense
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by approximately 0.1 million or 4.6 to 2.8 million from approximately 2.9
million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable the capitalization of costs related to capitalized
software and customer contracts. 

Research and development expense
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by approximately 0.5 million or 5.6 to 9.2 million from approximately 9.7 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable the capitalization of costs related to capitalized
software and customer contracts. 

General and Administrative 

General and administrative
expense consist primarily of personnel costs, facilities expenses, depreciation and amortization, travel, and advertising costs. 

General and administrative expenses decreased by
approximately 0.1 million or 2.3 to approximately 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from approximately 2.7
million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was attributed to a decrease in consultant costs due to hiring employees
full-time, as well as decreases in insurance, professional fees and other general and administrative expenses. 

General and administrative expenses decreased by
approximately 0.7 million or 7.8 to approximately 7.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from approximately 8.6
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was attributed to a decrease in consultant costs due to hiring employees
full-time, as well as decreases in insurance, professional fees and other general and administrative expenses. 

Interest Income (Expense), net

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Company s principal
source of liquidity is its cash and current maturities of short-term investments. Short-term investments consist of placements in U.S.
government securities with original maturities between three to nine months. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had unrestricted cash
of approximately 2.0 million and short-term investments of approximately 0.8 million. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had unrestricted
cash of approximately 3.6 million and short-term investments of approximately 4.6 million. 

On May 31, 2023, the Company
entered into an ATM Sales Agreement with Virtu Americas LLC (the ATM Sales Agreement ), under which the Company may, from
time to time, sell shares of the Company s common stock at market prices by methods deemed to be an at-the-market offering 
as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The ATM Sales Agreement and related
prospectus is limited to sales of up to an aggregate maximum of 8.8 million of shares of the Company s common stock. The Company
pays Virtu Americas LLC up to 3.0 of the gross proceeds as a commission. As of September 30, 2024, a total of 424,598 shares of common
stock were sold through Virtu Americas LLC under the ATM Sales Agreement for net proceeds of 8,597,957 after payment of commission fees
of 175,468 and other related expenses of 60,465. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 0 of common stock remaining available for
sale under the ATM Sales Agreement. 

On December 8, 2023, the Company
entered into a Placement Agent Agreement with Aegis Capital Corp. Aegis ), pursuant to which Aegis acted as the Company s
placement agent, on a reasonable best efforts basis, in connection with the sale by the Company of an aggregate of 333,334 (1) 
shares of common stock in a public offering, which included: (i) 114,668 (1) shares of Common Stock, and (ii) pre-funded warrants
to purchase 218,666 (1) shares of Common Stock. The public offering closed on December 12, 2023. The Company received gross
proceeds of approximately 5 million before deducting transaction related expenses payable by the Company. All commissions, qualified
legal, accounting, registration and other direct costs of 0.5 million related to the public offering were offset against the gross proceeds. 

On April 23, 2024, the Company
entered into an underwritten Agreement with Aegis Capital Corp. Aegis ), pursuant to which Aegis acted as the Company s
underwriter on a firm commitment basis in connection with the sale by the Company of an aggregate of 500,000 (1) shares of common
stock in a public offering, which included: (i) 198,000 (1) shares of common stock, and (ii) pre-funded warrants to purchase
302,000 (1) shares of common stock. The Pre-Funded Warrants had a nominal exercise price of 0.00001. Each share of common
stock was sold at an offering price of 0.10, and each Pre-Funded Warrant was sold at an offering price of 0.09999. On May 3, the Company
closed on the sale of an additional 20,400 (1) shares of common stock, upon exercise by the underwriter of the over-allotment
option. The Company received gross proceeds of approximately 5.2 million before deducting transaction related expenses payable by the
Company. All commissions, qualified legal, accounting, registration and other direct costs of 0.6 million related to the public offering
were offset against the gross proceeds. The Company is using the net proceeds to fund its cash needs. 

The Company s liquidity
is based on its ability to enhance its operating cash flow position, obtain capital financing from equity interest investors and borrow
funds to fund its general operations, research and development activities and capital expenditures. The Company s ability to continue
as a going concern is dependent on management s ability to successfully execute its business plan, which includes increasing revenue
while controlling operating costs and expenses and obtaining funds from outside sources of financing to generate positive financing cash
flows. 

Based on cash flow projections
from operating and financing activities and the existing balance of cash and short-term investments, management is of the opinion that
the Company has insufficient funds for sustainable operations, and it may not be able to meet its payment obligations from operations
and related commitments, if the Company is not able to complete the required funding transactions to allow the Company to continue as
a going concern for the next year. Based on these factors, the Company has substantial doubt it will continue as a going concern for the
12 months following the date that these interim financial statements were issued. These condensed consolidated financial statements do
not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities
that may result in the Company not being able to continue as a going concern.

 All information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the 1-for-100 reverse stock split effected on July 3, 2024. See Note 7, Capital Structure for details.

Cash Flows 

Operating activities 

Net cash used in operating
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 15.6 million, an increase of approximately 1.1 million or
7.6 compared to approximately 14.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily attributed to increase
costs for customer deployment, an increase in inventory related to the DriveMod Kits and an increase in lease payments due to the lease
extension. 

Investing activities 

Net cash provided by investing
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 2.6 million, a decrease of approximately 3.8 million compared
to net cash provided in investing activities of approximately 6.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease
consists of smaller investment maturities of 10.6 million, which were offset by purchases of short-term investments of approximately
 6.8 million and approximately 1.3 million in purchases of R D-related hardware equipment, acquisition of intangible asset and capitalization
of software. 

Financing activities 

Cash provided by financing
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 11.4 million, which consisted of proceeds from the sale of common stock. Cash
provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was approximately 1.0 million, which consisted of proceeds
from the sale of common stock. 

Emerging Growth Company Status 

We are an emerging-growth
company , as defined in the JOBS Act, and, for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may choose to take advantage
of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to emerging growth companies, including,
but not limited to, not being required to have our independent registered public accounting firm audit our internal control over financial
reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic
reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and
stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As an emerging growth company we can also delay adopting
new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We intend to avail ourselves of these
options. Once adopted, we must continue to report on that basis until we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. 

We will cease to be an emerging
growth company upon the earliest of: (i) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the initial public offering; (ii)
the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenue are 1.07 billion or more; (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous
three-year period, issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities; or (iv) the end of any fiscal year
in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded 700 million as of the end of the second quarter
of that fiscal year. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions.
If, as a result of our decision to reduce future disclosure, investors find our common shares less attractive, there may be a less active
trading market for our common shares and the price of our common shares may be more volatile. 

We are also a smaller
reporting company , meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates plus the aggregate amount of gross proceeds
to us as a result of the IPO is less than 700 million and our annual revenue was less than 100 million during the most recently
completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates
is less than 250 million or (ii) our annual revenue was less than 100 million during the most recently completed fiscal
year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700 million. If we are a smaller reporting company at
the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are
available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company we may choose to present only the two most recent
fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting
companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Not required for smaller reporting
companies. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Management s Report on Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Our management, under the
supervision and with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer (our Chief Executive Officer) and Principal Financial Officer
(our Chief Financial Officer), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The
term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported,
within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures
include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its
principal executive and principal financial officers, or person performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

Management recognizes that
any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their
objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There has been no change in
our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

33 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

We are not currently a party
to any material legal proceedings. From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our
business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us due to defense and settlement costs, diversion of management
resources, negative publicity, reputational harm and other factors. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

Factors that could cause our actual results to
differ materially from those in this Quarterly Report are any of the risks described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in
the Form 10-K. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial
condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results
of operations. 

As of the date of this Quarterly
Report, there were no material changes to the risks and uncertainties described in the section titled Risk Factors in the
Form 10-K during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

None. 

ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES 

None. 

ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES 

Not applicable. 

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION
