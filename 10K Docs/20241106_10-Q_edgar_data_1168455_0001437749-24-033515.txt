Unrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities totaling were recorded, net of in tax benefit, as accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders' equity at December 31, 2023 . securities were sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 
 There were no transfers of available-for-sale investment securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and twelve months ended December 31, 2023 . There were securities classified as held-to-maturity at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023 . 

Investment securities with unrealized losses at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are summarized and classified according to the duration of the loss period as follows, in thousands: 

U.S. Government-sponsored agencies collateralized by mortgage obligations - residential 
 U.S. Government-agencies collateralized by mortgage obligations - commercial 
 Obligations of states and political subdivisions 

U.S. Government-sponsored agencies collateralized by mortgage obligations - residential 
 U.S. Government-agencies collateralized by mortgage obligations - commercial 
 Obligations of states and political subdivisions 

At September 30, 2024 , the Company held securities of which six were in a loss position for less than twelve months and were in a loss position for twelve months or more. Of the securities one is a U.S. Treasury security, are U.S. Government-sponsored agencies collateralized by residential mortgage obligations, were U.S. Government agencies collateralized by commercial mortgage obligations and were obligations of states and political subdivisions. The unrealized losses relate principally to market rate conditions. All of the securities continue to pay as scheduled. For available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company first assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized costs basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security's amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. At September 30, 2024 , neither of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell was met for any of the securities in an unrealized loss position. 
 
 Unrealized losses on investments in obligations of U.S. government agencies and U.S. government sponsored agencies are caused by interest rate increases. Because the decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, and because the Company does not intend to sell and more likely than not will not be required to sell, there is no allowance for credit losses recorded. 
 
 Obligations of states and political subdivisions: The unrealized losses on investments in obligations of states and political subdivisions were caused by increases in required yields by investors in these types of securities. Because the decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, and because the Company does not intend to sell and more likely than not will not be required to sell, there is no allowance for credit losses recorded.

 The Company assigns a risk rating to all loans and periodically, but not less than annually, performs detailed reviews of all criticized and classified loans over 100,000 to identify credit risks and to assess the overall collectability of the portfolio. These risk ratings are also subject to examination by independent specialists engaged by the Company and the Company s regulators. During these internal reviews, management monitors and analyzes the financial condition of borrowers and guarantors, trends in the industries in which borrowers operate and the fair values of collateral securing these loans. These credit quality indicators are used to assign a risk rating to each individual loan. 
 
 The risk ratings can be grouped into three major categories, defined as follows: 
 
 Special Mention Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position at some future date. 
 
 Substandard A substandard loan is not adequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or the value of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified as substandard have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. Well defined weaknesses include a project's lack of marketability, inadequate cash flow or collateral support, failure to complete construction on time or the project's failure to fulfill economic expectations. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
 
 Doubtful Loans classified doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently known facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. 
 
 Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above-described process are considered to be pass-rated loans. 
 
 For other loans, which are primarily consumer loans and automobile loans the Company evaluates credit quality based on the aging status of the loan and by payment activity. Non-performing loans consist of nonaccrual loans and loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing. 
 
 Other Real Estate Owned 
 
 Other real estate owned relates to real estate acquired in full or partial settlement of loan obligations. At September 30, 2024 other real estate owned totaled , consisting of one single family residential real estate (SFR) property. At December 31, 2023 other real estate owned totaled also consisting of one SFR property. There was commercial real estate loan with a balance of secured by a SFR property for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in process at September 30, 2024 and consumer mortgage loan with a balance of secured by a SFR property for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in process at December 31, 2023.

The Company places loans 90 days or more past due on nonaccrual status unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. A loan is considered to be in the process of collection if, based on a probable specific event, it is expected that the loan will be repaid or brought current. Generally, this collection period would not exceed 90 days. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status the Company's general policy is to reverse and charge against current income previously accrued but unpaid interest. Interest income on such loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is received, and future collection of principal is deemed by management to be probable. Where the collectability of the principal or interest on a loan is considered to be doubtful by management, it is placed on nonaccrual status prior to becoming 90 days delinquent.

 Of the loan commitments outstanding at September 30, 2024 , million are real estate construction loan commitments that are expected to fund within the next twelve months. The remaining commitments primarily relate to revolving lines of credit or other commercial loans, and many of these are expected to expire without being drawn upon. Therefore, the total commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Each loan commitment and the amount and type of collateral obtained, if any, are evaluated on an individual basis. Collateral held varies, but may include real property, bank deposits, debt or equity securities or business assets. The reserve for unfunded commitments at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 totaled and , respectively. 
 
 Stand-by letters of credit are conditional commitments written to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These guarantees are primarily related to the purchases of inventory by commercial customers and are typically short-term in nature. Credit risk is similar to that involved in extending loan commitments to customers and accordingly, evaluation and collateral requirements similar to those for loan commitments are used.

Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company's financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors. Those estimates that are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision are included in Level 3. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the fair values presented. 

These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering the Company's entire holdings of a particular financial instrument for sale at one time, nor do they attempt to estimate the value of anticipated future business related to the instruments. In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in any of these estimates. 
 
 The following tables present information about the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , and indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company to determine such fair value:

The fair value of securities available-for-sale equals quoted market price, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined using quoted market prices for similar securities or matrix pricing. There were no changes in the valuation techniques used during 2024 or 2023 . Transfers between hierarchy measurement levels are recognized by the Company as of the beginning of the reporting period. Changes in fair market value are recorded in other comprehensive income.

The following methods were used to estimate fair value. 
 
 Collateral-Dependent Loans: The Bank does not record loans at fair value on a recurring basis. However, from time to time, fair value adjustments are recorded on these loans to reflect partial write-downs, through charge-offs or specific reserve allowances, that are based on fair value estimates of the underlying collateral. The fair value estimates for collateral-dependent loans are generally based on recent real estate appraisals or broker opinions, obtained from independent third parties, which are frequently adjusted by management to reflect current conditions and estimated selling costs (Level 3 ). impairment charges were recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , related to the above collateral-dependent loan. Impairment charges of were recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, related to the above collateral dependent loans. The collateral-dependent loans at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consist solely of loans which have been allocated a specific credit reserve. Collateral-dependent loans consisted of one loan on September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. 
 
 Other Real Estate: Nonrecurring adjustments to certain real estate properties classified as other real estate owned are measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell. In cases where the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized. Fair values are generally based on third party appraisals of the property which are commonly adjusted by management to reflect current conditions and selling costs (Level 3 ). 
 
 Appraisals for both collateral-dependent loans and other real estate are performed by certified general appraisers (for commercial properties) or certified residential appraisers (for residential properties) whose qualifications and licenses have been reviewed and verified by the Company. Once received, a member of the Loan Administration Department reviews the assumptions and approaches utilized in the appraisal as well as the overall resulting fair value in comparison with independent data sources such as recent market data or industry-wide statistics. On a quarterly basis, the Company compares the actual selling price of similar collateral that has been liquidated to the most recent appraised value for unsold properties to determine what additional adjustment, if any, should be made to the appraisal value to arrive at fair value. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available.

 INTRODUCTION 
 
 The following discussion and analysis sets forth certain statistical information relating to the Company as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Plumas Bancorp s Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 
 There have been no changes to the Company s critical accounting policies from those disclosed in the Company s 2023 Annual Report to Shareholders on Form 10-K. 
 
 SALES/LEASEBACK AND INVESTMENT RESTRUCTURING 
 
 On January 19, 2024, Plumas Bank entered into two agreements for the purchase and sale of real property (the Sale Agreements ). One Sale Agreement provided for the sale to MountainSeed of nine properties owned and operated by Plumas Bank as branches (the Branches for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately 25.7 million. The branch portion of the sale was completed on February 14, 2024 resulting in a net gain on sale of 19.9 million, recording of right-of-use assets totaling 22.3 million and recording a lease liability of 22.3 million. The second Sale Agreement provided for the sale to MountainSeed of up to three properties operated as non-branch administrative offices (the Non-Branch Offices ). This agreement was terminated in August 2024. We continue to review opportunities for the sale of the Non-Branch Offices. 
 
 Concurrently with the closing of the sale of the branch properties, we entered into triple net lease agreements (the Lease Agreements pursuant to which Plumas Bank leased back each of the properties sold. Each Lease Agreement has an initial term of fifteen years with one 15-year renewal option. The Lease Agreements provide for an annual rent of approximately 2.4 million in the aggregate for the nine properties increased by two percent (2 per annum for each year during the initial Term. During the renewal term, the initial rent will be the basic rent during the last year of the initial term, increased by two percent (2 per annum for each year during the renewal term. 
 
 The gain on sales of the branches was offset by losses on the sale of approximately 115 million in investment securities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we sold 115 million in investment securities having a weighted average tax equivalent yield of 2.24 recording a 19.8 million loss on the sales. As part of the restructuring, beginning in December 2023 and ending on March 27, 2024, we purchased 120 million in investment securities having a weighted average tax equivalent yield of 5.25 .

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE Nine MONTHS ENDED September 30, 2024 
 
 Net Income. The Company recorded net income of 20.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, down from net income of 22.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. An increase of 2.6 million in net interest income and declines of 1.3 million in the provision for credit losses and 336,000 in the provision for income taxes were offset by a decline of 1.8 million in non-interest income and an increase of 3.9 million in non-interest expense. The annualized return on average assets was 1.69 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, down from 1.88 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The annualized return on average equity decreased from 23.3 during the first nine months of 2023 to 17.2 during the current period. 
 
 The following is a detailed discussion of each component of the change in net income. 
 
 Net interest income before provision for credit losses. Driven by an increase in market rates, growth in the loan portfolio, growth in cash balances and the restructuring of a portion of our investment portfolio partially offset by an increase in interest expense, net interest income increased by 2.6 million from 52.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 54.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in net interest income includes an increase of 8.0 million in interest income partially offset by an increase of 5.4 million in interest expense. 
 
 Interest and fees on loans increased by 5.3 million related to an increase in average balance and yield. The average balance of loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 982 million, an increase of 56 million from 926 million during the same period in 2023. The average yield on loans increased by 38 basis points from 5.83 during the first nine months of 2023 to 6.21 during the current period. 
 
 Interest on investment securities increased by 2.0 million related to an increase in yield of 67 basis points to 3.92 . The increase in investment yields is consistent with an increase in market rates and the restructuring of the investment portfolio during the first quarter of 2024. Average investment securities declined from 469 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 457 million during the current period. Interest on cash balances increased by 712 thousand related to an increase in yield of 54 basis points and an increase in average balance of 8.4 million from 88.8 million during the first nine months of 2023 to 97.2 million in the current period. Cash balances primarily relate to cash held at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (FRB). The average rate earned on FRB balances was 5.38 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 4.99 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Interest expense increased from 2.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 8.3 million during the current period related to an increase in rate paid on interest bearing liabilities and an increase in borrowings. The average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased from 0.55 during the 2023 period to 1.43 in 2024 related to an increase in borrowings and an increase in market interest rates. The average balance of borrowings increased by 107 million from 10 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 117 million during the current period. Interest incurred on borrowings totaled 4.2 million and 396 thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Interest paid on deposits increased by 1.6 million and is broken down by product type as follows: money market accounts - 556 thousand, and time deposits - 1.1 million. Related to a decline in average balance of 57 million, interest on savings deposits declined by 75 thousand. The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased from 0.49 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.85 during the current period. 
 
 Net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 6 basis points to 4.76 , up from 4.70 for the same period in 2023.

The following table presents for the nine-month periods indicated the distribution of consolidated average assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity. It also presents the amounts of interest income from interest earning assets and the resultant annualized yields expressed in both dollars and annualized yield percentages, as well as the amounts of interest expense on interest bearing liabilities and the resultant cost expressed in both dollars and annualized rate percentages. Average balances are based on daily averages. Nonaccrual loans are included in the calculation of average loans while nonaccrued interest thereon is excluded from the computation of yields earned.

Provision for credit losses. During the first nine months of 2024 we recorded a provision for credit losses of 1,346,000 consisting of a provision for credit losses on loans of 1,475,000 and a decrease in the reserve for unfunded commitments of 129,000. This compares to a provision for credit losses of 2,675,000 consisting of a provision for credit losses on loans of 2,425,000 and an increase in the reserve for unfunded commitments of 250,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As time progresses the results of economic conditions will require CECL model assumption inputs to change and further refinements to the estimation process may also be identified. See Analysis of Asset Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses for a discussion of loan quality trends and the provision for credit losses.

Non-interest income. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, non-interest income totaled 6.6 million, a decrease of 1.8 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The largest component of this decrease was a 1.7 million gain on termination of our interest rate swaps during 2023. As discussed earlier, during the first quarter of 2024, a 19.9 million gain on the sale of buildings was offset by a 19.8 million loss on sale of investment securities.

Non-interest expense. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 non-interest expense increased by 3.9 million to 31.6 million. The largest components of this increase were a 1.1 million increase in salary and benefit expenses and a 1.7 million increase in occupancy and equipment expenses. The largest increases in salary and benefit expense were 524 thousand in salary expense and 404 thousand in commission expense. These were partially offset by an increase in the deferral of loan origination costs of 297 thousand related to an increase in SBA production. The increase in occupancy and equipment costs relates to a 1.7 million increase in rent expense associated with the sales/leaseback transaction. The increase in other non-interest expense includes a 300 thousand accrual related to a litigation matter. In addition, professional fees include 265 thousand related to this matter, mostly legal fees. While portions of this matter are still being litigated these amounts represent our best estimate of potential costs to Plumas Bank related to this matter.

Provision for income taxes. The Company recorded an income tax provision of 7.5 million, or 26.4 of pre-tax income, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This compares to an income tax provision of 7.8 million, or 26.0 of pre-tax income, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The percentages for 2024 and 2023 differ from statutory rates as tax exempt items of income such as earnings on Bank owned life insurance and municipal securities interest decrease taxable income.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE three MONTHS ENDED September 30, 2024 
 
 Net Income. The Company recorded net income of 7.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, down from net income of 8.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. An increase of 1.1 million in net interest income and a decline of 200,000 in the provision for credit losses were offset by increases of 1.4 million in non-interest expense and a decline of 76,000 in non-interest income. Included in non-interest expense were nonrecurring costs related to a litigation matter totaling 376,000. The annualized return on average assets was 1.84 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, down from 2.00 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The annualized return on average equity decreased from 24.4 during the third quarter of 2023 to 18.1 during the current quarter. 
 
 The following is a detailed discussion of each component of the change in net income. 
 
 Net interest income before provision for credit losses. Net interest income was 18.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.1 million from the same period in 2023. The increase in net interest income includes an increase of 2.8 million in interest income partially offset by an increase of 1.7 million in interest expense. 
 
 Interest and fees on loans increased by 1.4 million related to growth in the loan portfolio and an increase in yield on the portfolio. Average loan balances increased by 58 million, while the average yield on these loans increased by 21 basis points from 6.00 during the third quarter of 2023 to 6.21 during the current quarter. The increase in loan yield includes an increase in SBA fixed rate loans which currently yield approximately 8.1 and the repricing of loans that are priced off the 5 year Treasury. These loans are primarily commercial real estate loans and are repriced every five years. 
 
 Interest on investment securities increased by 670 thousand related to an increase in yield of 71 basis points to 3.99 . The increase in investment yields is consistent with the increase in market rates and the restructuring of the investment portfolio during the first quarter of 2024. Average investment securities declined from 462 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 447 million during the current quarter. Interest on cash balances increased by 791 thousand related to an increase in average balance of 57 million and an increase in rate earned on these balances of 7 basis points from 5.37 during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 5.44 during the current quarter. Cash balances primarily relate to cash held at the FRB. The average rate earned on FRB balances was 5.33 during both the third quarter of 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Interest expense increased by 1.7 million from 1.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.0 million during the current period related to an increase in rate paid on interest bearing liabilities and an increase in borrowings. The average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased from 0.73 during the 2023 quarter to 1.52 in 2024 related mainly to an increase in market interest rates, and an increase in borrowings. 
 
 Interest paid on deposits increased by 391 thousand and is broken down by product type as follows: money market accounts - 266 thousand, and time deposits - 146 thousand. Related to a decline in average balance of 43 million, interest on savings deposits declined by 21 thousand. The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased from 0.69 during the third quarter of 2023 to 0.97 during the current quarter. 
 
 Mostly related to an increase in average borrowings outstanding from 10 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 117 million during the current quarter, interest incurred on borrowings increased by 1.3 million from 114 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Net interest margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 4.76 , down slightly from 4.77 for the same period in 2023.

The following table presents for the three-month periods indicated the distribution of consolidated average assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity. It also presents the amounts of interest income from interest earning assets and the resultant annualized yields expressed in both dollars and annualized yield percentages, as well as the amounts of interest expense on interest bearing liabilities and the resultant cost expressed in both dollars and annualized rate percentages. Average balances are based on daily averages. Nonaccrual loans are included in the calculation of average loans while nonaccrued interest thereon is excluded from the computation of yields earned:

Provision for credit losses. During the third quarter of 2024 we recorded a provision for credit losses of 400,000) consisting of a provision for credit losses on loans of 350,000) and a decrease in the reserve for unfunded commitments of 50,000. This compares to a provision for credit losses of 200,000) during the 2023 quarter consisting of a provision for credit losses on loans of 125,000) and a decrease in the reserve for unfunded commitments of 75,000. As time progresses the results of economic conditions will require CECL model assumption inputs to change and further refinements to the estimation process may also be identified. See Analysis of Asset Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses for a discussion of loan quality trends and the provision for credit losses. 
 
 Non-interest income. Non-interest income decreased by 76 thousand to 2.2 million during the current quarter. Increases of 29 thousand in service charge income, 21 thousand in Federal Home Loan Bank dividends and 6 thousand in other non-interest income were offset by declines in interchange income of 101 thousand, loan servicing fees of 27 thousand and earnings on insurance policies of 4 thousand. Interchange income can fluctuate period to period mostly based on the volume of debit card transactions.

Non-interest expense. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, total non-interest expense increased by 1.4 million from 9.4 million during the third quarter of 2023 to 10.8 million during the current quarter. The largest components of this increase were an increase in salary and benefit expense of 367 thousand, an increase in occupancy and equipment costs of 636 thousand, an increase in professional fees of 117 thousand and an increase in other non-interest expense of 262 thousand. The increase in salary and benefit expense primarily relates to an increase in salary expense and a decrease in the deferral of loan origination costs. Salary expenses increased by 138 thousand, which we attribute primarily to merit and promotional salary increases and an increase in employees. Our full time equivalent employee count has increased from 180 at September 30, 2023 to 189 at September 30, 2024. Deferred loan origination cost declined by 95 thousand from 694 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 599 thousand during the current period. The amount of loan origination costs deferred is primarily related to loan volume, both new originations and renewals, during the period. Occupancy and equipment costs increased by 636 thousand related to an increase in rent expense of 705 thousand mostly related to the sales/leaseback transaction completed during the first quarter of 2024. This increase in rent expense was offset by additional income resulting from the restructuring of our investment portfolio which also took place during the first quarter of 2024. The increase in other non-interest expense includes a 300 thousand accrual related to a litigation matter. In addition, professional fees include 76 thousand related to this matter, mostly legal fees. While portions of this matter are still being litigated these amounts represent our best estimate of potential costs to Plumas Bank related to this matter.

Provision for income taxes. The Company recorded an income tax provision of 2.9 million, or 26.7 of pre-tax income, for the three months ended September 30, 2024. This compares to an income tax provision of 2.8 million, or 26.3 of pre-tax income, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The percentages for 2024 and 2023 differ from statutory rates as tax exempt items of income such as earnings on Bank owned life insurance and municipal securities interest decrease taxable income.

FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 
 Total assets on September 30, 2024, were 1.6 billion, an increase of 54 million from December 31, 2023. Net loans increased by 44 million from 949 million on December 31, 2023, to 993 million at September 30, 2024. Cash and cash equivalents increased by 32 million to 118 million on September 30, 2024. Related to the sales/leaseback transaction right-of use assets increased by 22 million. These increases were offset by declines of 32 million in investment securities, 6 million in property and equipment and 6 million in all other assets. 
 
 Deposits totaled 1.4 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 17 million from December 31, 2023. Lease liabilities increased by 22 million and other liabilities increased by 1 million. Partially offsetting these increases in liabilities were decreases in borrowings and repurchase agreements. Borrowings decreased by 15 million from 90 million on December 31, 2023, to 75 million on September 30, 2024. Repurchase agreements decreased by 6 million to 17 million. Shareholders equity increased by 35 million from 147 million on December 31, 2023, to 182 million on September 30, 2024. A detailed discussion of each of these changes follows. 
 
 Loan Portfolio. Gross loans increased by 45 million, or 4 , from 959 million at December 31, 2023, to 1 billion at September 30, 2024. Increases in loans included 74 million in commercial real estate loans and 8 million in commercial loans. These items were offset by declines of 26 million in automobile loans, 8 million in agricultural loans and 3 million in all other categories. Although the Company offers a broad array of financing options, it continues to concentrate its focus on small to medium sized commercial businesses. These loans offer diversification as to industries and types of businesses, thus limiting material exposure in any industry concentrations. The Company offers both fixed and floating rate loans and obtains collateral in the form of real property, business assets and deposit accounts, but looks to business and personal cash flows as its primary source of repayment. In the fourth quarter of 2023 we terminated our indirect auto loan program. Ending this program, which was our lowest yielding loan segment, also improved our loan loss risk profile since this program had historically higher charge-off rates. Terminating this program also improved our consumer compliance risk profile. 
 
 As shown in the following table the Company's largest lending categories are commercial real estate loans, agricultural loans, commercial loans and auto loans.

The Company s real estate related loans, including real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction and land development loans, consumer equity lines of credit, and agricultural loans secured by real estate, comprised 80 of the total loan portfolio at September 30, 2024. Moreover, the business activities of the Company currently are focused in the California counties of Butte, Lassen, Modoc, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, Shasta and Sutter and in Washoe and Carson City Counties in Northern Nevada. Consequently, the results of operations and financial condition of the Company are dependent upon the general trends in these economies and, in particular, the commercial real estate markets. In addition, the concentration of the Company's operations in these areas of Northeastern California and Northwestern Nevada exposes it to greater risk than other banking companies with a wider geographic base in the event of catastrophes, such as earthquakes, fires and floods in these regions.

Commercial real estate loans CRE ), which comprised 61 of the lending portfolio at September 30, 2024, included 26 investor-owned, 26 owner-occupied, and 9 multi-family. Concentrations by real estate type within the CRE portfolio included 15 multi-family, 11 retail, 11 office, 10 mixed commercial real estate, 8 hospitality, 6 industrial, 6 special purpose, 6 gas stations and 5 mini storage facilities, with all remaining concentrations below 5 . There were no rent-controlled properties within the multi-family category. Office facilities are typically small and located in more rural areas. 28 of CRE loans were located in northern Nevada and 47 were located in northern California, including the Sacramento area. Of the 4.5 million in non-accrual balances at September 30, 2024, approximately 39 were CRE. Of the 22.4 million in substandard balances at September 30, 2024, 17 were CRE. 
 
 CRE loans consist of term loans secured by a mortgage lien on real property and include both owner occupied CRE loans as well as investor-owned loans. Investor-owned CRE loans consist of mortgage loans to finance investments in real property that may include, but are not limited to, multi-family, industrial, office, retail and other specific use properties. The primary risk characteristics in the investor-owned portfolio include impacts of overall leasing rates, absorption timelines, levels of vacancy rates and operating expenses. The Company requires collateral values in excess of the loan amounts, cash flows in excess of expected debt service requirements and equity investment in the project. The expected cash flows from all significant new or renewed income producing property commitments are stress tested to reflect the risks in varying interest rates, vacancy rates and rental rates. Inherent lending risks are monitored on a continuous basis through quarterly monitoring and the Bank s annual underwriting process, incorporating an analysis of cash flow, collateral, market conditions and guarantor liquidity, if applicable. CRE loan policies are specific to individual product types and underwriting parameters vary depending on the risk profile of each asset class. CRE loan policies are reviewed no less than annually by management and approved by the Company s Board of Directors to ensure they align with current market conditions and the Company s moderate risk appetite. CRE concentration limits have been established by product type and are monitored quarterly by the Company s Board of Directors. 
 
 The rates of interest charged on variable rate loans are set at specific increments in relation to the Company's lending rate or other indexes such as the published prime interest rate or U.S. Treasury rates and vary with changes in these indexes. The frequency in which variable rate loans reprice can vary from one day to several years. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately 77 and 78 , respectively, of the Company's loan portfolio was comprised of variable rate loans. Loans indexed to the prime interest rate were approximately 22 of the Company s variable rate loan portfolio on September 30, 2024 these loans reprice within one day to three months of a change in the prime rate. The remainder of the Company's variable rate loans mostly consist of commercial real estate loans tied to U.S. Treasury rates and reprice every five years. Approximately 75 of the variable rate loans are indexed to the five-year T-Bill rate and reprice every five years. While real estate mortgage, agricultural, commercial and consumer lending remain the foundation of the Company's historical loan mix, some changes in the mix have occurred due to the changing economic environment and the resulting change in demand for certain loan types. 
 
 Analysis of Asset Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses. The Company attempts to minimize credit risk through its underwriting and credit review policies. The Company s credit review process includes internally prepared credit reviews as well as contracting with an outside firm to conduct periodic credit reviews. The Company s management and lending officers evaluate the loss exposure of classified and nonaccrual loans on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as loan conditions change. The Management Asset Resolution Committee (MARC) reviews the asset quality of criticized and past due loans monthly and reports the findings to the full Board of Directors. In management's opinion, this loan review system helps facilitate the early identification of potential criticized loans. MARC also provides guidance for the maintenance and timely disposition of OREO properties including developing financing and marketing programs to incent individuals to purchase OREO. MARC consists of the Bank s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Credit Officer, and the activities are governed by a formal written charter. The MARC meets monthly and reports to the Board of Directors. 
 
 The allowance for credit losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of the provision for credit losses. Loan losses are charged to, and recoveries are credited to, the allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to provide for known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio. 
 
 To estimate expected losses the Company generally utilizes historical loss trends and the remaining contractual lives of the loan portfolios to determine estimated credit losses through a reasonable and supportable forecast period. Individual loan credit quality indicators including loan grade and borrower repayment performance have been statistically correlated with historical credit losses and various economic metrics including California unemployment rates, California Housing Prices and California gross domestic product. Model forecasts may be adjusted for inherent limitations or biases that have been identified through independent validation and back-testing of model performance to actual realized results. At both December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, the Company utilized a reasonable and supportable forecast period of approximately four quarters and obtained the forecast data from publicly available sources. The Company also considered the impact of portfolio concentrations, changes in underwriting practices, imprecision in its economic forecasts, and other risk factors that might influence its loss estimation process. Management believes that the allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024, appropriately reflected expected credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date. 
 
 In determining the allowance for credit losses, accruing loans with similar risk characteristics are generally evaluated collectively. The Company's policy is that loans designated as nonaccrual no longer share risk characteristics similar to other loans evaluated collectively and as such, all nonaccrual loans are individually evaluated for reserves. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank's nonaccrual loans comprised the entire population of loans individually evaluated. The Company's policy is that nonaccrual loans also represent the subset of loans in which borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty such that an evaluation of the source of repayment is required to determine if the nonaccrual loans should be categorized as collateral dependent.

The allowance for credit losses totaled 13.6 million at September 30, 2024, and 12.9 million at December 31, 2023. At least quarterly, the Company evaluates each specific reserve and if it determines that the loss represented by the specific reserve is uncollectable it records a charge-off for the uncollectable portion. Specific reserves related to collateral dependent loans totaled 26,000 and 28,000 at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.35 on September 30, 2024, and 1.34 on December 31, 2023.

The Company places loans 90 days or more past due on nonaccrual status unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. A loan is considered to be in the process of collection if, based on a probable specific event, it is expected that the loan will be repaid or brought current. Generally, this collection period would not exceed 90 days. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status the Company's general policy is to reverse and charge against current income previously accrued but unpaid interest. Interest income on such loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is received and future collection of principal is deemed by management to be probable. Where the collectability of the principal or interest on a loan is considered to be doubtful by management, it is placed on nonaccrual status prior to becoming 90 days delinquent. 
 
 Nonperforming loans at September 30, 2024 were 4.5 million, a decrease of 0.3 million from 4.8 million at December 31, 2023. 
 
 A substandard loan is not adequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or the value of the collateral pledged, if any. Total substandard loans increased by 0.7 million from 21.7 million on December 31, 2023, to 22.4 million on September 30, 2024. Loans classified as special mention increased by 4.8 million from 9.3 million on December 31, 2023, to 14.1 million on September 30, 2024. 
 
 It is the policy of management to make additions to the allowance for credit losses so that it remains appropriate to absorb the inherent risk of loss in the portfolio. Management believes that the allowance on September 30, 2024, is appropriate. However, the determination of the amount of the allowance is judgmental and subject to economic conditions which cannot be predicted with certainty. Accordingly, the Company cannot predict whether charge-offs of loans in excess of the allowance may occur in future periods.

OREO holdings represented one property totaling 141,000 on September 30, 2024, and one property totaling 357,000 at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets were 0.29 at September 30, 2024 and 0.33 at December 31, 2023.

These sales and purchases were made as part of the investment restructure described earlier. No securities were sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The investment portfolio at September 30, 2024, consisted of 4.0 million in U.S. Treasury securities, 363.1 million in securities of U.S. Government-sponsored agencies and U.S. Government agencies, and 170 municipal securities totaling 89.6 million.

The balance, on September 30, 2024, earns interest at the rate of 4.90 . 
 
 The Company classifies its investment securities as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. Currently all securities are classified as available-for-sale. Securities classified as available-for-sale may be sold to implement the Company's asset/liability management strategies and in response to changes in interest rates, prepayment rates and similar factors.

Deposits totaled 1.4 billion September 30, 2024, an increase of 17 million from December 31, 2023. The increase in deposits includes increases of 15 million in money market accounts, 11 million in time deposits and 10 million in demand deposits. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in savings deposits of 19 million. At September 30, 2024, 52 of the Company s deposits were in the form of non-interest-bearing demand deposits. The Company has no brokered deposits. 
 
 Deposits represent the Bank's primary source of funds. Deposits are primarily core deposits in that they are demand, savings and time deposits generated from local businesses and individuals. These sources are considered to be relatively stable, long-term relationships thereby enhancing steady growth of the deposit base without major fluctuations in overall deposit balances. The Company experiences, to a small degree, some seasonality with the slower growth period between November through April, and the higher growth period from May through October. To assist in meeting any funding demands, the Company maintains several borrowing agreements as described below. 
 
 Estimated uninsured deposits totaled 456 million and 416 million at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. Uninsured amounts are estimated based on the portion of the account balances in excess of FDIC insurance limits.

Repurchase Agreements. The Bank offers a repurchase agreement product for its larger customers which use securities sold under agreements to repurchase as an alternative to interest-bearing deposits. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaling 17.0 million and 23.1 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, are secured by U.S. Government agency securities with a carrying amount of 30.4 million and 34.1 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Interest paid on this product is similar to, but less than, that which is paid on the Bank s money market accounts; however, these are not deposits and are not FDIC insured. 
 
 Short-term Borrowing Arrangements. The Company is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (FHLB) and can borrow up to 240 million from the FHLB secured by commercial and residential mortgage loans with carrying values totaling 426 million. The Company is required to hold FHLB stock as a condition of membership. At September 30, 2024, the Company held 6.2 million of FHLB stock which is recorded as a component of other assets. 
 
 The Federal Reserve Board, on March 12, 2023, announced the creation of the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP). The BTFP offers loans of up to one year in length to banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other eligible depository institutions pledging U.S. Treasuries, agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, and other qualifying assets as collateral. These assets will be valued at par. At December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding borrowings under the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) totaling 80 million. In January 2024, the Company borrowed an additional 25 million under the BTFP and during September 2024 we made a 45 million payment resulting in a balance of 60 million outstanding at September 30, 2024. This borrowing bears interest at the rate of 4.85 and is payable on January 17, 2025. Borrowings under the BTFP can be prepaid without penalty. There were no borrowings under the BTFP during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense recognized on the BTFP borrowings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 3.7 million. In addition to its FHLB borrowing line and the BTFP, the Company has unsecured short-term borrowing agreements with two of its correspondent banks in the amounts of 50 million and 20 million. There were no outstanding borrowings from the FHLB or the correspondent banks at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023.

Note Payable. On January 25, 2022 the Company replaced its existing 15 million line of credit facility with a 15 million Loan Agreement (the Loan Agreement and Promissory Note (the Term Note ). The Term Note matures on January 25, 2035 and can be prepaid at any time. During the initial three years of the Loan Agreement the Term Note functions as an interest only revolving line of credit. Beginning on year four the Term Note converts into a term loan requiring semi-annual principal and interest payments and no further advances can be made. The proceeds of this lending facility shall be used by the Company for general corporation purposes, and to provide capital injections into the Bank. The Term Note bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.85 for the first 5 years and then at a floating interest rate linked to WSJ Prime Rate for the remaining eight year term. The Loan Agreement provides for a 187,500 loan fee. The Note is secured by the common stock of the Bank. The Loan Agreement contains certain financial and non-financial covenants, which include, but are not limited to, a minimum leverage ratio at the Bank, a minimum total risk-based capital ratio at the Bank, a maximum Texas Ratio at the Bank, a minimum level of Tier 1 capital at the Bank and a return on average assets needed to generate a 1.25X debt service coverage ratio. The Loan Agreement also contains customary events of default, including, but not limited to, failure to pay principal or interest, the commencement of certain bankruptcy proceedings, and certain adverse regulatory events affecting the Company or the Bank. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Loan Agreement, the Company s obligations under the Loan Agreement may be accelerated. In March 2023 the Company borrowed 10 million on this note and used the proceeds to redeem its Trust Preferred securities. During January of 2024 the Company borrowed an additional 5 million under this note for general corporate purposes. The Company was in compliance with all covenants related to the Term Note at September 30, 2024. Interest expense recognized on the Term Note for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled 477,000 and 255,000, respectively. 
 
 Capital Resources 
 
 Shareholders equity increased by 34.6 million from 147.3 million at December 31, 2023 to 181.9 million at September 30, 2024. The 34.6 million increase was related to net income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, of 20.9 million, stock option activity of 780,000 and a decrease of other comprehensive loss of 17.7 million related to the investment portfolio restructuring and a decline in market interest rates. These items were partially offset by shareholder dividends of 4.8 million. 
 
 It is the policy of the Company to periodically distribute excess retained earnings to the shareholders through the payment of cash dividends. Such dividends help promote shareholder value and capital adequacy by enhancing the marketability of the Company s stock. All authority to provide a return to the shareholders in the form of a cash or stock dividend or split rests with the Board of Directors. The Board will periodically, but on no regular schedule, review the appropriateness of a cash dividend payment. Banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of regulatory agencies. The Company is subject to various restrictions on the payment of dividends. The Company paid a quarterly cash dividend of 0.27 per share on August 15, 2024, May 15, 2024 and February 15, 2024, and a quarterly cash dividend of 0.25 per share on November 15, 2023, August 15, 2023, May 15, 2023, and February 15, 2023. 
 
 Capital Standards. The Company uses a variety of measures to evaluate its capital adequacy. Management reviews these capital measurements on a monthly basis and takes appropriate action to ensure that they are within established internal and external guidelines. The FDIC has promulgated risk-based capital guidelines for all state non-member banks such as the Bank. These guidelines establish a risk-adjusted ratio relating capital to different categories of assets and off-balance sheet exposures. 
 
 In July, 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision s capital guidelines for U.S. depository organizations, sometimes called Basel III, that increased the minimum regulatory capital requirements for bank holding companies and depository institutions and implemented strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments. The Basel III capital rules include a minimum common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5 , a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0 , a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 , and a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0 (calculated as Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets). The minimum capital levels required to be considered well capitalized include a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5 , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 , a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0 and a leverage ratio of 5.0 . In addition, the Basel III capital rules require that banking organizations maintain a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 above the minimum capital requirements in order to avoid restrictions on their ability to pay dividends, repurchase stock or pay discretionary bonuses. Including the capital conservation buffer of 2.5 , the Basel III capital rules require the following minimum ratios for a bank holding company or bank to be considered well capitalized: a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0 ; a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5 , and a total capital ratio of 10.5 . At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank s capital ratios exceeded the thresholds necessary to be considered well capitalized under the Basel III framework. 
 
 Under the FRB s Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement (the Policy Statement ), qualifying bank holding companies with less than 3 billion in consolidated assets are exempt from the Basel III consolidated capital rules. The Company qualifies for treatment under the Policy Statement and is not currently subject to the Basel III consolidated capital rules at the bank holding company level. The Basel III capital rules continue to apply to the Bank. 

40

In 2019, the federal bank regulators issued a rule establishing a community bank leverage ratio (the ratio of a bank s tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets) that qualifying institutions with less than 10 billion in assets may elect to use in lieu of the generally applicable leverage and risk-based capital requirements under Basel III. A qualifying banking organization that elects to use the new ratio will be considered to have met all applicable federal regulatory capital and leverage requirements, including the minimum capital levels required to be considered well capitalized if it maintains a community bank leverage ratio exceeding 9 . The new rule became effective on January 1, 2020. Plumas Bank has chosen not to opt into the community bank leverage ratio at this time. 

The following table sets forth the Bank's actual capital amounts and ratios (dollar amounts in thousands):

(1) Does not include amounts required to maintain the capital conservation buffer under the new capital rules. 
 
 Management believes that Plumas Bank currently meets all its capital adequacy requirements. 
 
 The current and projected capital positions of the Bank and the impact of capital plans and long-term strategies are reviewed regularly by management. The Company policy is to maintain the Bank s ratios above the prescribed well-capitalized ratios at all times. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 Loan Commitments. In the normal course of business, there are various commitments outstanding to extend credits that are not reflected in the financial statements. Commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Annual review of commercial credit lines, letters of credit and ongoing monitoring of outstanding balances reduces the risk of loss associated with these commitments. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 158.7 million in unfunded loan commitments and no letters of credit. This compares to 174.6 million in unfunded loan commitments and 108,000 in letters of credit at December 31, 2023. Of the 158.7 million in unfunded loan commitments, 95.7 million and 63.0 million represent commitments to commercial and consumer customers, respectively. Of the total unfunded commitments at September 30, 2024, 94.4 million were secured by real estate, of which 40.4 million was secured by commercial real estate and 54.0 million was secured by residential real estate mostly in the form of equity lines of credit. The commercial loan commitments not secured by real estate primarily represent business lines of credit, while the consumer loan commitments not secured by real estate primarily represent revolving credit card lines and overdraft protection lines. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 The Company manages its liquidity to provide the ability to generate funds to support asset growth, meet deposit withdrawals (both anticipated and unanticipated), fund customers' borrowing needs and satisfy maturity of short-term borrowings. The Company s liquidity needs are managed using assets or liabilities, or both. On the asset side, in addition to cash and due from banks, the Company maintains an investment portfolio which includes unpledged U.S. Government-sponsored agency securities that are classified as available-for-sale. On the liability side, liquidity needs are managed by offering competitive rates on deposit products and the use of established lines of credit. 
 
 The Company is a member of the FHLB and can borrow up to 240 million from the FHLB secured by commercial and residential mortgage loans with carrying values totaling 426 million. In addition to its FHLB borrowing line, the Company has unsecured short-term borrowing agreements with two of its correspondent banks in the amounts of 50 million and 20 million. There were no outstanding borrowings to the FHLB, or the correspondent banks at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. 
 
 Customer deposits are the Company s primary source of funds. Deposits totaled 1.4 billion September 30, 2024, an increase of 17 million from December 31, 2023. Deposits are held in various forms with varying maturities. The Company estimates that it has approximately 456 million in uninsured deposits. Of this amount, 104 million represents deposits that are collateralized such as deposits of states, municipalities and tribal accounts. 
 
 The Company s securities portfolio, Federal funds sold, FHLB advances, and cash and due from banks serve as the primary sources of liquidity, providing adequate funding for loans during periods of high loan demand. During periods of decreased lending, funds obtained from the maturing or sale of investments, loan payments, and new deposits are invested in short-term earning assets, such as cash held at the FRB, Federal funds sold and investment securities, to serve as a source of funding for future loan growth. Management believes that the Company s available sources of funds, including borrowings, will provide adequate liquidity for its operations in the foreseeable future.
