 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP in the United States requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions are based on management's best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. We adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Changes in these estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.

 We determined that the sale of the cab structures and Industrial Automation businesses represent discontinued operations as they constitute disposals of a product line and an operating segment, respectively, meet the held for sale criteria, and are a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results (individually and collectively). As a result, we reclassified the related earnings (loss) from continuing operations to earnings (loss) from discontinued operations - net of income taxes on the consolidated statement of earnings (loss) for all the periods presented. No amounts for shared general and administrative operating support expense were allocated to the discontinued operation. 
 
 The Company has continuing involvement with the cab structures business through a transition services agreement (TSA), pursuant to which the Company and Buyer parties provide certain service to each other for a period of time following the disposition, up to one year. While the transition services are expected to vary in duration depending upon the type of service provided, the Company expects to reduce costs as the transition services are completed. The Company collected a total of million related to the transition services agreement for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was recognized in Continuing operations, Other (income) expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 Key Developments 
 
 On July 31, 2024, the Company and SVO, LLC ("Buyer") entered into a purchase agreement pursuant to which the Company would sell substantially all of the assets of the Company's business of manufacturing and assembling structured products, including cabs for medium and heavy-duty vehicles, at its facility in Kings Mountain, North Carolina (the Cab Structures business). On September 6, 2024, the Company and Buyer entered into an Amendment to the Purchase Agreement whereby the transaction closed on September 6, 2024 with the Buyer paying the Company 20 million of the 40 million Purchase Price. Pursuant to the Amended Purchase Agreement, the Parties agreed (i) that the remaining 20 million of the Purchase Price would be paid on October 1, 2024, (ii) that the Assigned Contracts (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) and the employees of Seller would transfer to Buyer on October 1, 2024, and (iii) the inventory would be valued as of October 1, 2024, for purposes of determining any adjustment to the Purchase Price.The Company received the remaining portion of the Purchase Price on October 1, 2024. The net proceeds of the transaction were approximately 40 million. The Company used the proceeds for debt paydown and other general corporate purposes. The Company recorded an after-tax gain on the sale of the business of approximately 27.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 On July 30, 2024, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into Amendment No. 3, to the Credit Agreement. Amendment No. 3 amended the terms of the existing Credit Agreement to limit the mandatory prepayment requirements for certain specified asset dispositions of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. The Company repaid 20 million in accordance with Amendment No.3 during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Company announced that it has retained an investment banking firm to explore strategic alternatives for its Industrial Automation business. On October 30, 2024, the Company entered into a purchase agreement to sell its First Source Electronics (FSE) business with operations in Elkridge, Maryland for approximately 1.5 million, with a note in the amount of 500 thousand and earn out potential of an additional 1.5 million subject to certain criteria. The Elkridge facility is the primary manufacturing facility of the Company's Industrial Automation segment. CVG recorded an estimated after-tax loss on the contemplated sale of the Industrial Automation business of approximately 7.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 The cab structures and Industrial Automation segment divestitures represent a strategic shift in CVG's business and, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, qualified as discontinued operations. As a result, the operating results and cash flows related to the cab structures business and Industrial Automation segment have been reflected as discontinued operations in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The assets and liabilities that are to be sold have met the requirements to be classified within the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets under a held for sale designation. See Note 18, Discontinued Operations, for additional information on the divestitures. 
 
 Certain indirect corporate costs included within the selling, general and administrative expense caption of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations that were previously allocated to the Kings Mountain facility and Industrial Automation segment do not qualify for classification within discontinued operations and are now reported as selling, general and

 administrative expense within continuing operations on a consolidated basis and within the Corporate and other segment. CVG is implementing plans to eliminate these costs as part of its restructuring program. 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024, management approved restructuring programs to align the Company s cost structure to support margin expansion in key focus areas. The programs include workforce reductions, footprint optimization, and fundamental reorganization initiatives that were implemented to drive efficiencies and reduce operating costs in line with our go-forward business and financial objectives. We incurred 9.8 million of expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, related to these programs.

 1. Not meaningful 
 Revenues . The decrease in consolidated revenues resulted from: 
 
 a 28.4 million, or 16.8 , decrease in OEM and other revenues; 
 a 2.7 million, or 8.0 , decrease in aftermarket and OES sales; and 
 
 The decrease in revenues of 15.3 is due primarily to a softening in customer demand in our Vehicle Solutions and Electrical Systems segments. 
 
 Gross Profit . Included in gross profit is cost of revenues, which consists primarily of raw materials and purchased components for our products, wages and benefits for our employees and overhead expenses such as manufacturing supplies, facility rent and utilities costs related to our operations. The 12.9 million decrease in gross profit is primarily attributable to the impact of lower sales volumes, unfavorable mix, operational inefficiencies and increased restructuring charges. Cost of revenues decreased 18.2 million, or 10.5 , as a result of a decrease in raw material and purchased component costs of 18.0 million, or 16.9 , and a decrease in labor and overhead expenses of 0.2 million, or 0.3 . As a percentage of revenues, gross profit margin was 9.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 14.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

SG A expenses decreased 2.9 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of the gain on the sale of a building of 3.5 million, offset by increased restructuring charges. As a percentage of revenues, SG A expense was 10.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 10.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The three months ended September 30, 2024 results include charges of 0.7 million associated with restructuring programs. 
 
 Other Income . Other Income increased 1.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in other income primarily related to TSA fees of 2.0 million recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Interest Expense . Interest associated with our debt was 2.4 million and 2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in interest expense primarily related to lower average debt balances offset by higher interest rates on variable rate debt during the respective comparative periods.

As of September 30, 2024 , we had outstanding letters of credit of 1.1 million and borrowing availability of 146.3 million from our U.S. and China credit facilities. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, cash of 30.9 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. The Company had a 0.1 million deferred tax liability as of September 30, 2024 for the expected future income tax implications of repatriating cash from the foreign subsidiaries for which indefinite reinvestment is not expected.

 Covenants and Liquidity 
 
 Our ability to comply with the covenants in the Credit Agreement, as discussed in Note 4, Debt, may be affected by economic or business conditions beyond our control. Based on our current forecast, we believe that we will be able to maintain compliance with the financial maintenance covenants and the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant and other covenants in the Credit Agreement for the next twelve months; however, no assurances can be given that we will be able to comply. We base our forecasts on historical experience, industry forecasts and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. If actual results are substantially different than our current forecast, we may not be able to comply with our financial covenants. 
 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 
 (6,835) 29,990 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 
 12,868 (15,196) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 
 (12,927) 531 Effect of currency exchange rate changes on cash 
 (69) (857) Net increase (decrease) in cash (6,963) 14,468 
 
 Operating activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 6.8 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 30.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash used in operating activities is primarily attributable to a lower net income from continuing and discontinued operations, including cash used to support restructuring programs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to higher net income offset by an increase in working capital for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Investing activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by investing activities of 12.9 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of 15.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to 23.0 million proceeds from sale of the Company's cab structures and FinishTEK businesses during the current period and 4.5 million proceeds from the sale of a building. In 2024, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of 20 million to 25 million. 
 
 Financing activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was 12.9 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily attributable to the 20.0 million term loan repayment, offset by an increase in borrowings under the revolving credit facility to fund working capital.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). For a comprehensive discussion of our significant accounting policies, see "Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies", to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Critical accounting estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results. These estimates require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to estimate matters that are inherently uncertain. We review the development, selection, and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Com mittee of our board of directors. For information about critical accounting estimates, see Critical Accounting Estimates in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our 2023 Form 10-K. At September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates from those disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K.

The important factors discussed in Item 1A - Risk Factors , among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements made herein and presented elsewhere by management from time to time.

 ITEM 3 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 For information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, see the discussion under "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in our 2023 Form 10-K. As of September 30, 2024 , there have been no material changes in our exposure to market risk from those disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 ITEM 4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures . Our senior management is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. 
 
 We evaluated, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. There were no changes during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls . Our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that 
 32 

Table of Contents 

 misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of error or mistake. Controls also can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

Based upon the information available to management and discussions with legal counsel, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate outcome of the various legal actions and claims that are incidental to our business are not expected to have a material adverse impact on the consolidated financial position, results of operations, stockholders' equity or cash flows; however, such matters are subject to many uncertainties and the outcomes of individual matters are not predictable with any degree of assurance.

These risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.
