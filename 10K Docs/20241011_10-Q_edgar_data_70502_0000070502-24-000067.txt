FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended August 31, 2024 this Report contains certain statements that are considered forward-looking statements as defined in and within the meaning of the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements do not represent historical facts or statements of current conditions. Instead, forward-looking statements represent management s current beliefs and expectations, based on certain assumptions and estimates made by, and information available to, management at the time the statements are made, regarding our future plans, strategies, operations, financial results or other events and developments, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside our control. Forward-looking statements are generally identified by the use of words such as intend, plan, may, should, will, project, estimate, anticipate, believe, expect, continue, potential, opportunity and similar expressions, whether in the negative or affirmative. All statements about future expectations or projections, including statements about loan volume, the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, operating income and expenses, leverage and debt-to-equity ratios, borrower financial performance, impaired loans, and sources and uses of liquidity, are forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, actual results and performance may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement and should consider the risks and uncertainties that could cause our current expectations to vary from our forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, legislative changes that could affect our tax status and other matters, demand for our loan products, lending competition, changes in the quality or composition of our loan portfolio, changes in our ability to access external financing, changes in the credit ratings on our debt, valuation of collateral supporting impaired loans, charges associated with our operation or disposition of foreclosed assets, nonperformance of counterparties to our derivative agreements, economic conditions and regulatory or technological changes within the rural electric industry, the costs and impact of legal or governmental proceedings involving us or our members, general economic conditions, governmental monetary and fiscal policies, the occurrence and effect of natural disasters, including severe weather events or public health emergencies, and the factors listed and described under Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024 2024 Form 10-K ), as well as any risk factors identified under Part II Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Report. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the impact of events, circumstances or changes in expectations that arise after the date any forward-looking statement is made. 

INTRODUCTION 
 
 As of August 31, 2024, our financial statements included the consolidated accounts of National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation CFC and National Cooperative Services Corporation NCSC . On December 1, 2023, Rural Telephone Finance Cooperative RTFC ), which was consolidated into our financial statements in prior periods, completed the sale of its business to NCSC (hereon referred to as the RTFC sale transaction and was subsequently dissolved. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2024 Form 10-K for additional information on the RTFC sale transaction. 
 
 CFC is a member-owned, nonprofit finance cooperative association with a principal purpose of providing financing to its members to supplement the loan programs of the Rural Utilities Service RUS of the United States Department of Agriculture USDA ). CFC extends loans to its rural electric members for construction, acquisitions, system and facility repairs and maintenance, enhancements and ongoing operations to support the goal of electric distribution and generation and transmission power supply systems of providing reliable, affordable power to the customers they service. CFC also provides its members and associates with credit enhancements in the form of letters of credit and guarantees of debt obligations. As a Section 501(c)(4) tax-exempt, member-owned cooperative, CFC s objective is not to maximize profit, but rather to offer members cost-based financial products and services. The interest rates on lending products offered to our member borrowers reflect our funding costs plus a spread to cover operating expenses and estimated credit losses, while also generating sufficient earnings to cover interest owed on our debt obligations and achieve certain financial target goals.

Ta ble of Content s 

 Because CFC is a tax-exempt cooperative, we cannot issue equity securities as a source of funding. CFC s primary funding sources consist of a combination of public and private issuances of debt securities, member investments and retained equity. 
 
 NCSC is a member-owned taxable cooperative that is permitted to provide financing to two types of members: NCSC electric and NCSC telecommunication. NCSC electric members and associates consist of members of CFC, entities eligible to be members of CFC, government or quasi-government entities that own electric utility systems that meet the Rural Electrification Act definition of rural, and for-profit and nonprofit entities that are owned, operated or controlled by, or provide significant benefits to certain members of CFC. NCSC telecommunication telecom members and associates consist of rural telecommunications members and their affiliates. 
 
 Cooperative Securities LLC Cooperative Securities is a limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of NCSC. Cooperative Securities is a broker-dealer registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation. Cooperative Securities provides institutional debt placement services, which may include advising, arranging and structuring private debt financing transactions, for NCSC s members, and for-profit and not-for-profit entities that are owned, operated or controlled by, or provide a significant benefit to certain rural utility providers. 
 
 See Item 1. Business in our 2024 Form 10-K for additional information on the business structure, mission, principal purpose, members and core business activities of each of these entities. Unless stated otherwise, references to we, our or us relate to CFC and its consolidated entities. All references to members within this document include members, associates and affiliates of CFC and its consolidated entities, except where indicated otherwise. 
 
 The following MD A is intended to enhance the understanding of our consolidated financial statements by providing information that we believe is relevant in evaluating our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and the potential impact of material known events or uncertainties that, based on management s assessment, are reasonably likely to cause the financial information included in this Report not to be necessarily indicative of our future financial performance. Management monitors a variety of key indicators and metrics to evaluate our business performance. We discuss these key measures and factors influencing changes from period to period. Our MD A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Report, our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024 fiscal year 2024 included in our 2024 Form 10-K and additional information, including the risk factors discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors, contained in our 2024 Form 10-K, as well as additional information contained elsewhere in this Report. 
 
 Our fiscal year begins on June 1 and ends on May 31. References to Q1 FY2025 and Q1 FY2024 refer to three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Our reported financial results are determined in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States U.S. GAAP and are subject to period-to-period volatility due to changes in market conditions and differences in the way our financial assets and liabilities are accounted for under U.S. GAAP. Our financial assets and liabilities expose us to interest-rate risk, therefore we use derivatives, primarily interest rate swaps, to economically hedge and manage the interest-rate sensitivity mismatch between our financial assets and liabilities. We are required under U.S. GAAP to carry derivatives at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets; however, the financial assets and liabilities for which we use derivatives to economically hedge are carried at amortized cost. Changes in interest rates and the shape of the swap curve result in periodic fluctuations in the fair value of our derivatives, which may cause volatility in our earnings because we do not apply hedge accounting for our interest rate swaps. As a result, the mark-to-market changes in our interest rate swaps are recorded in earnings. The majority of our derivative portfolio consists of pay-fixed swaps with longer maturities, leading to derivative losses when interest rates decline and derivative gains when interest rates rise. This earnings volatility generally is not indicative of the underlying economics of our business, as the derivative forward fair value gains or losses recorded each period may or may not be realized over time, depending on the terms of our derivative instruments and future changes in market conditions that impact the periodic cash settlement amounts of our interest rate swaps. 
 
 Therefore, management uses non-GAAP financial measures, which we refer to as adjusted measures, to evaluate financial pe rformance. Our key non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted net income, adjusted net interest income, adjusted interest

Ta ble of Content s 

 expense, adjusted net interest yield, adjusted times interest earned ratio TIER ), adjusted debt-to-equity ratio and members equity. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures are net income, net interest income, interest expense, net interest yield, TIER, debt-to-equity ratio and CFC equity, respectively. The primary adjustments we make to calculate these non-GAAP financial measures consist of (i) adjusting interest expense and net interest income to include the impact of net periodic derivative cash settlements income (expense) amounts; (ii) adjusting net income, total liabilities and total equity to exclude the non-cash impact of the accounting for derivative financial instruments; (iii) adjusting total liabilities to exclude the amount that funds CFC member loans guaranteed by RUS, subordinated deferrable debt and members subordinated certificates; (iv) adjusting total equity to include subordinated deferrable debt and members subordinated certificates and exclude cumulative derivative forward value gains and losses and amounts of changes in the fair value included in accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI related to derivatives; and (v) adjusting CFC equity to exclude derivative forward value gains and losses and AOCI. 
 
 We believe our non-GAAP financial measures, which should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures determined in conformity with U.S. GAAP, provide meaningful information and are useful to investors because management evaluates performance based on these metrics for purposes of (i) establishing short- and long-term performance goals; (ii) budgeting and forecasting; (iii) comparing period-to-period operating results, analyzing changes in results and identifying potential trends; and (iv) making compensation decisions. In addition, certain of the financial covenants in our committed bank revolving line of credit agreements and debt indentures are based on non-GAAP financial measures, as the forward fair value gains and losses related to our interest rate swaps that are excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures do not affect our cash flows, liquidity or ability to service our debt. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the way these measures are calculated. We provide a reconciliation of our non-GAAP adjusted measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the section Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations. 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
 Reported Results 
 
 Net Income (Loss) and TIER 
 
 The table below shows our net income (loss) and TIER for the periods presented and the variance between these periods. We provide a more detailed discussion of our reported results under the section Consolidated Results of Operations. 
 
 Tab le 1: N et Income (Loss) and TIER 
 
 (Dollars in thousands) Q1 FY2025 Q1 FY2024 Change 
 Net income (loss) 
 (164,326) 228,284 (392,610) TIER (1) 
 0.54 1.72 (1.18) 
 __________________________ 
 (1) Calculated based on net income (loss) plus interest expense for the period divided by interest expense for the period. 

Q1 FY2025 versus Q1 FY2024 
 
 The variance between the net loss in Q1 FY2025 and the net income in Q1 FY2024 was primarily driven by: 
 A shift to losses from gains recorded on our derivatives portfolio of 388 million, primarily attributable to decreases in interest rates across the entire swap curve during Q1 FY2025. In comparison, the medium- and long-term swap interest rates increased during Q1 FY2024; 
 A decrease in net interest income of 3 million, attributable to a decrease in the net interest yield of 8 basis points, or 10 , to 0.69 , partially offset by an increase in average interest-earning assets of 1,816 million, or 5 ; and 
 An increase in operating and other expenses of approximately 4 million;

Ta ble of Content s 

 Partially offset by: 
 An increase in gains recorded on our investment securities of 1 million, primarily due to period-to-period market fluctuations in fair value; and 
 An increase in fee and other income of 1 million. 
 
 We recorded a provision for credit losses of 1 million f or both Q1 FY2025 and Q1 FY2024 , primarily attributable to an increase in the collective allowance due to loan portfolio growth, as discussed in greater detail under the section Consolidated Results of Operations. 
 
 The decrease in TIER for Q1 FY2025, compared to Q1 FY2024, was primarily driven by a net loss attributable to our derivative portfolio forward value change for Q1 FY2025, compared with a net income for Q1 FY2024 , as discussed above. 
 
 Debt-to-Equity Ratio 
 
 Our debt-to-equity ratio increased to 12.03 as of August 31, 2024, from 11.01 as of May 31, 2024, due to the combined impact of an increase in debt to fund loan growth and a decrease in equity resulting from our reported net loss of 164 million for Q1 FY2025 and the CFC Board of Directors authorized patronage capital retirement of 47 million in July 2024. 
 
 Non-GAAP Adjusted Results 
 
 Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted TIER 
 
 The table below shows our adjusted net income and adjusted TIER for the periods presented and the variance between these periods. Our financial goals focus on earning an annual minimum adjusted TIER of 1.10. We provide a more detailed discussion of our non-GAAP adjusted results under the section Consolidated Results of Operations.

 Q1 FY2025 versus Q1 FY2024 
 
 The slight decrease in adjusted net income was primarily driven by: 
 An increase in operating and other expenses of approximately 4 million; 
 Partially offset by: 
 An increase in adjusted net interest income of 1 million, driven by an increase in average interest-earning assets of 1,816 million, or 5 , partially offset by a decrease in the adjusted net interest yield of 5 basis points, or 5 , to 1.05 ; 
 An increase in gains recorded on our investment securities of 1 million; and 
 An increase in fee and other income of 1 million. 
 
 As discussed above, we recorded a provision for credit losses of 1 million f or both Q1 FY2025 and Q1 FY2024 , primarily attributable to an increase in the collective allowance due to loan portfolio growth. 
 
 Adjusted Debt-to-Equity Ratio 
 
 We are moving away from maintaining the internally established threshold of a 6-to-1 adjusted debt-to-equity ratio and are in the process of making changes to how we calculate and manage our adjusted debt-to-equity ratio that will allow us to continue to execute our business objectives and to sustain our current credit ratings. The adjusted debt-to-equity ratio increased to 6.32 as of August 31, 2024 from 6.24 as of May 31, 2024, due to an increase in adjusted liabilities resulting from additional borrowings to fund growth in our loan portfolio, partially offset by an increase in adjusted equity. The 
 4 

Ta ble of Content s 

 increase in adjusted equity was primarily due to our adjusted net income of 66 million for Q1 FY2025, partially offset by a decrease in equity of 47 million attributable to the CFC Board of Directors authorized patronage capital retirement in July 2024, as discussed above. 
 
 We provide a reconciliation of our non-GAAP adjusted measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures under the section Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations in this Report. 
 
 Lending and Credit Quality 
 
 We segregate our loan portfolio into segments based on the borrower member class, which consists of CFC distribution, CFC power supply, CFC statewide and associate, NCSC electric and NCSC telecom. 
 
 Loans to members totaled 35,111 million as of August 31, 2024, an increase of 569 million, or 2 , from May 31, 2024, reflecting net increases in long-term and line of credit loan s of 386 million and 183 million, respectively. Our loan portfolio composition remained unchanged from May 31, 2024 with 78 of loans outstanding to CFC distribution borrowers, 16 to CFC power supply borrowers, 3 to NCSC electric borrowers, 2 to NCSC telecom borrowers, and 1 to CFC statewide and associate borrowers as of August 31, 2024. 
 
 We believe the overall credit quality of our loan portfolio remained strong as of August 31, 2024. We had no loan charge-offs or recoveries during Q1 FY2025. W e recorded 1 million in net loan recoveries to previously charged-off loan amounts during Q1 FY2024, which resulted in an annualized net recovery rate of 0.01 for Q1 FY2024. 
 
 We had one loan totaling 49 million classified as nonperforming as of both August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024. 
 
 Our allowance for credit losses and allowance coverage ratio was 50 million and 0.14 , respectively, as of August 31, 2024, compared with 49 million and 0.14 , respectively, as of May 31, 2024. The 1 million increase in the allowance for credit losses reflected an increase in the collective allowance of 1 million during Q1 FY2025. 
 
 Financing and Liquidity 
 
 Total debt outstanding increased 448 million, or 1 , to 33,166 million as of August 31, 2024, primarily due to borrowings to fund the increase in loans to members. We issued long-term debt consisting of collateral trust bonds and notes payable to Farmer Mac, totaling 550 million at an average fixed interest rate of 5.03 with an average term of 14 years during Q1 FY2025. Outstanding dealer commercial paper of 1,089 million as of August 31, 2024 was within our quarter-end target range of 1,000 million to 1,500 million. In September 2024, we issued an aggregate principal amount of dealer medium-term notes totaling 1,000 million, of which 700 million was at an average fixed interest rate of 4.34 with an average term of three years, and 300 million was at a floating interest rate with a term of three years. Our outstanding dealer commercial paper decreased to 155 million as of September 30, 2024 as we used the proceeds from the September 2024 issuance of dealer medium-term notes to pay down outstanding dealer commercial paper. 
 
 During Q1 FY2025, Fitch Ratings Fitch affirmed CFC s credit ratings and stable outlook. 
 
 Our available liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents, investments in debt securities and availability under committed bank revolving line of credit agreements, committed loan facilities under the USDA Guaranteed Underwriter Program Guaranteed Underwriter Program ), and a revolving note purchase agreement with the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Farmer Mac ). As of August 31, 2024, our available liquidity totaled 6,950 million and was 499 million below our total scheduled debt obligations over the next 12 months of 7,449 million. In addition to our existing available liquidity, we expect to receive 1,598 million fr om scheduled long-term loan principal payments over the next 12 months. Subsequent to August 31, 2024, we executed a commitment letter for the guarantee by RUS of a 450 million loan facility from the U.S. Treasury Department s Federal Financing Bank FFB under the Guaranteed Underwriter Program. 
 
 We believe we can continue to roll over our member short-term investments of 3,328 million based on our expectation that our members will continue to reinvest their excess cash primarily in short-term investment products offered by CFC. Our members historically have maintained a relatively stable level of short-term investments in CFC. Member short-term investments in CFC have averaged 3,503 million over the last 12 fiscal quarter-end reporting periods. Our available 
 5 

Ta ble of Content s 

 liquidity as of August 31, 2024 was 2,829 million in excess of, or 1.7 times over, our total 4,121 million scheduled debt obligations over the next 12 months, excluding member short-term investments. 
 
 Outlook 
 
 Macroeconomic Outlook 
 
 In September 2024, the Federal Open Market Committee FOMC of the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds target rate by 50 basis points to 4.75 - 5.00 . The FOMC expects the U.S. economy to remain strong for the remainder of 2024, with the median projected gross domestic product GDP annual growth rate at 2.0 , a slight reduction from its June 2024 projection of 2.1 . In addition, the Federal Reserve revised lower its inflation expectations, with the Personal Consumption Expenditures PCE inflation for December 2024 now expected at +2.3 year-over-year (down from +2.6 in June). The FOMC projection for U.S. unemployment for the remainder of 2024 increased to 4.4 (from 4.0 in June). Despite a fairly positive economic outlook and inflation continuing to trend towards the 2 long-term target, the FOMC is also strongly committed to supporting maximum employment as the unemployment rate, although still low, has moved up. Updated FOMC projections now show 50 basis points of additional federal funds rate cuts for the remainder of 2024, bringing the target rate to 4.25 - 4.50 by December 31, 2024. Further, the FOMC projects additional 100 basis points in federal funds rate cuts in 2025, bringing the target rate to 3.25 - 3.50 by December 2025. Consensus market outlook for interest rates indicates declining interest rates across the yield curve for the remainder of 2024 and in 2025, with shorter-term rates expected to decline faster than longer-term rates. The U.S Treasury curve un-inverted following the September FOMC meeting, and is expected to further steepen throughout the remainder of 2024 and in 2025. 
 
 Projected Reported Results 
 
 Based on our current forecast assumptions, including the yield curve forecast noted above, we project increases in our reported net interest income and net interest yield over the next 12 months compared with the 12-month period ended August 31, 2024. See Market Risk Interest Rate Risk Assessment in this Report for an additional discussion. 
 
 Projected Non-GAAP Adjusted Results 
 
 Based on our current forecast assumptions, including the yield curve forecast noted above, we project: 
 Decreases in our adjusted net interest income and adjusted net interest yield over the next 12 months relative to the 12-month period ended August 31, 2024 , primarily due to the current yield curve assumptions and our interest-earning assets repricing faster than our interest-bearing liabilities combined with the impact of lower cost debt maturing in the near term, which will need to be refinanced at a relatively higher interest rate. See Market Risk Interest Rate Risk Assessment in this Report for an additional discussion. 
 Decreases in our adjusted net income and adjusted TIER over the next 12 months, primarily attributable to increased operating expenses and a projected decrease in adjusted net interest income. 
 Our adjusted debt-to-equity ratio is expected to stay slightly above our current level of 6.32 as of August 31, 2024, primar ily due to the projected increase in total debt outstanding to fund anticipated growth in our loan portfolio. 
 
 As stated above, we exclude the impact of unrealized derivative forward fair value gains and losses from our non-GAAP financial measures. As the majority of our swaps are long-term with an average remaining life of approximately 14 years as of August 31, 2024 , the unrealized periodic derivative forward value gains and losses are largely based on future expected changes in l onger-term interest rates, which we are unable to accurately predict for each reporting period over the next 12 months. Due to the difficulty in predicting these unrealized amounts, we are unable to provide without unreasonable effort a reconciliation of our forward-looking adjusted financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 
 
 Projected Loan Portfolio 
 
 As further described below in the Liquidity Risk Projected Near-Term Sources and Uses of Funds section, we currently anticipate net long-term loan growth of 1,542 million over the next 12 months. We also expect that our variable-rate line of credit loans outstanding will remain at approximately the current level over the same period.

 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 This section provides a comparative discussion of our consolidated results of operations between Q1 FY2025 and Q1 FY2024. Following this section, we provide a discussion and analysis of material changes between amounts reported on our consolidated balance sheets as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024. You should read these sections together with our Executive Summary Outlook in this Report where we discuss trends and other factors that we expect will affect our future results of operations. 
 
 Net Interest Income 
 
 Net interest income, which is our largest source of revenue, represents the difference between the interest income earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our net interest yield represents the difference between the yield on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities plus the impact of non-interest bearing funding. We expect net interest income and our net interest yield to fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. We do not fund each individual loan with specific debt. Rather, we attempt to minimize costs and maximize efficiency by proportionately funding large aggregated amounts of loans. 
 
 Table 3 presents average balances for each major category of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the interest income earned or interest expense incurred, and the average yield or cost. Table 3 also presents non-GAAP adjusted interest expense, adjusted net interest income and adjusted net interest yield, which reflect the inclusion of net accrued periodic derivative cash settlements expense in interest expense. We provide reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures under the section Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations in this Report.

 (4) Short-term borrowings reported on our consolidated balance sheets consist of borrowings with an original contractual maturity of one year or less. However, short-term borrowings presented in Table 3 consist of commercial paper, select notes, and daily liquidity fund notes . Short-term borrowings presented on our consolidated balance sheets related to medium-term notes, Farmer Mac notes payable and other notes payable are reported in the respective category for presentation purposes in Table 3 . The period-end amounts reported as short-term borrowings on our consolidated balances sheets, which are excluded from the calculation of average short-term borrowings presented in Table 3 , totaled 519 million and 910 million as of August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, respectively. 
 (5) Net interest spread represents the difference between the average yield on total average interest-earning assets and the average cost of total average interest-bearing liabilities. Adjusted net interest spread represents the difference between the average yield on total average interest-earning assets and the adjusted average cost of total average interest-bearing liabilities. 
 (6) Includes other liabilities and equity. 
 (7) Net interest yield is calculated based on the annualized net interest income for the period divided by total average interest-earning assets for the period. 
 (8) Represents the impact of net periodic contractual interest amounts on our interest rate swaps during the period. This amount is added to interest expense to derive non-GAAP adjusted interest expense. The average (benefit)/cost associated with derivatives is calculated based on the annualized net periodic swap settlement interest amount during the period divided by the average outstanding notional amount of derivatives during the period. The average outstanding notional amount of interest rate swaps was 7,393 million and 7,714 million for Q1 FY2025 and Q1 FY2024 , respectively. 
 (9) Adjusted interest expense consists of intere st expense plus net periodic derivative cash settlements interest income (expense) during the period. Net periodic derivative cash settlements interest income (expense) is reported in our consolidated statements of operations as a component of derivative gains (losses). Adjusted average cost is calculated based on the annualized adjusted interest expense for the period divided by total average interest-bearing liabilities during the period. 
 (10) Adjusted net interest yield is calculated based on the annualized adjusted net interest income for the period divided by total average interest-earning assets for the period. 
 
 Table 4 displays the change in net interest income between periods and the extent to which the variance for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities is attributable to (i) changes in volume, which represents the change in the average balances of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities or volume, and (ii) changes in the rate, which represents the change in the average interest rates of these assets and liabilities. The table also presents the change in adjusted net interest income between periods.

 (1) The changes for each category of interest income and interest expense represent changes in either average balances (volume) or average rates for both interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. We allocate the amount attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate to the rate variance. 
 (2) For the net periodic derivative cash settlements interest amount, the variance due to average volume represents the change in the net periodic derivative cash settlements interest amount resulting from the change in the average notional amount of derivative contracts outstanding. The variance due to average rate represents the change in the net periodic derivative cash settlements amount resulting from the net difference between the average rate paid and the average rate received for interest rate swaps during the period.

 Reported Net Interest Income 
 
 Reported net interest income of 62 million for Q1 FY2025 decreased 3 million, or 5 , from Q1 FY2024, driven by a decrease in the net interest yield of 8 basis points, or 10 , to 0.69 , partially offset by an increase in average interest-earning assets of 1,816 million, or 5 . 
 
 Average Interest-Earning Assets : The increase in average interest-earning assets of 5 was primarily attributable to the growth in average total loans of 2,020 million, or 6 , driven primarily by an increase in average long-term fixed-rate 
 10 

Ta ble of Content s 

 loans of 1,944 million and an increase in average line of credit loans of 216 million , as members continued to advance loans to fund capital expenditures and for working capital purposes. 
 
 Net Interest Yield: The decrease in the net interest yield of 8 basis points, or 10 , was primarily attributable to an increase in our average cost of borrowings of 27 basis points to 4.29 , which was partially offset by an increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets of 17 basis points to 4.69 and an increase in the benefit from non-interest bearing funding of 2 b asis points to 0.29 . Our average yield on interest-earning assets and average cost of borrowings rose mainly due to the continued high interest-rate environment since August 31, 2023.The increase in average yields on long-term fixed-rate loans was the primary driver for the increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets. Meanwhile, our average cost of borrowings increased due to the long-term debt issued at a higher interest rate after Q1 FY2024. 
 
 Adjusted Net Interest Income 
 
 Adjusted net interest income of 94 million for Q1 FY2025 increased 1 million, or 1 , from Q1 FY2024, driven by an increase in average interest-earning assets of 1,816 million, or 5 , partially offset by a decrease in the adjusted net interest yield of 5 basis points, or 5 , to 1.05 . 
 
 Average Interest-Earning Assets: The increase in average interest-earning assets of 5 during Q1 FY2025 was primarily driven by the growth in average total loans of 2,020 million, or 6 , attributable primarily to the increases in average long-term fixed-rate and line of credit loans as discussed above. 
 
 Adjusted Net Interest Yield : The decrease in the adjusted net interest yield of 5 basis points to 1.05 , was primarily attributable to an increase in our adjusted average cost of borrowings of 25 basis points to 3.91 , which was partially offset by an increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets of 17 basis points to 4.69 and an increase in the benefit from non-interest bearing funding of 3 basis points to 0.27 . The increases in both average yield on interest-earning assets and adjusted average cost of borrowings were attributable to the continued high interest-rate environment since August 31, 2023 , as discussed above. 
 
 Derivative Cash Settlements 
 
 We include the net periodic derivative cash settlements interest income (expense) amounts on our interest rate swaps in the calculation of our adjusted average cost of borrowings, which, as a result, also impacts the calculation of adjusted net interest income and adjusted net interest yield. Because our derivative portfolio consists of a higher proportion of pay-fixed swaps than receive-fixed swaps, the net periodic derivative cash settlements interest income (expense) amounts generally change based on changes in the floating interest amount received each period. When floating rates increase during the period, the floating interest amounts received on our pay-fixed swaps increase and, conversely, when floating rates decrease, the floating interest amounts received on our pay-fixed swaps decrease. We recorded net periodic derivative cash settlements interest income of 32 million for Q1 FY2025 compared with 28 million for Q1 FY2024. The increase in derivative cash settlements interest income was due to the higher net interest rates received on our pay-fixed swaps in Q1 FY2025, compared with Q1 FY2024. 
 
 See Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations in this Report for additional information on our non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. 
 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 
 Our provision for credit losses each period is driven by changes in our measurement of lifetime expected credit losses for our loan portfolio recorded in the allowance for credit losses. Our allowance for credit losses and allowance coverage ratio was 50 million and 0.14 , respectively, as of August 31, 2024. In comparison, our allowance for credit losses and allowance coverage ratio was 49 million and 0.14 , respectively, as of May 31, 2024. 
 
 We recorded a provision for credit losses of 1 million f or Q1 FY2025 , primarily from an increase in the collective allowance due to loan portfolio growth. 
 
 We recorded a provision for credit losses of 1 million for Q1 FY2024 , driven primarily by an increase of 3 million in the collective allowance, partially offset by a decrease of 1 million in the asset-specific allowance for a nonperforming CFC 
 11 

Ta ble of Content s 

 power supply loan and a recovery of 1 million attributable to additional loan payments received on previously charged-off loans during Q1 FY2024 . The increase of 3 million in the collective allowance was primarily due to loan portfolio growth and a slight decline in the overall credit quality and risk profile of our loan portfolio. 
 
 We discuss our methodology for estimating the allowance for credit losses in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Allowance for Credit Losses Current Methodology in our 2024 Form 10-K. We also provide additional information on our allowance for credit losses below under section Credit Risk Allowance for Credit Losses and Note 5 Allowance for Credit Losses in this Report. 
 
 Non-Interest Income (Loss) 
 
 Non-interest income consists of fee and other income, gains and losses on derivatives not accounted for in hedge accounting relationships and gains and losses on equity and debt investment securities, which consists of both unrealized and realized gains and losses. 
 
 Table 5 presents the components of non-interest income (loss) recorded in our consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Table 5: Non-Interest Income (Loss) 
 
 (Dollars in thousands) Q1 FY2025 Q1 FY2024 Non-interest income components: Fee and other income 5,668 4,537 Derivative gains (losses) 
 (198,325) 189,887 Investment securities gains 
 4,131 2,933 Total non-interest income (loss) 
 (188,526) 197,357 
 
 The variance in non-interest income (loss) was primarily attributable to changes in the derivative gains (losses) recognized in our consolidated statements of operation s. In addition, we experienced an increase in gains recorded on our debt and equity investment securities of 1 million for Q1 FY2025, compared with Q1 FY2024. We ex pect period-to-period market fluctuations in the fair value of our equity and debt investment securities, which we report together with realized gains and losses from the sale of investment securities in our consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Derivative Gains (Losses) 
 
 As of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, our derivatives portfolio included interest rate swap agreements not designated for hedge accounting, composed of pay-fixed swaps and receive-fixed swaps, with the benchmark variable rate for the floating rate payments based on daily compounded Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ). Additionally, treasury locks may be used to manage the interest rate risk assoc iated with future debt issuance or repricing and are typically designated as cash flow hedges. We did not have any derivatives designated as accounting hedges as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024. 
 
 The total notional amount for our interest rate swaps was 7,358 million and 7,366 million as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively. The portfolio was primarily composed of longer-dated pay-fixed swaps, which accounted for approximately 79 of the outstanding notional amount as of both August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024. Consequently, changes in medium- and longer-term swap rates generally have a more pronounced impact on the net fair value of our swap portfolio. As of August 31, 2024, the average remaining maturity of our pay-fixed and receive-fixed swaps was 17 years and two years, respectively, compared with 18 years and two years, respectively, as of May 31, 2024. 
 
 Table 6 presents the components of net derivative gains (losses) recorded in our consolidated statements of operations. Derivative cash settlements interest income (expense) represents the net periodic contractual interest amount for our interest-rate swaps during the reporting period. Derivative forward value gains (losses) represent the change in fair value of our interest rate swaps during the applicable reporting period due to changes in expected future interest rates over the remaining life of our derivative contracts.

Also refer to Note 14 Fair Value Measurement to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2024 Form 10-K for information on how we measure the fair value of our derivative instruments. 
 
 Non-Interest Expense 
 
 Non-interest expense consists of salaries and employee benefit expense, general and administrative expenses, losses on the early extinguishment of debt and other miscellaneous expenses. Table 8 presents the components of non-interest expense recorded in our consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Table 8: Non-Interest Expense 
 
 (Dollars in thousands) Q1 FY2025 Q1 FY2024 Non-interest expense components: Salaries and employee benefits (17,188) (15,874) Other general and administrative expenses (19,104) (15,629) Operating expenses (36,292) (31,503) Losses on early extinguishment of debt (22) (939) Other non-interest expense (296) (178) Total non-interest expense (36,610) (32,620) 
 
 Non-interest expense of 37 million for Q1 FY2025 increased 4 million, or 12 from Q1 FY2024, primarily attributable to an increase in operating expenses, driven by higher expenses r eco rded for salaries and employee benefits, information technology and member relations, and lower losses recorded on early extinguishment of debt. 
 
 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
 
 We recorded a net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of less than 1 million for Q1 FY2025, which represented 100 of the results of operations of NCSC , as the members of NCSC own or control 100 of the interest in its company during Q1 FY2025 . In comparison, we recorded a net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of less than 1 million for Q1 FY2024, which r epresented 100 of the results of operations of NCSC and RTFC, as the members of NCSC and RTFC own or control 100 of the interest in their respective companies during Q1 FY2024 . The fluctuations in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests are primarily due to changes in the fair value of NCSC s derivative instruments recognized in NCSC s earnings. On December 1, 2023, we completed the RTFC sale transaction to NCSC and RTFC was subsequently dissolved. 

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS 
 
 Total assets increased 310 million, or 1 , to 36,488 million as of August 31, 2024 compared with May 31, 2024, primarily due to growth in our loan portfolio. We experienced an increase in total liabilities of 521 million, or 2 , to 33,687 million as of August 31, 2024, largely due to the issuances of debt to fund the growth in our loan portfolio. Total equity decreased 211 million to 2,801 million as of August 31, 2024, attributable to our reported net loss of 164 million for Q1 FY2025 and the CFC Board of Directors authorized patronage capital retirement of 47 million during the period. 
 
 Below is a discussion of changes in the major components of our assets and liabilities during Q1 FY2025. Period-end balance sheet amounts may vary from average balance sheet amounts due to liquidity and balance sheet management activities that are intended to manage our liquidity requirements and market risk exposure in accordance with our risk appetite framework. 
 
 Loan Portfolio 
 
 We segregate our loan portfolio into segments, by legal entity, based on the borrower member class, which consists of CFC distribution, CFC power supply, CFC statewide and associate, NCSC electric and NCSC telecom. We offer both long-term 
 14 

Ta ble of Content s 

 and line of credit loans to our borrowers. Under our long-term loan facilities, a borrower may select a fixed interest rate or a variable interest rate at the time of each loan advance. Line of credit loans are revolving loan facilities and generally have a variable interest rate. We describe and provide additional information on our member classes under Item 1. Business Members and information about our loan programs and loan product types under Item 1. Business Loan and Guarantee Programs in our 2024 Form 10-K. 
 
 Loans Outstanding 
 
 Loans to members totaled 35,111 million and 34,542 million as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively. Loans to CFC distribution, power supply, and statewide and associate borrowers accounted for 95 of total loans to members as of both August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024. The increase in loans to members of 569 million, or 2 , from May 31, 2024 , was primarily attributable to net increases in long-term and line of credit loans of 386 million and 183 million, respectively. The 183 million increase in line of credit loans was primarily attributable to funding provided for higher working capital and bridge loan financing requirements from our members. We experienced increases in CFC distribution loans, CFC power supply loans, CFC statewide and associate loans, NCSC electric an d NCSC telecom loans of 419 million, 83 million, 27 million, 27 million and 13 million, respectively. 
 
 Long-term loan advances totaled 848 million during Q1 FY2025 , of which approximately 97 was provided to members for capital expenditures, 2 was provided for the refinancing of loans made by other lenders and 1 was provided for other purposes. In comparison, long-term loan advances totaled 711 million during Q1 FY2024 , of which approximately 87 was provided to members for capital expenditures and approximately 13 was provided for other purposes, primarily asset acquisitions. Of the 848 million total long-term loans advanced during the Q1 FY2025 , 774 million were fixed-rate loan advances with a weighted average fixed-rate term of eight years. In comparison, of the 711 million total long-term loans advanced during Q1 FY2024 , 659 million were fixed-rate loan advances with a weighted average fixed-rate term of 14 years. 
 
 Our aggregate loans outstanding to CFC electric distribution cooperative members relating to broadband projects, which we started tracking in October 2017, increased to an estimated 3,208 million as of August 31, 2024, from approximately 3,103 million as of May 31, 2024. 
 
 We provide information on the credit performance and risk profile of our loan portfolio below under the section Credit Risk Loan Portfolio Credit Risk in this Report. Also refer to Note 4 Loans in this Report for addition information on our loans to members. 
 
 Debt 
 
 We utilize both secured and unsecured short-term borrowings and long-term debt as part of our funding strategy and asset/liability interest rate risk management. We seek to maintain diversified funding sources, including our members, affiliates, the capital markets and other private funding sources. Our funding strategy consists of various products and programs across markets to manage funding concentrations and reduce our liquidity or debt rollover risk.

 requirements under Item 7. MD A Consolidated Balance Sheet Analysis Equity Allocation and Retirement of Patronage Capital in our 2024 Form 10-K. The amount of patronage capital allocated each year by CFC s Board of Directors is based on non-GAAP adjusted net income, which excludes the impact of derivative forward value gains (losses). We provide a reconciliation of our adjusted net income to our reported net income and an explanation of the adjustments below in Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations. 
 
 In May 2024, the CFC Board of Directors authorized the allocation of 1 million of net earnings for fiscal year 2024 to the cooperative educational fund. In July 2024, the CFC Board of Directors authorized the allocation of fiscal year 2024 adjusted net income as follows: 61 million to members in the form of patronage capital and 228 million to the members capital reserve. 
 
 In July 2024, the CFC Board of Directors also authorized the retirement of patronage capital totaling 47 million, of which 30 million represented 50 of the patronage capital allocation for fiscal year 2024, and 17 million represented the portion of the allocation from fiscal year 1999 net earnings that has been held for 25 years pursuant to the CFC Board of Directors policy. This amount was returned to members in cash in September 2024. The remaining portion of the patronage capital allocation for fiscal year 2024 will be retained by CFC for 25 years pursuant to the guidelines adopted by the CFC Board of Directors in June 2009. 

ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT 
 
 Overview 
 
 CFC has an Enterprise Risk Management ERM framework that is designed to identify, assess, monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our activities to serve the financial needs of our members. We face a variety of potential internal and external risks that can significantly affect our financial condition, liquidity position, reputation and ability to meet the expectations of our members, investors and other stakeholders. As a financial services company, the major categories of risk exposures inherent in our business activities include credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk and operational risk. These risk categories are summarized below. 
 
 Credit risk is the risk that a borrower or other counterparty will be unable to meet its obligations in accordance with agreed-upon terms. 
 
 Liquidity risk is the risk that we will be unable to fund our operations and meet our contractual financial obligations or that we will be unable to fund new loans to borrowers at a reasonable cost and tenor in a timely manner. 
 
 Market risk is the risk that changes in market variables, such as movements in interest rates, may adversely affect the match between the timing of the contractual maturities, repricing and prepayments of our financial assets and the related financial liabilities funding those assets. 
 
 Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal controls, processes, systems, human error or external events, including natural disasters or public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Operational risk also includes cybersecurity risk, compliance risk, fiduciary risk, reputational risk and litigation risk. 
 
 Effective risk management is critical to our overall operations and to achieving our primary objective of providing cost-based financial products to our rural electric members while maintaining the sound financial results required to retain our investment-grade credit ratings on our rated debt instruments. In line with this, we have established a risk-management framework designed to oversee the key risks encountered in our operations and the maximum level of risk we are prepared to undertake, known as risk tolerance. This also includes risk limits and guidelines that are in alignment with CFC s mission and strategic objectives. We provide a discussion of our risk management framework in our 2024 Form 10-K under Item 7. MD A Enterprise Risk Management and describe how we manage these risks under each respective MD A section in our 2024 Form 10-K.

 CREDIT RISK 
 
 Our loan portfolio, which represents the largest component of assets on our balance sheet, accounts for the substantial majority of our credit risk exposure. We also engage in certain nonlending activities that may give rise to counterparty credit risk, such as entering into derivative transactions to manage interest rate risk and investment in debt and equity securities. We provide additional information on our credit risk-management framework under Item 7. MD A Credit Risk Credit Risk Management in our 2024 Form 10-K. 
 
 Loan Portfolio Credit Risk 
 
 Our primary credit exposure is loans to rural electric cooperatives, which provide essential electric services to end-users, the majority of which are residential customers. We also have a limited portfolio of loans to not-for-profit and for-profit telecommunication companies. The substantial majority of loans to our borrowers are long-term fixed-rate loans with terms of up to 35 years. Long-term fixed-rate loans accounted for 87 and 88 of total loans outstanding as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively. 
 
 Because we lend primarily to our rural electric utility cooperative members, we have had a loan portfolio inherently subject to single-industry and single-obligor credit concentration risk since our inception in 1969. We historically, however, have experienced limited defaults and losses in our electric utility loan portfolio due to several factors. First, the majority of our electric cooperative borrowers operate in states where electric cooperatives are not subject to rate regulation. Thus, they are able to make rate adjustments to pass along increased costs to the end customer without first obtaining state regulatory approval, allowing them to cover operating costs and generate sufficient earnings and cash flows to service their debt obligations. Second, electric cooperatives face limited competition, as they tend to operate in exclusive territories not serviced by public investor-owned utilities. Third, electric cooperatives typically are consumer-owned, not-for-profit entities that provide an essential service to end-users, the majority of which are residential customers. As not-for-profit entities, rural electric cooperatives, unlike investor-owned utilities, generally are eligible to apply for assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA and states to help recover from major disasters or emergencies. Fourth, electric cooperatives tend to adhere to a conservative core business strategy model that has historically resulted in a relatively stable, resilient operating environment and overall strong financial performance and credit strength for the electric cooperative network. Finally, we generally lend to our members on a senior secured basis, which reduces the risk of loss in the event of a borrower default. 
 
 Below we provide information on the credit risk profile of our loan portfolio, including security provisions, credit concentration, credit quality indicators and our allowance for credit losses. 
 
 Security Provisions 
 
 Except when providing line of credit loans, we generally lend to our members on a senior secured basis. Table 12 presents, by legal entity and member class and by loan type, secured and unsecured loans in our loan portfolio as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024. Of our total loans outstanding, 91 and 92 were secured as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively.

 Credit Concentration 
 
 Concentrations of credit may exist when a lender has large credit exposures to single borrowers, large credit exposures to borrowers in the same industry sector or engaged in similar activities or large credit exposures to borrowers in a geographic region that would cause the borrowers to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions in the region. As discussed above under Credit Risk Loan Portfolio Credit Risk, because we lend primarily to our rural electric utility cooperative members, our loan portfolio is inherently subject to single-industry and single-obligor credit concentration r isk. Loans outstanding to electric utility organizations totaled 34,485 million and 33,930 million as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively, and represented approximately 98 of our total loans outstanding as of each respective date. Our credit exposure is partially mitigated by long-term loans guaranteed by RUS, which totaled 112 million and 114 million as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively. 
 
 Single-Obligor Concentration 
 
 Table 13 displays the outstanding loan exposure for our 20 largest borrowers, by legal entity and member class, as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024. Our 20 largest borrowers consisted of 13 distribution systems and seven power supp ly systems as of both August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024. The largest total exposure to a single borrower or controlled group represented approximately 1 of total loans outstanding as of both August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024.

 We entered into a long-term standby purchase commitment agreement with Farmer Mac during fiscal year 2016. Under this agreement, we may designate certain long-term loans to be covered under the commitment, subject to approval by Farmer Mac, and in the event any such loan later goes into payment default for at least 90 days, upon request by us, Farmer Mac must purchase such loan at par value. The aggregate unpaid principal balance of designated and Farmer Mac approved loans was 367 million and 370 million as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively. Loan exposure to our 20 largest borrowers covered under the Farmer Mac agreement totaled 156 million and 226 million as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively, which reduced our exposure to the 20 largest borrowers to 19 of our total loans outstanding as of each respective date. No loans have been put to Farmer Mac for purchase pursuant to this agreement. 
 
 Geographic Concentration 
 
 Although our organizational structure and mission result in single-industry concentration, we serve a geographically diverse group of electric and telecommunications borrowers throughout the U.S. The consolidated number of borrowers with loans outstanding totaled 890 and 885 as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively, located in 49 states and the District of Columbia. Of the 890 and 885 borrowers with loans outstanding as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively, 49 and 50 were electric power supply borrowers as of each respective date. Electric power supply borrowers generally require significantly more capital than electric distribution and telecommunications borrowers.

 Texas, which had 67 borrowers with loans outstanding as of both August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, accounted for the largest number of borrowers with loans outstanding in any one state as of each respective date, as well as the largest concentration of loan exposure in any one state. Loans outstanding to Texas-based borrowers totaled 5,979 million and 5,768 million as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively, and accounted for approximately 17 of total loans outstanding as of each respective date. Of the loans outstanding to Texas-based borrowers, 125 million and 126 million as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively, were covered by the Farmer Mac standby repurchase agreement, which reduced our credit risk exposure to Texas-based borrowers to 5,854 million and 5,642 million as of each respective date. See Note 4 Loans in this Report for information on the Texas-based number of borrowers and loans outstanding by legal entity and member class. 
 
 Credit Quality Indicators 
 
 Assessing the overall credit quality of our loan portfolio and measuring our credit risk is an ongoing process that involves tracking payment status, modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, nonperforming loans, charge-offs, the internal risk ratings of our borrowers and other indicators of credit risk. We monitor and subject each borrower and loan facility in our loan portfolio to an individual risk assessment based on quantitative and qualitative factors. Payment status trends and internal risk ratings are indicators, among others, of the probability of borrower default and overall credit quality of our loan portfolio. We believe the overall credit quality of our loan portfolio remained strong as of August 31, 2024. 
 
 Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 
 
 We had no loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during Q1 FY2025 and Q1 FY2024. Previous loan modification to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty totaled 3 million consisting of one NCSC telecom loan as of both August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024 , and represented less than 1 of the NCSC telecom loan portfolio a s of August 31, 2024 and 1 of the NCSC telecom loan portfolio a s of May 31, 2024. The loan received a term extension at the modification and has been performing in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement after the modification . There were no unadvanced loan commitments related to this loan.

 We classify loans as nonperforming at the earlier of the date when we determine: (i) interest or principal payments on the loan are past due 90 days or more; (ii) as a result of court proceedings, the collection of interest or principal payments based on the original contractual terms is not expected; or (iii) the full and timely collection of interest or principal is otherwise uncertain. Once a loan is classified as nonperforming, we generally place the loan on nonaccrual status. Interest accrued but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed against earnings. 
 
 We had a loan to one CFC electric power supply borrower of 49 million classified as nonperforming, which represented 0.14 of total loans outstanding as of both August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024. 
 
 Net Charge-Offs 
 
 We had no charge-offs or recoveries during Q1 FY2025. W e recorded 1 million in net loan recoveries on previously charged-off loan amounts related to two CFC electric power supply loans during Q1 FY2024, which resulted in an annualized net recovery rate of 0.01 for Q1 FY2024. Prior to the two CFC electric power supply loan defaults in fiscal years 2021 and 2022, we had not experienced any defaults or charge-offs in our electric utility and telecommunications loan portfolios since fiscal year 2013 and 2017, respectively. 
 
 Borrower Risk Ratings 
 
 As part of our management of credit risk, we maintain a credit risk rating framework under which we employ a consistent process for assessing the credit quality of our loan portfolio. We evaluate each borrower and loan facility in our loan portfolio and assign internal borrower and loan facility risk ratings based on consideration of a number of quantitative and qualitative factors. We categorize loans in our portfolio based on our internally assigned borrower risk ratings, which are intended to assess the general creditworthiness of the borrower and probability of default. Our borrower risk ratings align with the U.S. federal banking regulatory agencies credit risk definitions of pass and criticized categories, with the criticized 
 23 

Ta ble of Content s 

 category further segmented among special mention, substandard and doubtful. Pass ratings reflect relatively low probability of default, while criticized ratings have a higher probability of default. Our internally assigned borrower risk ratings serve as the primary credit quality indicator for our loan portfolio. Because our internal borrower risk ratings provide important information on the probability of default, they are a key input in determining our allowance for credit losses. 
 
 Criticized loans totaled 255 million and 249 million as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively, and represented approximately 1 of total loans outstanding as of each respective date. The increase of 6 million in criticized loans was primarily due to an increase in loans outstanding for one CFC electric distribution borrower in the special mention category during Q1 FY2025. Each of the borrowers with loans outstanding in the criticized category was current with regard to all principal and interest amounts due to us as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024. 
 
 We provide additional information on our borrower risk rating framework in our 2024 Form 10-K under Item 7. MD A Credit Risk Loan Portfolio Credit Risk Credit Quality Indicators. See Note 4 Loans of this Report for detail, by member class, on loans outstanding in each borrower risk rating category. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
 We are required to maintain an allowance based on a current estimate of credit losses that are expected to occur over the remaining contractual term of the loans in our portfolio. Our allowance for credit losses consists of a collective allowance and an asset-specific allowance. The collective allowance is established for loans in our portfolio that share similar risk characteristics and are therefore evaluated on a collective, or pool, basis in measuring expected credit losses. The asset-specific allowance is established for loans in our portfolio that do not share similar risk characteristics with other loans in our portfolio and are therefore evaluated on an individual basis in measuring expected credit losses. 
 
 Table 14 presents, by legal entity and member class, loans outstanding and the related allowance for credit losses and allowance coverage ratio as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024 and the allowance components as of each date.

 The allowance for credit losses and allowance coverage ratio was 50 million and 0.14 , respectively, as of August 31, 2024, compared with 49 million and 0.14 , respectively, as of May 31, 2024. The 1 million increase in the allowance for credit losses reflected an increase in collective allowance of 1 million primarily due to loan portfolio growth. 
 
 We discuss our methodology for estimating the allowance for credit losses under the current expected credit loss CECL model in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Allowance for Credit Losses Loan Portfolio and provide information on management s judgment and the uncertainties involved in our determination of the allowance for credit losses in MD A Critical Accounting Estimates in our 2024 Form 10-K. We provide additional information on our loans and allowance for credit losses under Note 4 Loans and Note 5 Allowance for Credit Losses of this Report. 
 
 Counterparty Credit Risk 
 
 In addition to credit exposure from our borrowers, we enter into other types of financial transactions in the ordinary course of business that expose us to counterparty credit risk, primarily related to transactions involving our cash and cash equivalents, securities held in our investment securities portfolio and derivatives. We mitigate our risk by only entering into these transactions with counterparties with investment-grade ratings, establishing operational guidelines and counterparty exposure limits and monitoring our counterparty credit risk position. We evaluate our counterparties based on certain quantitative and qualitative factors and periodically assign internal risk rating grades to our counterparties. 
 
 Cash and Investments Securities Counterparty Credit Exposure 
 
 Our cash and cash equivalents and investment securities totaled 265 million and 243 million, respectively, as of August 31, 2024. The primary credit exposure associated with investments held in our investments portfolio is that issuers will not repay principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms. Our cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions generally have an original maturity of less than one year and pursuant to our investment policy guidelines, all fixed-income debt securities, at the time of purchase, must be rated at least investment grade based on external credit ratings from at least two of the leading global credit rating agencies, when available, or the corresponding equivalent, when not available. We therefore believe that the risk of default by these counterparties is low. As of August 31, 2024, our overall counterparty credit risk was deemed to be satisfactory and not materially changed compared with May 31, 2024 . 
 
 We provide additional information on the holdings in our investment securities portfolio below under Liquidity Risk Investment Securities Portfolio and in Note 3 Investment Securities. 
 
 Derivative Counterparty Credit Exposure 
 
 Our derivative counterparty credit exposure relates principally to interest-rate swap contracts. We generally engage in over-the-counter OTC derivative transactions, which expose us to individual counterparty credit risk because these transactions are executed and settled directly between us and each counterpart y. We are exposed to the risk that an individual derivative counterparty defaults on payments due to us, which we may not be able to collect or which may require us to seek a replacement derivative from a different counterparty. This replacement may be at a higher cost, or we may be unable to find a suitable replacement. 
 
 We manage our derivative counterparty credit exposu re through diversification of our derivative positions among various counterparties and by executing derivative transactions with financial institutions that have investment-grade credit ratings and maintaining enforceable master netting arrangements with these counterparties, which allow us to net derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty. We also manage the credit risk associated with our derivative counterparties by using internal credit risk analysis, limits and a monitoring process. We had 12 active derivative counterparties with credit ratings ranging from Aa1 to Baa1 by Moody s as of both August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, and from AA- to BBB+ by 
 25 

Ta ble of Content s 

 S P as of both August 31, 2024 an d May 31, 2024. The total outstanding notional amount of derivatives with these counterparties was 7,358 million and 7,366 million as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively. The highest single derivative counterparty concentration, by outstanding notional amount, accounted for approximately 24 of the total outstanding notional amount of our derivatives as of both August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024. 
 
 While our derivative agreements include netting provisions that allow for offsetting of all contracts with a given counterparty in the event of default by one of the two parties, we report the fair value of our derivatives on a gross basis by individual contr act as either a derivative asset or derivative liability on our consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of our derivatives includes credit valuation adjustments reflecting counterparty credit risk. We e stimate our exposure to credit loss on our derivatives by calculating the replacement cost to settle at current market prices, as defined in our derivative agreements, of all outstanding derivatives in a net gain position at the counterparty level where a right of legal offset exists. We provide information on the impact of netting provisions under our master swap agreements and collateral pledged, if any, in Note 9 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Impact of Derivatives on Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe our exposure to derivative counterparty risk, at any point in time, is equal to the amount of our outstanding derivatives in a net gain position, at the individual counterparty level, which totaled 382 million and 611 million as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively. 
 
 We provide additional detail on our derivative agreements, including a discussion of derivative contracts with credit rating triggers and settlement amounts that would be required in the event of a ratings trigger, in Note 9 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities of this Report. 
 
 See Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2024 Form 10-K and Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Report for additional information about credit risks related to our business. 

LIQUIDITY RISK 
 
 We define liquidity as the ability to convert assets into cash quickly and efficiently, maintain access to available funding and roll-over or issue new debt under normal operating conditions and periods of CFC-specific and/or market stress, to ensure that we can meet borrower loan requests, pay current and future obligations and fund our operations in a cost-effective manner. We provide additional information on our liquidity risk-management framework under Item 7. MD A Liquidity Risk Liquidity Risk Management in our 2024 Form 10-K. 
 
 In addition to cash on hand and investment securities, our primary sources of funds include member loan principal repayments, committed bank revolving lines of credit, committed loan facilities under the Guaranteed Underwriter Program, a revolving note purchase agreement with Farmer Mac and proceeds from debt issuances to members and in the public capital markets. Our primary uses of funds include loan advances to members, principal and interest payments on borrowings, periodic interest settlement payments related to our derivative contracts and operating expenses. 
 
 Available Liquidity 
 
 As part of our strategy in managing liquidity risk and meeting our liquidity objectives, we seek to maintain various committed sources of funding that are available to meet our near-term liquidity needs. Table 15 presents a comparison between our available liquidity, which consists of cash and cash equivalents, our debt securities investment portfolio and amounts under committed credit facilities, as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024.

 (3) The committed facilities under the Guaranteed Underwriter Program are not revolving. 
 (4) Availability subject to market conditions. 
 
 Although as a nonbank financial institution we are not subject to regulatory liquidity requirements, our liquidity management framework includes monitoring our liquidity and funding positions on an ongoing basis and assessing our ability to meet our scheduled debt obligations and other cash flow requirements based on point-in-time metrics as well as forward-looking projections. Our liquidity and funding assessment takes into consideration amounts available under existing liquidity sources, the expected rollover of member short-term investments and scheduled loan principal payment amounts, as well as our continued ability to access the capital markets and other non-capital market related funding sources. 
 
 Liquidity Risk Assessment 
 
 We utilize several measures to assess our liquidity risk and ensure we have adequate coverage to meet our liquidity needs. Our primary liquidity measures indicat e the extent to which we have sufficient liquidity to cover the payment of scheduled debt obligations over the next 12 months. We calculate our liquidity coverage ratios under several scenarios that take into consideration various assumptions about our near-term sources and uses of liquidity, including the assumption that maturities of member short-term investments will not have a significant impact on our anticipated cash outflows. Our members have historically maintained a relatively stable level of short-term investments in CFC in the form of daily liquidity fund notes, commercial paper, select notes and medium-term notes. As such, we expect that our members will continue to reinvest their excess cash in short-term investment products offered by CFC. 
 
 Table 16 presents our primary liquidity coverage ratios as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024 and displays the calculation of each ratio as of these respective dates based on the assumptions discussed above.

 (4) Member short-term investments include commercial paper sold directly to members, selected notes, daily liquidity fund note and short-term medium-term notes sold to members. See Table 18: Short-Term Borrowings Funding Sources below for additional information. 
 
 As presented in Table 16 above, our available liquidity of 6,950 million as of August 31, 2024 was 499 million below our total scheduled debt obligations over the next 12 months of 7,449 million, consisting of short-term borrowings and long-term and subordinated debt. The short-term borrowings scheduled maturity amount consists of member investments of 3,328 million and dealer commercial paper of 1,089 million. The long-term and subordinated scheduled debt obligations over the next 12 months of 3,032 million consist of debt maturities and scheduled debt payment amounts, of which, 163 million was from member investments. 
 
 We believe we can continue to roll over our member short-term investments of 3,328 million as of August 31, 2024, based on our expectation that our members will continue to reinvest their excess cash in short-term investment products offered by CFC. As mentioned above , our members historically have maintained a relatively stable level of short-term investments in CFC. Member short-te rm investments in CFC have averaged 3,503 million over the last 12 fiscal quarter-end reporting periods. Our available liquidity as of August 31, 2024 was 2,829 million in excess of, or 1.7 times over, our total 4,121 million scheduled debt obligations over the next 12 months, excluding member short-term investments. In addition, we expect to re ceive 1,598 million from scheduled long-term loan principal payments over the next 12 months. 
 
 We expect to continue accessing the dealer commercial paper market as a cost-effective means of satisfying our incremental short-term liquidity needs. Although the intra-quarter amount of dealer commercial paper outstanding may fluctuate based on our liquidity requirements, our intent is to manage our short-term wholesale funding risk by maintaining the dealer commercial paper outstanding at each quarter-end within a range of 1,000 million to 1,500 million. To mitigate commercial paper rollover risk, we expect to continue to maintain our committed bank revolving line of credit agreements and be in compliance with the covenants of these agreements so we can draw on these facilities, if necessary, to repay dealer or member commercial paper that cannot be refinanced with similar debt. Under master repurchase agreements we have

 with our bank counter parties, we can obtain short-term funding in secured borrowing transactions by selling investment-grade corporate debt securities from our investment securities portfolio subject to an obligation to repurchase the same or similar securities at an agreed-upon price and date. 
 
 The issuance of long-term debt, which represents the most significant component of our funding, allows us to reduce our reliance on short-term borrowings, as well as effectively manage our refinancing and interest rate risk. We expect to continue to issue long-term debt in the public capital markets and under our other non-capital market debt arrangements to meet our funding needs and believe that we have sufficient sources of liquidity to meet our debt obligations and support our operations over the next 12 months. 
 
 Investment Securities Portfolio 
 
 We have an investment portfolio of debt securities classified as trading and equity securities, both of which are reported on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Our debt securities investment portfolio totaled 231 million and 281 million as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively, and is intended to serve as an additional source of liquidity. Under master repurchase agreements that we have with counterparties, we can obtain short-term funding by selling investment-grade corporate debt securities from our investment portfolio subject to an obligation to repurchase the same or similar securities at an agreed-upon price and date. Because we retain effective control over the transferred securities, transactions under these repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing agreements (i.e., secured borrowings) and not as a sale and subsequent repurchase of securities. The obligation to repurchase the securities is reflected as a component of our short-term borrowings on our consolidated balance sheets. The aggregate fair value of debt securities underlying repurchase transactions is parenthetically disclosed on our consolidated balance sheets. We had no borrowings under repurchase agreements outstanding as of both August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024; therefore, we had no debt securities in our investment portfolio pledged as collateral as of each respective date. 
 
 Our investment portfolio also included equity securities with a fair value of 12 million and 37 million as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively, consisting primarily of preferred stock securities that are not as readily redeemable, therefore, we excluded the equity securities from our available liquidity. 
 
 We provide additional information on our investment securities portfolio in Note 3 Investment Securities of this Report. 
 
 Borrowing Capacity Under Various Credit Facilities 
 
 The aggregate borrowing capacity under our committed bank revolving line of credit agreements, committed loan facilities under the Guaranteed Underwriter Program and revolving note purchase agreement with Farmer Mac totaled 18,723 million as of both August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, and the aggregate amount available for access totaled 6,454 million and 6,134 million as of each respective date. The following is a discussion of our borrowing capacity and key terms and conditions under each of these credit facilities. 
 
 Committed Bank Revolving Line of Credit Agreements Unsecured 
 
 Our committed bank revolving lines of credit may be used for general corporate purposes; however, we generally rely on them as a backup source of liquidity for our member and dealer commercial paper. The total commitment amount under the three-year facility and the four-year facility was 1,345 million and 1,455 million, respectively, resulting in a combined total commitment amount under the two facilities of 2,800 million. Under our current committed bank revolving line of credit agreements, we have the ability to request up to 300 million of letters of credit, which would result in a reduction in the remaining available amount under the facilities. 
 
 Table 17 presents the total commitment amount under our committed bank revolving line of credit agreements, outstanding letters of credit and the amount available for access as of August 31, 2024.

 We did not have any outstanding borrowings under our committed bank revolving line of credit agreements as of August 31, 2024; however, we had letters of credit outstanding of 2 million under the four -year committed bank revolving agreement as of this date. 
 
 Although our committed bank revolving line of credit agreements do not contain a material adverse change clause or rating triggers that would limit the banks obligations to provide funding under the terms of the agreements, we must be in compliance with the covenants to draw on the facilities. We have been and expect to continue to be in compliance with the covenants under our committed bank revolving line of credit agreements. As such, we could draw on these facilities to repay dealer or member commercial paper that cannot be rolled over. 
 
 Guaranteed Underwriter Program Committed Facilities Secured 
 
 Under the Guaranteed Underwriter Program, we can borrow from the FFB and use the proceeds to extend new loans to our members and refinance existing member debt. As part of the program, we pay fees, based on our outstanding borrowings, that are intended to help fund the USDA Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant program and thereby support additional investment in rural economic development projects. The borrowings under this program are guaranteed by RUS. Each advance is subject to quarterly amortization and a final maturity not longer than 30 years from the date of the advance. 
 
 As displayed in Table 15, we had accessed 8,723 million under the Guaranteed Underwriter Program and up to 1,200 million was available for borrowing as of August 31, 2024. Of the 1,200 million available borrowing amount, 750 million is available for advance through July 15, 2027 and 450 million is available for advance through July 15, 2028. We are required to pledge eligible distribution system loans or power supply system loans as collateral in an amount at least equal to our total outstanding borrowings under the Guaranteed Underwriter Program committed loan facilities, which totaled 6,315 million as of August 31, 2024. In September 2024, we executed a commitment letter for the guarantee by RUS of a 450 million loan facility from the FFB under the Guaranteed Underwriter Program. 
 
 Farmer Mac Revolving Note Purchase Agreement Secured 
 
 We have a revolving note purchase agreement with Farmer Mac under which we can borrow up to 6,000 million from Farmer Mac at any time, subject to market conditions, through June 30, 2027. The agreement has successive automatic one-year renewals beginning June 30, 2026, unless Farmer Mac provides 425 days written notice of non-renewal. 
 
 Under this agreement, we had outstanding secured notes payable totaling 3,544 million and 3,864 million as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively. We borrowed 200 million in long-term notes payable and repaid 500 million in short-term notes payable under this note purchase agreement with Farmer Mac during Q1 FY2025 . A s displayed in Table 15, the amount available for borrowing under this agreement was 2,456 million as of August 31, 2024. We are 
 30 

Ta ble of Content s 

 required to pledge eligible electric distribution system or electric power supply system loans as collateral in an amount at least equal to the total principal amount of notes outstanding under this agreement. 
 
 We provide additional information on pledged collateral below under Pledged Collateral in this section and in Note 3 Investment Securities and Note 4 Loans. 
 
 Short-Term Borrowings 
 
 Our short-term borrowings, which we rely on to meet our daily, near-term funding needs, consist of commercial paper, which we offer to members and dealers, select notes and daily liquidity fund notes offered to members, medium-term notes offered to members and dealers and funds from repurchase secured borrowing transactions. 
 
 Short-term borrowings increased 84 million to 4,417 million as of August 31, 2024, from 4,333 million as of May 31, 2024, and accounted for 13 of total debt outstanding as of each respective period. 
 
 Member investments have historically been our primary source of short-term borrowings. Table 18 displays the composition, by funding source, of our short-term borrowings as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024. As indicated in Table 18, members investments represented 75 and 77 of our outstanding short-term borrowings as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively.

 Our intent is to manage our short-term wholesale funding risk by maintaining the dealer commercial paper outstanding at each quarter-end within a range of 1,000 million to 1,500 million, although the intra-quarter amount of dealer commercial paper outstanding may fluctuate based on our liquidity requirements. Dealer commercial paper outstanding was 1,089 million and 505 million as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively. 
 
 See Note 6 Short-Term Borrowings in this Report for additional information on our short-term borrowings. 
 
 Long-Term and Subordinated Debt 
 
 Long-term and subordinated debt, which represents the most significant source of our funding, totaled 28,749 million and 28,386 million as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively, and accounted for 87 of total debt outstanding as of both dates. See Table 19 below for a summary of our long-term and subordinated debt issuances and repayments during Q1 FY2025. Subsequent to August 31, 2024, we issued an aggregate principal amount of dealer medium-term notes totaling 1,000 million. 
 
 The issuance of long-term debt allows us to reduce our reliance on short-term borrowings and effectively manage our refinancing and interest rate risk, due in part to the multi-year contractual maturity structure of long-term debt. In addition to access to private debt facilities, we also issue debt in the public capital markets. Pursuant to Rule 405 of the Securities Act, we are classified as a well-known seasoned issuer. Under our effective shelf registration statements filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), we may offer and issue the following debt securities:

 an unlimited amount of collateral trust bonds and senior and subordinated debt securities, including medium-term notes, member capital securities and subordinated deferrable debt, until October 2026; and 
 daily liquidity fund notes up to 20,000 million in the aggregate with a 3,000 million limit on the aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time until March 2025. 
 
 Although we register member capital securities and the daily liquidity fund notes with the SEC, these securities are not available for sale to the general public. Medium-term notes are available for sale to both the general public and members. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we have contractual limitations with respect to the amount of senior indebtedness we may incur.

 Pledged Collateral 
 
 Under our secured borrowing agreements, we are required to pledge loans, investment debt securities or other collateral and maintain certain pledged collateral ratios. Of our total debt outstanding of 33,166 million as of August 31, 2024, 16,948 million, or 51 , was secured by pledged loans totaling 20,891 million. In comparison, of our total debt outstanding of 32,718 million as of May 31, 2024, 17,095 million, or 52 , was secured by pledged loans totaling 21,403 million. Following is additional information on the collateral pledging requirements for our secured borrowing agreements. 
 
 Secured Borrowing Agreements Pledged Loan Requirements 
 
 We are required to pledge loans or other collateral in transactions under our collateral trust bond indentures, bond agreements under the Guaranteed Underwriter Program and note purchase agreement with Farmer Mac. Total debt outstanding is presented on our consolidated balance sheets net of unamortized discounts and issuance costs. Our collateral pledging requirements are based, however, on the face amount of secured outstanding debt, which excludes net unamortized discounts and issuance costs. However, as discussed below, we typically maintain pledged collateral in excess of the required percentage. Under the provisions of our committed bank revolving line of credit agreements, the excess collateral that we are allowed to pledge cannot exceed 150 of the outstanding borrowings under our collateral trust bond indentures, the Guaranteed Underwriter Program or the Farmer Mac note purchase agreements. 
 
 Table 21 displays the collateral coverage ratios pursuant to these secured borrowing agreements as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024.

 (2) Reflects unpaid principal balance of pledged loans. 
 (3) If there is an event of default under most of our indentures, we can only withdraw the excess collateral if we substitute cash or permitted investments of equal value. 
 
 To ensure that we do not fall below the minimum collateral coverage ratio requirement, we typically pledge loans in excess of the required amount for the following reasons: (i) our distribution and power supply loans are typically amortizing loans that require scheduled principal payments over the life of the loan, whereas the debt securities issued under secured indentures and agreements typically have bullet maturities; (ii) distribution and power supply borrowers have the option to prepay their loans; and (iii) individual loans may become ineligible for various reasons, some of which may be temporary. 
 
 We provide additional information on our borrowings, including the maturity profile, below in Liquidity Risk and additional information on pledged loans in Note 4 Loans in this Report. For additional detail on each of our debt product types, refer to Note 5 Short-Term Borrowings, Note 7 Long-Term Debt, Note 8 Subordinated Deferrable Debt and Note 9 Members Subordinated Certificates in our 2024 Form 10-K. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, we engage in financial transactions that are not presented on our consolidated balance sheets, or may be recorded on our consolidated balance sheets in amounts that are different from the full contract or notional amount of the transaction. Our off-balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of unadvanced loan commitments intended to meet the financial needs of our members and guarantees of member obligations, which may affect our liquidity and funding requirements based on the likelihood that borrowers will advance funds under the loan commitments or we will be required to perform under the guarantee obligations. We provide information on our unadvanced loan commitments in Note 4 Loans and information on our guarantee obligations in Note 11 Guarantees. 
 
 Projected Near-Term Sources and Uses of Funds 
 
 Table 23 below displays a projection of our pr imary long-term sources and u ses of funds, by quarter, over each of the next six fisc al quarters. Our projection is based on the following, which includes several assumptions: (i) the estimated issuance of long-term debt, including capital market and other non-capital market term debt, is based on our market-risk management goal of minimizing the mismatch between the cash flows from our financial assets and our financial liabilities; (ii) long-term loan scheduled amortization repayment amounts represent scheduled loan principal payments for long-term loans outstanding as of August 31, 2024 and estimated loan principal payments for long-term loan advances, plus estimated prepayment amounts on long-term loans; (iii) long-term and subordinated debt maturities consist of both scheduled principal maturity and amortization amounts and projected principal maturity and amortization amounts on term debt outstanding in each period pr esented; and (iv) long-term loan advances are based on our current projection of member demand for loans. In addition, amounts available under our committed bank revolving lines of credit, net increases in dealer commercial paper and short-term member investments are intended to serve as a backup source of liquidity.

 Financial Ratios 
 
 Our debt-to-equity ratio increased to 12.03 as of August 31, 2024, from 11.01 as of May 31, 2024, due to the combined impact of an increase in debt to fund loan growth and a decrease in equity resulting from our reported net loss of 164 million for Q1 FY2025 and the CFC Board of Directors authorized patronage capital retirements of 47 million during the period. 
 
 T he adjusted debt-to-equity ratio increased to 6.32 as of August 31, 2024 from 6.24 as of May 31, 2024, due to an increase in adjusted liabilities resulting from additional borrowings to fund growth in our loan portfolio, partially offset by an increase in adjusted equity. The increase in adjusted equity was primarily due to our adjusted net income of 66 million for Q1 FY2025, partially offset by a decrease in equity of 47 million from CFC Board of Directors authorized patronage capital retirements during the period. 
 
 Debt Covenants 
 
 As part of our short-term and long-term borrowing arrangements, we are subject to various financial and operational covenants. If we fail to maintain specified financial ratios, such failure could constitute a default by CFC of certain covenants under our committed bank revolving line of credit agreements and senior debt indentures. We were in compliance with all covenants and conditions under our committed bank revolving line of credit agreements and senior debt indentures as of August 31, 2024. 
 
 As discussed above in Introduction Non-GAAP Financial Measures, the financial covenants set forth in our committed bank revolving line of credit agreements and senior debt indentures are based on adju sted financial measures, including adjusted TIER. We provide a reconciliation of adjusted TIER and other non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this Report to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures below in Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations. See Item 7. MD A Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations in our 2024 Form 10-K for a discussion of each of our non-GAAP measures and an explanation of the adjustments to derive these measures. 

MARKET RISK 
 
 Interest rate risk represents our primary source of market risk, as interest rate-volatility can have a significant impact on the earnings and overall financial condition of a financial institution. We are exposed to interest rate risk primarily from the differences in the timing between the maturity or repricing of our loans and the liabilities funding our loans. We seek to generate stable adjusted net interest income on a sustained and long-term basis by minimizing the mismatch between the cash flows from our interest rate-sensitive financial assets and our financial liabilities. We use derivatives as a tool in matching the duration and repricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities. We provide additional information on our management of interest rate risk in our 2024 Form 10-K under Item 7. MD A Market Risk Interest Rate Risk Management. Below we discuss how we manage and measure interest rate risk. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk Assessment 
 
 Our Asset Liability Management ALM framework includes the use of analytic tools and capabilities, enabling CFC to generate a comprehensive profile of our interest rate risk exposure. We routinely measure and assess our interest rate risk exposure using various methodologies through the use of ALM models that enable us to accurately measure and monitor our interest rate risk exposure under multiple interest rate scenarios using several different techniques. Below we present two measures used to assess our interest rate risk exposure: (i) the interest rate sensitivity of projected net interest income and adjusted net interest income; and (ii) duration gap. 
 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis 
 
 We regularly evaluate the sensitivity of our interest-earning assets and the interest-bearing liabilities funding those assets and our net interest income and adjusted net interest income projections under multiple interest rate scenarios. Each month we update our ALM models to reflect our existing balance sheet position and incorporate different assumptions about forecasted changes in our balance sheet position over the next 12 months. Based on the forecasted balance sheet changes, we generate various projections of net interest income and adjusted net interest income over the next 12 months. Management 
 36 

Ta ble of Content s 

 reviews and assesses these projections and underlying assumptions to identify a baseline scenario of projected net interest income and adjusted net interest income over the next 12 months, which reflects what management considers, at the time, as the most likely scenario. As discussed under Non-GAAP Financial Measures, we derive adjusted net interest income by adjusting our reported interest expense and net interest income to include the impact of net derivative cash settlements amounts. 
 
 Our interest rate sensitivity analyses take into consideration existing interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities as of the reported balance sheet date and forecasted changes to the balance sheet over the next 12 months under management s baseline projection. As discussed in the Executive Summary Outlook section, we currently anticipate net long-term loan growth of 1,542 million over the next 12 months. We also expect that our variable-rate line of credit loans outstanding will remain at approximately the current level over the same period. T he U.S. Treasury curve gradually normalized (upward sloping) leading up to and following the September 2024 FOMC meeting, and is expected to further steepen throughout the remainder of 2024 and in 2025. 
 
 Based on our current baseline forecast assumptions, which includes a total of 225 basis points of federal funds rate cuts through August 31, 2025 , we project increases in our reported net interest income and net interest yield over the next 12 months compared to the 12-month period ended August 31, 2024. We also project decreases in our adjusted net interest income and adjusted net interest yield over the next 12 months relative to the 12-month period ended August 31, 2024, primarily due to the current yield curve assumptions and interest-earning assets repricing faster than our interest-bearing liabilities combined with the impact of lower cost debt maturing in the near term, which will need to be refinanced at a relatively higher interest rate. 
 
 Table 25 presents the estimated percentage impact that a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift of plus or minus 100 basis points in the interest rate yield curve, relative to our base case forecast yield curve, would have on our projected baseline 12-month net interest income and adjusted net i nterest income as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024. In instances where the hypothetical instantaneous interest rate shift of minus 100 basis points results in a negative interest rate, we assume an interest rate floor rate of 0 in a negative interest rate. We also present the estimated percentage impact on our projected baseline 12-month net interest income and adjusted net interest income assuming a hypothetical inverted yield curve under which shorter-term interest rates increase by an instantaneous 75 basis points and longer-term interest rates decrease by an instantaneous 75 basis points.

 (1) The actual impact on our reported and adjusted net interest income may differ significantly from the sensitivity analysis presented. 
 (2) We include net periodic derivative cash settlement interest amounts as a component of interest expense in deriving adjusted net interest income. See the section Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this Report to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. 
 
 The changes in the sensitivity measures between August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024 are p rimarily attributable to changes in the size and composition of our forecasted balance sheet, as well as changes in current interest rates and forecasted interest rates. As the interest rate sensitivity simulations displayed in Table 25 indicate, we would expect an unfavorable impact on our projected net interest income over a 12-month horizon as of August 31, 2024, under the hypothetical scenario of an instantaneous parallel shift of plus 100 basis points in the interest rate yield curve and a further inverted yield curve. However, we would expect an unfavorable impact on our adjusted net interest income over a 12-month horizon as of August 31, 2024, under the hypothetical scenario of an instantaneous parallel shift of minus 100 basis points in the interest rate yield curve.

 Duration Gap 
 
 The duration gap, which represents the difference between the estimated duration of our interest-earning assets and the estimated duration of our interest-bearing liabilities, summarizes the extent to which the cash flows for assets and liabilities are matched over time. We use derivatives in managing the differences in timing between the maturities or repricing of our interest earning assets and the debt funding those assets. A positive duration gap indicates that the duration of our interest-earning assets is greater than the duration of our debt and derivatives, and therefore denotes an increased exposure to rising interest rates over the long term. Conversely, a negative duration gap indicates that the duration of our interest-earning assets is less than the duration of our debt and derivatives, and therefore denotes an increased exposure to declining interest rates over the long term. While the duration gap provides a relatively concise and simple measure of the interest rate risk inherent on our consolidated balance sheet as of the reported date, it does not incorporate projected changes on our consolidated balance sheet. 
 
 The duration gap widened to positive 1.32 months as of August 31, 2024, from negative 1.13 months as of May 31, 2024 and was within the risk limits and guidelines established by CFC s Asset Liability Committee as of each respective date. The shift to a positive duration gap is primarily due to shorter duration liabilities funding interest-earning assets. 
 
 Limitations of Interest Rate Risk Measures 
 
 While we believe that the interest income sensitivities and duration gap measures provided are useful tools in assessing our interest rate risk exposure, there are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates. These measures should be understood as estimates rather than as precise measurements. The interest rate sensitivity analyses only contemplate certain hypothetical movements in interest rates and are performed at a particular point in time based on the existing balance sheet and, in some cases, expected future business growth and funding mix assumptions. The strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ significantly from our projections, which could cause our actual interest income to differ substantially from the above sensitivity analysis. Moreover, as discussed above, we use various other methodologies to measure and monitor our interest rate risk under multiple interest rate scenarios, which, together, provide a comprehensive profile of our interest rate risk. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses in our consolidated financial statements. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management s judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We provide a discussion of our significant accounting policies in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2024 Form 10-K. 
 
 Certain accounting estimates are considered critical because they involve significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters, and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. The determination of the allowance for expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the loans in our loan portfolio involves a significant degree of management judgment and level of estimation uncertainty. As such, we have identified our accounting policy governing the estimation of the allowance for credit losses as a critical accounting estimate. We describe our allowance methodology and process for estimating the allowance for credit losses under Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Allowance for Credit Losses Loan Portfolio in our 2024 Form 10-K. 
 
 We identify the key inputs used in determining the allowance for credit losses, discuss the assumptions that require the most significant management judgment and contribute to the estimation uncertainty and disclose the sensitivity of our allowance to hypothetical changes in the assumptions underlying the calculation of our reported allowance for credit losses under Item 7. MD A Critical Accounting Estimates in our 2024 Form 10-K. Management established policies and control procedures intended to ensure that the methodology used for determining our allowance for credit losses, including any judgments and assumptions made as part of such method, are well-controlled and applied consistently from period to period. We regularly evaluate the key inputs and assumptions used in determining the allowance for credit losses and update them, as necessary, to better reflect present conditions, including current trends in credit performance and borrower risk profile,

 portfolio concentration risk, changes in risk-management practices, changes in the regulatory environment and other factors relevant to our loan portfolio segments. We did not change our allowance methodology or the nature of the underlying key inputs and assumptions used in measuring our allowance for credit losses during the current quarter. 
 
 We discuss the risks and uncertainties related to management s judgments and estimates in applying accounting policies that have been identified as critical accounting estimates under Item 1A. Risk Factors Regulatory and Compliance Risks in our 2024 Form 10-K. We provide additional information on the allowance for credit losses under the section Credit Risk Allowance for Credit Losses and Note 5 Allowance for Credit Losses in this Report. 

RECENT ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS 
 
 Recent Accounting Changes 
 
 We provide information on recently adopted accounting standards and the adoption impact on CFC s consolidated financial statements and recently issued accounting standards not yet required to be adopted and the expected adoption impact in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. To the extent we believe the adoption of new accounting standards has had or will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity, we discuss the impact in the applicable section(s) of this MD A. 

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND RECONCILIATIONS 

As discussed above in the section Introduction Non-GAAP Financial Measures, in addition to financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management evaluates performance based on certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we refer to as adjusted financial measures. Below we provide a reconciliation of our adjusted financial measures presented in this Report to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. See Item 7. MD A Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations in our 2024 Form 10-K for a discussion of each of our non-GAAP financial measures and an explanation of the adjustments to derive these measures. 
 
 Net Income and Adjusted Net Income 
 
 Table 26 provides a reconciliation of adjusted interest expense, adjusted net interest income, adjusted total revenue and adjusted net income to the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. These adjusted financial measures are used in the calculation of our adjusted net interest yield and adjusted TIER.

 We primarily fund our loan portfolio through the issuance of debt. However, we use derivatives as economic hedges as part of our strategy to manage the interest rate risk associated with funding our loan portfolio. We therefore consider the interest income and expense incurred on our derivatives to be part of our funding cost in addition to the interest expense on our debt. As such, we add net periodic derivative cash settlements interest income and expense amounts to our reported interest expense to derive our adjusted interest expense and adjusted net interest income. We exclude unrealized derivative forward value gains and losses from our adjusted net income.

 Liabilities and Equity and Adjusted Liabilities and Equity 
 
 Table 28 provides a reconciliation between our total liabilities and total equity and the adjusted amounts used in the calculation of our adjusted debt-to-equity ratio as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024. As indicated in Table 28, subordinated debt is treated in the same manner as equity in calculating our adjusted-debt-to-equity ratio.

 Total CFC Equity and Members Equity 
 
 Members equity excludes the noncash impact of derivative forward value gains (losses) and foreign currency adjustments recorded in net income and amounts recorded in AOCI. Because these amounts generally have not been realized, they are not available to members and are excluded by the CFC Board of Directors in determining the annual allocation of adjusted net income to patronage capital, to the members capital reserve and to other member funds. Table 30 provides a reconciliation of members equity to total CFC equity as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024. We present the components of AOCI in Note 10 Equity.

We recorded immaterial losses on the sale of these loa ns attributable to the unamortized deferred loan origination costs associated with the transferred loans . We had loans held for sale as of August 31, 2024. We had loans held for sale totaling million as of May 31, 2024, which were sold at par for cash during Q1 FY2025. 
 
 Accrued Interest Receivable 
 
 We report accrued interest on loans separately on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of the line item accrued interest receivable rather than as a component of loans to members. Accrued interest on loans total ed million and million as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively. Accrued interest receivable amounts generally represent three months or less of accrued interest on loans outstanding. Because our policy is to write off past-due accrued interest receivable in a timely manner, we elected not to measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivable on loans outstanding. We also elected to exclude accrued interest receivable from the credit quality disclosures required under CECL. 
 
 Credit Concentration 
 
 Concentrations of credit may exist when a lender has large credit exposures to single borrowers, large credit exposures to borrowers in the same industry sector or engaged in similar activities or large credit exposures to borrowers in a geographic region that would cause the borrowers to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions in the region. As a tax-exempt, member-owned finance cooperative, CFC s principal focus is to provide funding to its rural electric utility cooperative members to assist them in acquiring, constructing and operating electric distribution systems, power supply systems and related facilities. 
 
 Because we lend primarily to our rural electric utility cooperative members, we have had a loan portfolio subject to single-industry and single-obligor concentration risks since our inception in 1969. Loans outstanding to electric utility organizations of million and million as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively, accounted for of total loans outstanding as of each respective date. The remaining loans outstanding in our portfolio were to members, affiliates and associates in the telecommunications industry. Our credit exposure is partially mitigated by long-term loans guaranteed by RUS, which totaled million an d million as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively. 
 
 Single-Obligor Concentration 
 
 The outstanding loan exposure for o ur largest borrowers totaled million and million as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively, representing of total loans outstanding as of each respective date. Our largest borrowers consisted of distribution systems and power supp ly systems as of both August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024. The largest total outstanding exposure to a single borrower or controlled group represented approximately of total loans outstanding as of both August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024.

 million and million as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively. Loan exposure to our largest borrowers covered under the Fa rmer Mac agreement totaled million and million as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively, which reduced our exposure to the largest borro wers to of our total loans outstanding as of each respective date. We have had loan defaults for loans covered under this agreement; therefore, loa ns have been put to Farmer Mac for purchase pursuant to the standby purchase agreement as of August 31, 2024. Our credit exposure is also mitigated by long-term loans guaranteed by RUS. 
 
 Geographic Concentration 
 
 Although our organizational structure and mission result in single-industry concentration, we serve a geographically diverse group of electric and telecommunications borrowers throughout the U.S. The consolidated number of borrowers with loans outstanding totaled and a s of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively, located in states and the District of Columbia. Of the and borrowers with loans outstanding, and were electric power supply borrowers as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively. Electric power supply borrowers generally require significantly more capital than electric distribution and telecommunications borrowers. 
 
 Texas accounted for the largest number of borrowers with loans outstanding in any one state as of both August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, as well as the largest concentration of loan exposure.

 Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 
 
 We actively monitor problem loans and, from time to time, attempt to work with borrowers to manage such exposures through loan workouts or modifications that better align with the borrower s current ability to pay. Therefore, as part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may provide modifications to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty to improve long-term collectability of the loan and to avoid the need for exercising remedies. We consider the impact of all loan modifications when estimating the credit quality of our loan portfolio and establishing the allowance for credit losses. 
 
 We had loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during Q1 FY2025 and Q1 FY2024. Previous loan modification to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty totaled million consisting of NCSC telecom loan as of both August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024 , and represented less than of the NCSC telecom loan portfolio a s of August 31, 2024 and of the NCSC telecom loan portfolio a s of May 31, 2024.

 Criticized loans totaled million and million as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively, and represented approxima tely of total loans outstanding as of each respective date. The increase of million in criticized loans was primarily due to an increase in loans outstanding for CFC electric distribution borrower in the special mention category during Q1 FY2025 .

 Long-term loans Total 
 
 Unadvanced line of credit commitments accounted for of total unadvanced loan commitments as of August 31, 2024. Unadvanced line of credit commitments are typically revolving facilities for periods not to exceed and generally serve as supplemental back-up liquidity to our borrowers. Historically, borrowers have not drawn the full commitment amount for line of credit facilities, and we have experienced a very low utilization rate on line of credit loan facilities regardless of whether or not we are obligated to fund the facility when a material adverse change has occurred. 
 
 Because we historically have experienced a very low utilization rate on line of credit loan facilities, which account for the majority of our total unadvanced loan commitments, we believe the unadvanced loan commitment total of million as of August 31, 2024 is not necessarily representative of our future funding requirements. 
 
 Our unadvanced long-term loan commitments typically have a draw period under which a borrower may draw funds prior to the expiration of the commitment. We expect that the majority of the long-term unadvanced loan commitme nts of million will be advanced prior to the expiration of the commitment. 
 
 Unadvanced Loan Co mmitments Conditional 
 
 The substantial majority of our line of credit commitments and all of our unadvanced long-term loan commitments include material adverse change clauses. Unadvanced loan commitments subject to material adverse change clauses totaled million and million as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively. Prior to making an advance on these facilities, we confirm that there has been no material adverse change in the business or condition, financial or otherwi se, of the borrower since the time the loan was approved and confirm that the borrower is currently in compliance with loan terms and conditions. In some cases, the borrower s access to the full amount of the facility is further constrained by the designated purpose, imposition of borrower-specific restrictions or by additional conditions that must be met prior to advancing funds. 
 
 Unadvanced Loan Commitments Unconditional 
 
 Unadvanced loan commitments not subject to material adverse change clauses at the time of each advance consisted of unadvanced committed lines of credit t otaling million and million as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively. We are required to advance amounts on these committed facilities as long as the borrower is in compliance with the terms and conditions of the facility.

 Reserve for Credit Losses Unadvanced Loan Commitments 
 
 In addition to the allowance for credit losses for our loan portfolio, we maintain an allowance for credit losses for unadvanced loan commitments, which we refer to as our reserve for credit losses because this amount is reported as a component of other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We measure the reserve for credit losses for unadvanced loan commitments based on expected credit losses over the contractual period of our exposure to credit risk arising from our obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by us. The reserve for credit losses related to our off-balance sheet exposure for unadvanced loan commitments was less than million as of both August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024.

 Impact of Derivatives on Consolidated Statements of Operations 
 
 The primary factors affecting the fair value of our derivatives and the derivative gains (losses) recorded in our consolidated statements of operations include changes in interest rates, the shape of the swap curve and the composition of our derivative portfolio. We generally record derivative losses when interest rates decline and derivative gains when interest rates rise, as our derivative portfolio consists of a higher proportion of pay-fixed swaps than receive-fixed swaps.

 Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features 
 
 Our derivative contracts typically contain mutual early-termination provisions, generally in the form of a credit rating trigger. Under the mutual credit rating trigger provisions, either counterparty may, but is not obligated to, terminate and settle the agreement if the credit rating of the other counterparty falls below a level specified in the agreement. If a derivative contract is terminated, the amount to be received or paid by us would be equal to the prevailing fair value, as defined in the agreement, as of the termination date.

 counterparty that are subject to a ratings trigger and early termination provision in the event of a downgrade of CFC s senior unsecured credit ratings below Baa3, BBB- or BBB- by Moody s, S P or Fitch, respectively. The outstanding notional amount of these swaps, which is not included in the above table, totaled million as of August 31, 2024. These swaps were in an unrealized gain position of million as of August 31, 2024. 
 
 The aggregate fair value amount, including the credit valuation adjustment, of all interest rate swaps with rating triggers that were in a net liability position was million as of August 31, 2024. 
 
 Derivative Counterparty Credit Exposure 
 
 Our interest-rate swap contracts are subject to credit risk associated with counterparties to these derivative contracts. As mentioned above, we generally engage in OTC derivative transactions, which expose us to individual counterparty credit risk because these transactions are executed and settled directly between us and each counterparty. To manage this risk, we diversify our derivative positions among counterparties with investment-grade credit ratings, perform an internal credit risk analysis and maintain enforceable master netting arrangements, allowing us to net derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty. The fair value of our derivatives includes credit valuation adjustments reflecting counterparty credit risk. 
 
 We had active derivative counterparties with credit ratings ranging from Aa1 to Baa1 by Moody s as of both August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, and from AA- to BBB+ by S P as of both August 31, 2024 an d May 31, 2024. Our largest counterparty exposure, based on the outstanding notional amount, accounted for approximately of the total outstanding notional amount of our derivatives as of both August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024. We believe our exposure to derivative counterparty risk, at any point in time, is equal to the amount of our outstanding derivatives in a net gain position, at the individual counterparty level based on the legally enforceable netting provisions under our master swap agreements, which totaled million and million as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively, as presented in Table 9.3 above. 

million to million as of August 31, 2024 compared to May 31, 2024. The decrease was attributable primarily to the combined impact of our reported net loss of million for Q1 FY2025 and the CFC Board of Directors authorized patronage capital retirements of million during the period, as discussed below. 
 
 Allocation of Net Earnings and Retirement of Patronage Capital 
 
 The amount of patronage capital allocated each year by CFC s Board of Directors is based on adjusted net income, which excludes the impact of derivative forward value gains (losses). See MD A Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations in this Report for information on adjusted net income. In May 2024, the CFC Board of Directors authorized the allocation of million of net earnings for fiscal year 2024 to the cooperative educational fund. In July 2024, the CFC Board of Directors authorized the allocation of net earnings for fiscal year 2024 as follows: million to members in the form of patronage capital and million to the members capital reserve. 
 
 In July 2024, the CFC Board of Directors also authorized the retirement of allocated net earnings totaling million, of which million represented of the patronage capital allocation for fiscal year 2024 and million represented the portion of the allocation from net earnings for fiscal year 1999 that had been held for years pursuant to the CFC Board of Directors polic y. The authorized patronage capital retirement amount of million was returned to members in cash in September 2024. The remaining portion of the patronage capital allocation for fiscal year 2024 will be retained by CFC for years pursuant to the guidelines adopt ed by the CFC Board of Directors in June 2009.

 Long-term tax-exempt bonds of million as of both August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, consist of adjustable or variable-rate bonds that may be converted to a fixed rate as specified in the applicable indenture for each bond offering. We are unable to determine the maximum amount of interest that we may be required to pay related to the remaining adjustable and variable-rate bonds. Many of these bonds have a call provision that allows us to call the bond in the event of a default, which would limit our exposure to future interest payments on these bonds. Our maximum potential exposure generally is secured by mortgage liens on the members assets and future revenue. If a member s debt is accelerated because of a determination that the interest thereon is not tax-exempt, the member s obligation to reimburse us for any guarantee payments will be treated as a long-term loan. The maturities for long-term tax-exempt bonds and the related guarantees extend through calendar year 2037.

 operating segments, which were based on each of the legal entities included in our consolidated financial statements: CFC, NCSC and RTFC. We reported segment information for CFC separately; however, we aggregated segment information for NCSC and RTFC into reportable segment because neither entity met the quantitative materiality threshold for separate reporting under the accounting guidance governing segment reporting. On December 1, 2023, RTFC completed the sale of its business to NCSC. Following the RTFC sale transaction, our operating segments for Q1 FY2025 consist of CFC and NCSC, which are based on each of the legal entities included in our consolidated financial statements. As we aggregated segment information for NCSC and RTFC into reportable segment in Q1 FY2024 , the RTFC sale transaction did not cause a change in the composition of our reportable segments. We present the results of our business segments on the basis in which management internally evaluates operating performance to establish short- and long-term performance goals, develop budgets and forecasts, identify potential trends, allocate resources and make compensation decisions.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, see Part I Item 2. MD A Market Risk and Note 9 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, senior management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on this evaluation process, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. During the three months ended August 31, 2024, we implemented a new loan accounting system and as part of the implementation made certain changes to our internal controls over accounting and financial reporting for our loans. There have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended August 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 From time to time, CFC is subject to certain legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including litigation with borrowers related to enforcement or collection actions. Management presently believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, liquidity or results of operations. CFC establishes reserves for specific legal matters when it determines that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the loss is reasonably estimable. Accordingly, no reserve has been recorded with respect to any legal proceedings at this time. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 Our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity are subject to various risks and uncertainties, some of which are inherent in the financial services industry and others of which are more specific to our own business. We identify and discuss the most significant risk factors of which we are currently aware that could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity in the section Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2024 Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on August 1, 2024. We are not aware of any material changes in the risk factors identified in our 2024 Form 10-K. However, other risks and uncertainties, including those not currently known to us, could also negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Therefore, the risk factors identified and discussed in our 2024 Form 10-K should not be considered a complete discussion of all the risks and uncertainties we may face. For information on how we manage our key risks, see Item 7. MD A Enterprise Risk Management in our 2024 Form 10-K.
