 million and total assets of approximately billion Turkish lira (or approximately million). The monetary assets and liabilities denominated in the Turkish lira were approximately billion Turkish lira (or approximately million) and approximately billion Turkish lira (or approximately million), respectively, as of September 30, 2024. The monetary assets and liabilities were remeasured into United States dollar based on exchange rates as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Company has a wholly-owned subsidiary in Argentina that assembles and distributes agricultural equipment and replacement parts. In recent years, the Argentine government has substantially limited the ability of companies to transfer funds out of Argentina. As a consequence of these limitations, the spread between the official government exchange rate and the exchange rates resulting from certain capital market operations, usually effected to obtain United States dollars, has broadened significantly. Argentina's economy was determined to be highly inflationary during 2018. In December 2023, the central bank of Argentina adjusted the official foreign currency exchange rate for the Argentine peso, significantly devaluing the currency relative to the United States dollar. For the nine months ended and as of September 30, 2024, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary in Argentina had net sales of approximately million and total assets of approximately billion pesos (or approximately million). The monetary assets of the Company's operations in Argentina denominated in pesos at the official government rate were approximately billion pesos (or approximately million), inclusive of approximately billion pesos (or approximately million) in cash and cash equivalents, as of September 30, 2024. The monetary liabilities of the Company's operations in Argentina denominated in pesos at the official government rate were approximately billion pesos (or approximately million) as of September 30, 2024. The monetary assets and liabilities were remeasured into United States dollar based on exchange rates as of September 30, 2024. The Company's finance joint venture in Argentina, AGCO Capital Argentina S.A. ("AGCO Capital"), had net monetary assets denominated in pesos at the official government rate of approximately billion pesos (or approximately million) as of September 30, 2024. All gains and losses resulting from AGCO Capital's remeasurement of its monetary assets and liabilities are reported as part of AGCO Capital's net income, our share of which is included in Equity in net earnings of affiliates within our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 million of cash, (ii) the contribution by AGCO to the Joint Venture of its interest in JCA Industries, LLC d/b/a JCA Technologies and million of cash, and (iii) the purchase by AGCO from Trimble of membership interests in the Joint Venture in exchange for the payment by AGCO to Trimble of million in cash, subject to customary working capital and other adjustments. Immediately following the closing and as a result of the transaction, AGCO directly and indirectly owns an interest in the Joint Venture and Trimble owns a interest in the Joint Venture. The purchase price was funded using net proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes due 2027 and 2034, a term loan facility and the remainder through other borrowings and cash on hand. Refer to Note 9 for further information. AGCO began consolidating PTx Trimble within its consolidated financial statements on April 1, 2024. 
 
 The Company is accounting for the Joint Venture transaction as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recorded at their acquisition date fair value. The Company preliminarily allocated the purchase price of the acquisition to identified assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the aggregate fair values was recorded as goodwill. The Company calculated the fair value of the assets acquired using the income, market or cost approach (or a combination thereof). Fair values of certain assets were determined based on Level 3 inputs, including estimated future cash flows, discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates and sales projections, all of which require significant management judgment and are susceptible to change. The purchase price allocation was based upon preliminary information and is subject to change if additional information about the facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date becomes available. Measurement period adjustments to the previously disclosed preliminary fair values of developed technologies, tradename, favorable contracts, customer relationships and redeemable noncontrolling interests as a result of updated valuations were recorded resulting in a decrease of intangible assets of million, redeemable noncontrolling interests of million and goodwill of million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The adjustment to intangible assets resulted in a reduction of amortization expense of approximately million being recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Company continues to evaluate the valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to the acquisition, including inventories, developed technologies, tradename, favorable contracts, customer relationships, deferred taxes and redeemable noncontrolling interests. The final fair value of the net assets acquired may result in adjustments to these assets and liabilities, including goodwill. Any subsequent measurement period adjustments are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations. The goodwill consists of expected future economic benefits that will arise from expected future product sales, operating efficiencies and sales channel synergies that may result from the Joint Venture. The Company expects that the portion of the goodwill balance allocated to the US business will be deductible for tax purposes, and the goodwill allocated to the Joint Venture s investments in foreign subsidiaries, primarily in Germany and France, will not be deductible for tax purposes. At this time, the assignment of goodwill to reporting units has not yet been completed.

 The transfer of the interest in AGCO's JCA business is accounted for as an equity transaction. The adjustment to additional paid-in-capital represents the excess of the fair value of the JCA business transferred over its historical carrying amount. The fair value of the JCA business was determined using a discounted cash flow model.

 Trimble has a put option to sell its noncontrolling interests to the Company, and the Company has a call option to redeem Trimble's noncontrolling interests. The first exercisable date of both the put and call options is April 1, 2027. The put and call options prices are based on multiples of EBITDA, subject to the terms of the Agreement. We estimated the preliminary fair value of the put and call options using a Monte Carlo simulation along with a Black Scholes model assuming an exercise date of from the close of the transaction, the first allowable exercise date.

The Company recognizes assets and liabilities held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs to sell. The fair market value less costs to sell of the disposal group is evaluated at each reporting period to determine if it has changed, and any subsequent changes are recognized as a gain or loss with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the disposal group. The loss on business held for sale will be finalized in the fourth quarter upon the closing of the transaction based on the carrying value of the disposal group at the date of

million and million, respectively. Under these arrangements, the Company is required to continue to service the sold receivables at market rates. The Company does not maintain any direct retained interest in the receivables. The Company reviewed its accounting for the accounts receivable sales agreements and determined that receivables sold under these agreements should be accounted for as off-balance sheet transactions. 
 
 Losses on sales of receivables associated with the accounts receivable sales agreements discussed above, reflected within Other expense, net in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, were approximately million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Losses on sales of receivables associated with the accounts receivable sales agreements discussed above, reflected within Other expense, net in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, were approximately and million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 The Company s finance joint ventures in Europe, Brazil and Australia also provide wholesale financing directly to the Company s dealers. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, these finance joint ventures had approximately million and million, respectively, of outstanding accounts receivable associated with these arrangements. 
 
 In certain foreign countries, the Company invoices its finance joint ventures directly and the finance joint ventures retain a form of title to the goods delivered to dealers until the dealer makes payment so that the finance joint ventures can recover the goods in the event of dealer or end customer default on payment. This occurs as the laws of some foreign countries do not provide for a seller s retention of a security interest in goods in the same manner as established in the United States Uniform Commercial Code. The only right the finance joint ventures retain with respect to the title are those enabling recovery of the goods in the event of customer default on payment. The dealer or distributor may not return equipment or replacement parts to the Company while its contract with the finance joint venture is in force, and can only return the equipment to the retail finance joint venture with penalties that would generally not make it economically beneficial to do so.

Such guarantees generally obligate the Company to repay outstanding finance obligations owed to AGCO Capital if end users default on such loans to the extent that, due to non-credit risk, the end users are not able, or not required, to pay their loans, or are required to pay in a different currency than the one agreed in their loan. The Company also has obligations to guarantee indebtedness owed to certain of its finance joint ventures if dealers or end users default on loans. Losses under such guarantees historically have been insignificant, and the guarantees are not material. The Company believes the credit risk associated with these guarantees is not material. 
 
 In addition, at September 30, 2024, the Company had accrued approximately million of outstanding guarantees of residual values that may be owed to its finance joint ventures in the United States and Canada due upon expiration of certain eligible operating leases between the finance joint ventures and end users. The maximum potential amount of future payments under these guarantees is approximately million. 
 
 Other 
 
 The Company sells a majority of its wholesale receivables in North America, Europe and Brazil to its U.S., Canadian, European and Brazilian finance joint ventures. The Company also sells certain accounts receivable under factoring arrangements to financial institutions around the world. The Company accounts for the sale of such receivables as off-balance sheet transactions. Refer to Note 4 for discussion of the Company s accounts receivable sales agreements.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

GENERAL 
 
 Our operations are subject to the cyclical and seasonal nature of the agricultural industry. Sales of our equipment are affected by, among other things, changes in farm income, farm land values and debt levels, financing costs, acreage planted, crop yields, weather conditions, the demand for agricultural commodities, commodity and protein prices, agricultural product demand and general economic conditions and government policies and subsidies. We sell our equipment, precision agriculture technology and replacement parts to our independent dealers, distributors and other customers. A large majority of our sales are to independent dealers and distributors that sell our products to end users. To the extent practicable, we attempt to sell products to our dealers and distributors on a level basis throughout the year to reduce the effect of seasonal demands on our manufacturing operations and to minimize our investment in inventories. However, retail sales by dealers to farmers are highly seasonal and are a function of the timing of the planting and harvesting seasons. In certain markets, particularly in North America, there is often a time lag, which varies based on the timing and level of retail demand, between our sale of the equipment to the dealer and the dealer s sale to a retail customer. 
 
 On April 1, 2024, pursuant to the terms of an Amended and Restated Sale and Contribution Agreement among AGCO, Trimble and PTx Trimble (the Joint Venture ), AGCO and Trimble completed (i) the contribution by Trimble to the Joint Venture of Trimble s OneAg business, which is Trimble s agricultural business, excluding certain Global Navigation Satellite System and guidance technologies, and 8.1 million of cash, (ii) the contribution by AGCO to the Joint Venture of its interest in JCA Industries, LLC d/b/a JCA Technologies and 46.0 million of cash, and (iii) the purchase by AGCO from Trimble of membership interests in the Joint Venture in exchange for the payment by AGCO to Trimble of 1.954 billion in cash, subject to customary working capital and other adjustments. Immediately following the closing and as a result of the transaction, AGCO directly and indirectly owns an 85 interest in the Joint Venture and Trimble owns a 15 interest in the Joint Venture. AGCO began consolidating PTx Trimble within its consolidated financial statements on April 1, 2024. We believe PTx Trimble creates a global-leading mixed-fleet precision agriculture platform. We are the exclusive provider of Trimble s comprehensive technology offering, supporting the future development and distribution of next-generation agriculture technologies, allowing us to offer a wide variety of user-friendly technologies compatible across brands, equipment models and farm types. The acquired hardware, software and cloud-based applications span all aspects of the crop cycle, from land preparation to planting and seeding to harvest. Refer to Note 2 of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
 
 On July 25, 2024, the Company entered into a Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement to sell the majority of its Grain Protein G P business, which includes the GSI , Automated Production (AP), Cumberland , Cimbria and Tecno brands for a purchase price of 700.0 million, subject to customary working capital and other adjustments. The divestiture of the G P business aligns with AGCO's strategic transformation and allows for AGCO to better streamline and focus on its portfolio of agricultural machinery and precision ag technology products. As of June 30, 2024, the business met the criteria to be classified as held for sale. The Company recognizes assets and liabilities held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs to sell. The fair market value less costs to sell of the disposal group is evaluated at each reporting period to determine if it has changed, and any subsequent changes are recognized as a gain or loss with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the disposal group. The loss on business held for sale will be finalized in the fourth quarter upon the closing of the transaction based on the carrying value of the disposal group at the date of sale. The Company determined the intended sale of the G P business does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the consolidated results of operations, and therefore results of this business were not classified as discontinued operations. On November 1, 2024, the Company completed the previously announced sale of the Company s G P business to A-AG Holdco Limited, an affiliate of American Industrial Partners. Refer to Note 3 of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

 Net income attributable to AGCO Corporation and subsidiaries for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 30.0 million, or 0.40 per diluted share, compared to 280.6 million or 3.74 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net income (loss) attributable to AGCO Corporation and subsidiaries for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was (169.1) million, or (2.27) per diluted share, compared to 832.4 million or 11.10 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Net sales during the three months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 2,599.3 million, or 24.8 lower than the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower sales volumes resulting from softer industry sales reflecting lower end market demand and unfavorable currency impacts. Income from operations was 114.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 423.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in income from operations during 2024 was primarily the result of lower sales and production volumes reflecting weak industry conditions. 
 
 Net sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 8,774.6 million, or 17.3 lower than the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower sales volumes resulting from softer industry sales reflecting lower end market demand and unfavorable currency impacts. Income from operations was 146.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,307.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in income from operations during 2024 was primarily the result of lower sales and production volumes, the recognition of the estimated loss on the G P business held for sale as well as restructuring and business optimization expenses and higher selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG A expenses"), primarily related to transaction costs related to the close of the PTx Trimble joint venture transaction and the G P divestiture transaction and higher compensation costs.

 We estimate that worldwide average price increases (decreases) were approximately (1.2) and 9.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and (0.8) and 11.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Consolidated net sales of tractors and combines, which comprised approximately 57.6 and 61.2 of our net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased approximately 31.5 and 19.6 compared to the same periods in 2023. Unit sales of tractors and combines decreased approximately 29.4 and 23.5 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. The primary driver of the decrease in unit sales was lower sales of compact and mid-range tractors and combines. The difference between the unit sales change and the change in net sales was primarily the result of sales mix changes and foreign currency translation. 
 
 Overall, global production hours decreased approximately 34.8 and 24.4 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, reflecting our response to lower end market demand. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 
 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to lower production volumes and unfavorable net pricing impacts. 
 
 SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales were higher during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. The absolute level of SG A expenses were largely consistent during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The absolute level of SG A expenses increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to PTx Trimble joint venture transaction-related costs and transaction costs related to the divestiture of the Company's G P business. These increases were partially offset by decreases in stock compensation expense. We recorded 5.0 million and 20.4 million of stock compensation expense within SG A expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 9.8 million and 36.1 million during the same periods in 2023. 
 
 Engineering expenses as a percentage of net sales were higher during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily driven by increased engineering expenses related to the PTx Trimble joint venture. 
 
 We recorded impairment charges of 0.2 million and 5.3 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, related to the impairment of certain amortizing intangible assets and an investment in affiliate. There were no impairment charges recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 We recorded restructuring and business optimization expenses of 10.5 million and 41.7 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 0.8 million and 8.3 million, respectively, during the same periods in 2023. On June 24, 2024, the Company announced a restructuring program (the Program in response to increased weakening demand in the agriculture industry. The initial phase of the Program is focused on further reducing structural costs, streamlining the Company s workforce and enhancing global efficiencies related to changing the Company s operating model for certain corporate and back-office functions and better leveraging technology and global centers of excellence. The Company estimates that it will incur charges for one-time termination benefits of approximately 150.0 million to 200.0 million in connection with this phase of the Program, primarily consisting of cash charges related to severance payments, employees benefits and related costs. The Company expects the majority of these cash charges will be incurred in 2024 and the first half of 2025. Once fully implemented, the Company expects this phase of the Program to yield annual run-rate benefits and cost savings of approximately 100.0 million to 125.0 million. The restructuring expenses recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily related to severance, business optimization and other related costs associated with the Company's Program and rationalization of certain manufacturing facilities and administrative offices. Refer to Note 10 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
 
 We recorded a loss on business held for sale of 3.2 million and 497.8 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. There was no loss recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. On July 25, 2024, the Company announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell its G P business, and as of June 30, 2024, the Company determined that the G P business met the criteria to be classified as held for sale. As of September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a loss on business held for sale of 497.8 million, which represents the estimated loss on the business held for sale. Refer to Note 3 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
 
 Interest expense, net was 33.9 million and 65.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 5.5 million and 11.8 million for the comparable periods in 2023. The increase related primarily to

 an increase in interest expense resulting from the amortization of bridge facility commitment fees and increased debt levels related to financing the PTx Trimble joint venture transaction partially offset by higher interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for further information on our available funding. 
 
 Other expense, net was 52.3 million and 168.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 84.2 million and 212.6 million for the comparable periods in 2023. The decreases were primarily driven by decreases in foreign currency exchanges losses which were approximately 24.7 million and 74.3 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 43.8 million and 104.1 million, respectively, for the comparable periods in 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded the final insurance recovery of 5.0 million related to the 2022 cyber incident. Losses on sales of receivables, primarily related to our accounts receivable sales agreements with our finance joint ventures in North America, Europe and Brazil and included in Other expense, net, were approximately 28.4 million and 92.2 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 40.5 million and 99.3 million, respectively, for the comparable periods in 2023. 
 
 We recorded an income tax provision of 11.9 million and 122.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 75.3 million and 306.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective tax rate varies from period to period due to the mix of taxable income and losses in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate. Based on a favorable tax ruling in Brazil regarding the taxability of certain state value added tax incentive benefits, the Company recorded a 31.7 million reduction in the provision for income taxes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded approximately 26.4 million associated with our enrollment in a Brazilian tax amnesty program that is more fully described in Note 14 of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Equity in net earnings of affiliates, which is primarily comprised of income from our AGCO Finance joint ventures, was 12.2 million and 38.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 21.9 million and 55.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The Company recorded a net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of 1.1 million and 2.9 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The net loss primarily relates to the noncontrolling interests of the PTx Trimble joint venture held by Trimble, which owns a 15 interest in the joint venture. The Company recorded a net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of 0.1 million and 0.1 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

Results of Operations - Segment Information

 Net sales in EME decreased in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to sales volume declines, most significantly in mid-range tractors, high-horsepower tractors and hay tools, partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation and a favorable impact from the PTx Trimble joint venture transaction. Income from operations decreased by 116.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of lower sales and production volumes, increased discounting and higher warranty costs. 
 
 Net sales in EME decreased in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to sales volume declines, most significantly in mid-range tractors and hay tools, and lower sales of grain and protein products, partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation. Income from operations decreased by 79.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of lower sales and production volumes.

 Net sales in North America decreased in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to sales volume declines, most significantly in mid-range and high-horsepower tractors and hay tools. Income from operations decreased by 207.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of lower sales and production volumes and higher warranty costs. These decreases were partially offset by margin improvements related to grain and protein products.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Our financing requirements generally are subject to variations due to seasonal changes in inventory and receivable levels. Internally generated funds are supplemented when necessary from external sources, primarily our credit facilities and accounts receivable sales agreement facilities, subject to the discussion below with respect to the financing of the PTx Trimble joint venture transaction. Additional information regarding our indebtedness is contained in Note 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that the following borrowings and facilities listed below, together with available cash and internally generated funds, and assuming customary renewals and replacements, will be sufficient to support our working capital, capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future (in millions): September 30, 2024 (1) 
 Credit facility, expires 2027 790.0 Term Loan Facility borrowings 500.0 5.450 Senior notes due 2027

 Company. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 400.0 million and 700.0 million outstanding under the 2027 Notes and 2034 Notes, respectively. 
 
 In December 2023 and March 2024, the Company amended the Credit Facility to allow for incremental borrowings in the form of the Term Loan Facility in an aggregate principal amount of 500.0 million. The Company drew down the Term Loan Facility on March 28, 2024. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at the same rate and margin as the Credit Facility. The Term Loan Facility matures on December 19, 2027. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 500.0 million outstanding under the Term Loan Facility. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, on November 1, 2024, the Company repaid the 500.0 million outstanding under the Term Loan Facility utilizing proceeds from the sale of the Company s G P business discussed further below. 
 
 On September 28, 2023, the Company entered into a bridge facility commitment letter with Morgan Stanley pursuant to which Morgan Stanley committed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, a 2.0 billion senior unsecured 364-day bridge facility. The amount available under the Bridge Facility was reduced to zero by certain permanent financing transactions including the net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes, the Company's entry into the Term Loan Facility and by amounts based on the Company's cash flow. The Company terminated the Bridge Facility on March 25, 2024. 
 
 The PTx Trimble joint venture transaction closed on April 1, 2024. The Company financed the joint venture transaction through a combination of the Senior Notes due 2027 and 2034, the Term Loan Facility and the remainder through other borrowings and cash on hand. The Company had redeemable noncontrolling interests of 337.5 million as of September 30, 2024 resulting from the PTx Trimble joint venture transaction, which may require the use of cash in certain instances, beginning in 2027. Refer to Note 2 of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
 
 On November 1, 2024, the Company completed the previously announced sale of the Company s G P business to A-AG Holdco Limited, an affiliate of American Industrial Partners. The Company received proceeds of approximately 700.0 million from the sale, subject to customary working capital and other adjustments. The Company repaid the 500.0 million outstanding under the Term Loan Facility and 150.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facility utilizing proceeds from the sale. 
 
 The Company is in compliance with the financial covenants contained in these facilities and expects to continue to maintain such compliance. Should we ever encounter difficulties, our historical relationship with our lenders has been strong, and we anticipate their continued long-term support of our business. Refer to Note 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our current facilities, including the financial covenants contained in each debt instrument. 
 
 Our debt to capitalization ratio, which is total indebtedness divided by the sum of total indebtedness, excluding short-term borrowings due within one year, and stockholders equity, was 48.8 and 23.0 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase largely reflects the indebtedness incurred to pay the purchase price attendant to the PTx Trimble joint venture transaction.

 Our accounts receivable sales agreements in North America, Europe and Brazil permit the sale, on an ongoing basis, of a majority of our receivables to our U.S., Canadian, European and Brazilian finance joint ventures. The sales of all receivables are without recourse to us. We do not service the receivables after the sales occur, and we do not maintain any direct retained interest in the receivables. These agreements are accounted for as off-balance sheet transactions. The cash received from receivables sold under the U.S., Canadian, European and Brazilian accounts receivable sales agreements that remain outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was approximately 2.2 billion and 2.5 billion, respectively. 
 
 In addition, we sell certain trade receivables under factoring arrangements to other financial institutions around the world. The cash received from trade receivables sold under factoring arrangements that remain outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was approximately 205.4 million and 254.1 million, respectively. 
 
 Our finance joint ventures in Europe, Brazil and Australia also provide wholesale financing directly to our dealers. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, these finance joint ventures had approximately 203.2 million and 211.3 million, respectively, of outstanding accounts receivable associated with these arrangements. The total finance portfolio in our finance joint ventures was approximately 14.6 billion and 14.1 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The total finance portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 included approximately 11.8 billion and 10.8 billion, respectively, of retail receivables and 2.8 billion and 3.3 billion, respectively, of wholesale receivables from AGCO dealers. 
 
 In order to efficiently manage our liquidity, we generally pay vendors in accordance with negotiated terms. To enable vendors to obtain payment in advance of our payment due dates to them, we have established programs in certain markets with financial institutions under which the vendors have the option to be paid by the financial institutions earlier than the payment due dates. Should we not be able to negotiate extended payment terms with our vendors, or should financial institutions no longer be willing to participate in early payment programs with us, we would expect to have sufficient liquidity to timely pay our vendors without any material impact on us or our financial position. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amount outstanding that remains unpaid to the banks or other intermediaries associated with these programs totaled 77.7 million and 82.7 million, respectively. Refer to Note 8 of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 Cash flows used in operating activities were approximately 108.0 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to cash provided by operating activities of approximately 202.7 million for the same period in 2023. The increase of cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by a decrease in net income in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 Our working capital requirements are seasonal, with investments in working capital typically building in the first half of the year and then reducing in the second half of the year. We had approximately 2,258.8 million in working capital at September 30, 2024 as compared to 1,997.2 million at December 31, 2023. Inventories as of September 30, 2024 were approximately 3,443.2 million as compared to 3,440.7 million at December 31, 2023. Accounts and notes receivable, net, as of September 30, 2024 were approximately 156.9 million lower than at December 31, 2023 primarily due to timing of sales of accounts receivable under our factoring arrangements. Accounts payable and Accrued expenses as of September 30, 2024 were approximately 246.2 million and 395.0 million lower than at December 31, 2023, respectively.

 Capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2024 were approximately 279.3 million compared to 357.7 million for the same period in 2023. 
 
 Share Repurchase and Dividends 
 
 In November 2023, the Company entered into an ASR agreement with a financial institution to repurchase 53.0 million of shares of its common stock. We received approximately 371,669 shares associated with this transaction as of December 31, 2023. In January 2024, the Company received an additional 82,883 shares upon final settlement of our November 2023 ASR agreement. All shares received under the ASR agreement were retired upon receipt, and the excess of the purchase price over par value per share was recorded to a combination of Additional paid-in capital and Retained earnings within the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We did not purchase any shares directly or enter into any accelerated share repurchase agreements during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining amount authorized to be repurchased under board-approved share repurchase authorizations was approximately 57.0 million, which has no expiration date. On April 25, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors declared a special variable dividend of 2.50 per common share that was paid during the second quarter of 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company declared and paid cash dividends of 0.29 and 0.29 per common share, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company declared and paid cash dividends of 3.37 and 5.81 per common share, respectively. On October 24, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 0.29 per common share to be paid on December 16, 2024, to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 15, 2024. 

COMMITMENTS, OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
 
 We are party to a number of commitments and other financial arrangements, which may include off-balance sheet arrangements. At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding guarantees issued to our Argentine finance joint venture, AGCO Capital, of approximately 60.5 million. In addition, we had accrued approximately 13.0 million of outstanding guarantees of residual values that may be owed to our finance joint ventures in the United States and Canada due upon expiration of certain eligible operating leases between the finance joint ventures and end users. The maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantee is approximately 193.1 million. We also sell a majority of our wholesale receivables in North America, Europe and Brazil to our U.S., Canadian, European and Brazilian finance joint ventures. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources as well as to Notes 4 and 17 of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these matters. 
 
 Contingencies 
 
 During 2017, the Company purchased Precision Planting, which provides precision agricultural technology solutions. In 2018, Deere Company Deere filed separate complaints in the U.S. District Court of Delaware against the Company and Precision Planting alleging that certain products of those entities infringed certain patents of Deere. The two complaints subsequently were consolidated into a single case, Case No. 1:18-cv-00827-CFC. In July 2022, the case was tried before a jury, which determined that the Company and Precision Planting had not infringed the Deere patents. Following customary post-trial procedures, the Court entered a judgment in the Company s favor, and Deere appealed the judgment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The appeal is fully briefed and is awaiting oral arguments before the court. The Company has an indemnity right under the purchase agreement related to the acquisition of Precision Planting from its previous owner. Pursuant to that right, the previous owner of Precision Planting currently is responsible for the litigation costs associated with the complaint and is obligated to reimburse AGCO for some or all of the damages in the event of an adverse outcome in the litigation. 
 
 We are party to various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business. We closely monitor these claims and lawsuits and frequently consult with our legal counsel to determine whether they may, when resolved, have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations and accrue and/or disclose loss contingencies as appropriate. See Note 17 of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

 OUTLOOK 
 
 On April 1, 2024, AGCO acquired an 85 stake in PTx Trimble, and Trimble holds a 15 stake. AGCO began consolidating the PTx Trimble joint venture into its consolidated financial statements on April 1, 2024. On November 1, 2024, AGCO closed the previously announced divestiture of the Grain Protein business. 
 
 Global industry demand for farm equipment, driven by farm income, has declined during 2024 in most major markets compared to 2023. AGCO's net sales are expected to decrease in 2024 compared to 2023, resulting from lower sales volumes. Operating margins are expected to decrease from 2023 levels, reflecting the impact of lower net sales, lower production volumes, partially offset by increased cost controls and modestly lower investments in engineering. 
 
 Our outlook is based on current assumptions regarding a number of factors including demand, currency stability, pricing and market share gains. If our assumptions are incorrect, or other issues arise or return, such as a worsening of our supply chain, our results of operations will be adversely impacted. Refer to Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for further discussion. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 
 The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including those related to discount and sales incentive allowances, deferred income taxes and uncertain income tax positions, pensions, goodwill, other intangible and long-lived assets, and recoverable indirect taxes. Management bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A description of critical accounting policies and related judgments and estimates that affect the preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements is set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 Certain statements in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking, including certain statements set forth under the headings Liquidity and Capital Resources and Outlook. Forward-looking statements reflect assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future events. These statements, which may relate to such matters as earnings, net sales, margins, industry conditions, market demand, commodity prices, farm incomes, weather conditions, foreign currency translation impacts, general economic outlook, dividends, share repurchases, availability of financing, product development and enhancement, factory productivity, production and sales volumes, benefits from cost reduction initiatives, material costs, pricing impacts, tax rates, compliance with loan covenants, capital expenditures and working capital and debt service requirements are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts, and you can identify certain of these statements, but not necessarily all, by the use of the words anticipate, assumed, indicate, estimate, believe, predict, forecast, rely, expect, continue, grow and other words of similar meaning. Although we believe that the expectations and assumptions reflected in these statements are reasonable in view of the information currently available to us, there can be no assurance that these expectations will prove to be correct. 
 
 These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in or implied by the forward-looking statements. Adverse changes in any of the following factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements: 
 
 general economic and capital market conditions; 
 availability of credit to our retail customers; 
 the worldwide demand for agricultural products; 
 grain stock levels and the levels of new and used field inventories;

 production disruptions, including due to component and raw material availability; 
 production levels and capacity constraints at our facilities, including those resulting from plant expansions and systems upgrades; 
 integration of recent and future acquisitions, including the completed acquisition on April 1, 2024 of the Trimble ag assets and formation of the joint venture, PTx Trimble, and the ability to obtain the expected results; 
 our expansion plans in emerging markets; 
 supply constraints, including energy shortages; 
 our cost reduction and control initiatives;

 regulations affecting privacy and data protection; 
 technological difficulties; 
 the impact of the COVID-19, or other future pandemics, on product demand and production; 
 the occurrence of future cyberattacks, including ransomware attacks; and 
 the conflict in Ukraine. 
 
 We depend on suppliers for components, parts and raw materials for our products, and any failure by our suppliers to provide products as needed, or by us to promptly address supplier issues, will adversely impact our ability to timely and efficiently manufacture and sell products. In addition, the potential of future natural gas shortages in Europe, as well as predicted overall shortages in other energy sources, could also negatively impact our production and that of our supply chain in the future. There can be no assurance that there will not be future disruptions. 
 
 We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, and, as a result, we are subject to certain restrictive covenants and payment obligations that may adversely affect our ability to operate and expand our business.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Foreign Currency Risk Management 
 
 For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks in Item 7A of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of the third quarter of 2024, there has been no material change in our exposure to market risks. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of September 30, 2024, have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 The Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company s disclosure controls or the Company s internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. We will conduct periodic evaluations of our internal controls to enhance, where necessary, our procedures and controls. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 The Company closed the PTx Trimble joint venture transaction on April 1, 2024 and has included the operating results and assets and liabilities of the PTx Trimble joint venture in our condensed consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024. The scope of management s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures did not include the internal controls over financial reporting of the PTx Trimble joint venture. This exclusion is in accordance with the SEC Staff s general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from the scope of management s assessment for one year following the acquisition. 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation described above that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 We are a party to various other legal claims and actions incidental to our business. These items are more fully discussed in Note 17 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 The following information supplements our risks and uncertainties disclosed under "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of Part 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The risks and uncertainties described in our risk factors have the potential to materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. These risks are not exclusive and additional risks to which we are subject include the factors mentioned under Forward-Looking Statements and the risks described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 We are, and in the past have been, subject to the actions of activist stockholders, which could divert management s attention and negatively impact our business. 
 
 The Company values constructive input from investors and regularly engages in dialogue with its shareholders regarding strategy and performance. The Company s Board of Directors and management team are committed to acting in the best interests of all the Company s shareholders. Stockholders may, from time to time, engage in proxy solicitations or advance stockholder proposals, or otherwise attempt to effect changes and assert influence on our board of directors and management. Responding to some of these actions can be costly and time-consuming, may disrupt the Company s operations and divert the attention of the Board of Directors, management and the Company s employees. Such activities could interfere with the Company s ability to execute its strategic plan. Any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction and control, our ability to execute on our strategy, or changes to the composition of our board of directors or senior management team arising from a proxy contest could lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business or instability which may affect the market price and volatility of the Company s common stock, result in the loss of potential business opportunities, make it more difficult to pursue our strategic initiatives, or limit our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. We may choose to initiate, or may become subject to, litigation as a result of a proxy contest or matters arising from a proxy contest, which would serve as a further distraction to our board of directors and management and would require us to incur significant additional costs. In addition, actions such as those described above could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based upon temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 
 There were no purchases of our common stock made by or on behalf of us during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as such terms are defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Act of 1933).

 For Performance Share Awards intended to be performance-based compensation, the grant of the Awards and the establishment of the Performance Measures shall be made during the period required under Section 162(m) of the Code.

 (c) If the Exercise Price of any stock option granted under the Plan or any prior equity incentive plan of the Company is satisfied by tendering shares of Stock to the Company (by either actual delivery or by attestation), only the number of shares of Stock issued net of the shares of Stock tendered shall be deemed delivered for purposes of determining the maximum number of shares of Stock for delivery under the Plan. 
 
 (d) Subject to Article VII, in the event of a corporate transaction involving the Company (including, without limitation, any stock dividend, stock split, extraordinary cash dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination or exchange of shares), the Committee shall adjust Awards to preserve the benefits or potential benefits of the Awards. Action by the Committee may include (i) adjustment of the number and kind of shares which may be delivered under the Plan and the applicable limits under the Plan (ii) adjustment of the number and kind of shares subject to outstanding Awards (iii) adjustment of the Exercise Price of outstanding Options and SARs and (iv) any other adjustments that the Committee determines to be equitable provided, however that any adjustments to the number of shares subject to an Award and the Exercise Price to be paid therefor, shall be proportionately adjusted to reflect such transaction and only such transaction 
 9 

on a pro rata basis such that the aggregate Exercise Price of such Awards, if any, is not less than the aggregate Exercise Price before such transaction. The foregoing adjustment and the manner of application of the foregoing provisions shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion and to the extent not prohibited under Section 409A of the Code and the regulations thereunder. Any such adjustment may provide for the elimination of any fractional share which might otherwise become subject to an Award. 
 
 6.3. General Restrictions . Delivery of shares of Stock or other amounts under the Plan shall be subject to the following 
 
 (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, the Company shall have no liability to deliver any shares of Stock under the Plan or make any other distribution of benefits under the Plan unless such delivery or distribution would comply with all applicable laws (including, without limitation, the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933), and the applicable requirements of any securities exchange or similar entity. 
 
 (b) To the extent that the Plan provides for issuance of stock certificates to reflect the issuance of shares of Stock, the issuance may be effected on a non- certificated basis, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law or the applicable rules of any stock exchange. 
 
 (c) For Restricted Stock Awards granted to Eligible Individuals other than non-employee members of the Board, the time period for vesting, subject to Article VII and other provisions relating to the termination of employment, shall not be less than three years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, up to 250,000 of such Restricted Shares (less any shares referenced in the second sentence of Section 2.18) may vest in less than three years. 
 
 6.4. Tax Withholding . All Awards under the Plan are subject to withholding or payment of all applicable taxes, and the Committee may condition the delivery of any shares or other benefits under the Plan on satisfaction of the applicable withholding obligations. The Committee, in its discretion, and subject to such requirements as the Committee may impose prior to the occurrence of such withholding, may permit such withholding obligations to be satisfied through cash payment by the Participant or through the surrender of shares of Stock to which the Participant is otherwise entitled under the Plan. 
 
 6.5. Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Awards granted under this Plan are not intended to be treated as deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. Towards that end, the Plan will be administered and construed by the Committee in a manner to fulfill such intent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Company, its Subsidiaries or the Committee shall be liable to any Participant if any Award fails to be exempt from, or to be in compliance with, Section 409A of the Code. 
 
 6.6. Use of Shares . Subject to the overall limitation on the number of shares of Stock that may be delivered under the Plan, the Committee may use available shares of Stock as the form of payment for compensation, grants or rights earned or due under any other 
 10 

compensation plans or arrangements of the Company or a Subsidiary, including the plans and arrangements of the Company or a Subsidiary assumed in business combinations. 
 
 6.7. Dividends and Dividend Equivalents . An Award other than an Option or SAR Award may provide the Participant with the right to receive dividend payments or dividend equivalent payments with respect to Stock subject to the Award (both before and after the Stock subject to the Award is earned, vested, or acquired), which payments may be either made currently or credited to an account for the Participant, and may be settled in cash or Stock as determined by the Committee. Any such settlements, and any such crediting of dividends or dividend equivalents or reinvestment in shares of Stock, may be subject to such conditions, restrictions and contingencies as the Committee shall establish, including the reinvestment of such credited amounts in Stock equivalents. 
 
 6.8. Payments . Awards may be settled through cash payments, the delivery of shares of Stock, or combination thereof, as the Committee shall determine provided that, in the case of Restricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Units and Performance Share Awards, such Participant s taxable year during which the Award is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture or (ii) the last day of the Company s taxable year during which the Award is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. Any Award settlement, including payments thereof or delivery of Stock, may be subject to such conditions, restrictions and contingencies as the Committee shall determine. Each Subsidiary shall be liable for payment of cash due under the Plan with respect to any Participant to the extent that such benefits are attributable to the services rendered for that Subsidiary by the Participant. Any disputes relating to liability of a Subsidiary for cash payments shall be resolved by the Committee. 
 
 6.9. Transferability . Except as otherwise provided by the Committee, Awards under the Plan are not transferable except as designated by the Participant by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. 
 
 6.10. Form and Time of Elections . Unless otherwise specified herein, each election required or permitted to be made by any Participant or other person entitled to benefits under the Plan, and any permitted modification, or revocation thereof, shall be in writing filed with the Committee at such times, in such form, and subject to such restrictions and limitations, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, as the Committee shall require. 
 
 6.11. Action by Company or Subsidiary . Any action required or permitted to be taken by the Company or any Subsidiary shall be by resolution of its board, or by action of one or more members of the board (including a committee of the board) who are duly authorized to act for the board, or (except to the extent prohibited by applicable law or applicable rules of any stock exchange) by a duly authorized officer of such company. 
 
 6.12. Gender and Number . Where the context admits, words in any gender shall include any other gender, words in the singular shall include the plural and the plural shall include the singular. 
 
 6.13. Limitation of Implied Rights . 
 
 (a) Neither a Participant nor any other person shall, by reason of participation in the Plan, acquire any right in or title to any assets, funds or property of the Company or any Subsidiary whatsoever, including, without limitation, any specific funds, assets, or other property which the Company or any Subsidiary, in their sole 
 11 

discretion, may set aside in anticipation of a liability under the Plan. A Participant shall have only a contractual right to the Stock or amounts, if any, payable under the Plan, unsecured by any assets of the Company or any Subsidiary, and nothing contained in the Plan shall constitute a guarantee that the assets of the Company or any Subsidiary shall be sufficient to pay any benefits to any person. 
 
 (b) The Plan does not constitute a contract of employment or service, and selection as a Participant will not give any participating employee or service provider the right to be retained in the employ or service of the Company or any Subsidiary, nor any right to claim to any benefit under the Plan, unless such right or claim has specifically accrued under the terms of the Plan. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, no Award under the Plan shall confer upon the holder thereof any rights as a shareholder of the Company prior to the date on which the individual fulfills all conditions for receipt of such rights and issuance of Stock to such individual. 
 
 6.14. Evidence . Evidence required of anyone under the Plan may be by certificate, affidavit, document or other information which the person acting on it considers pertinent and reliable, and signed, made or presented by the proper party or parties. 
 
 6.15. Governing Law. This Plan and all Awards granted hereunder shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, except to the extent federal law applies. 
 
 ARTICLE VII 
 CHANGE IN CONTROL 
 
 Subject to the provisions of Section 6.2(d) (relating to the adjustment of shares), and except as otherwise provided in the Plan or the Award Agreement reflecting the applicable Award, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (a) all outstanding Options shall become fully exercisable (b) all outstanding SARs shall become fully exercisable and (c) all Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units and Performance Shares shall become fully vested. 
 
 Notwithstanding any provision of any Award Agreement, in the event of or in anticipation of a Change in Control, the Committee in its discretion may (a) declare that some or all outstanding Options and or SARs previously granted under the Plan, whether or not then exercisable or vested, shall terminate as of a date before or on the Change in Control without any payment to the holder thereof (other than repayment of the purchase price, if any, paid for such Awards), provided that the Committee gives prior written notice to the Participants of such termination and gives such Participants the right to exercise the outstanding Options or SARs for at least seven (7) days before such date to the extent then exercisable (or to the extent such Options or SARs would have been exercisable as of the Change in Control) (b) terminate before or on the Change in Control some or all outstanding Awards previously granted under the Plan, whether or not then exercisable, vested or earned and payable, in consideration of payment to the holder thereof, (i) with respect to each share of Stock for which the Option or SAR is then exercisable (or for which the Option or SAR would have been exercisable as of the Change in Control), of the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value on such date of the Stock subject to such portion of the Option or SAR over the exercise or base price (provided that outstanding Options or SARs that are not then exercisable and that would not become exercisable on the Change in Control, and Options or SARs with respect to which the Fair Market Value of the Stock subject to the Options or SARs does not exceed the exercise or base price, shall be cancelled without any payment therefor), (ii) with respect to 
 12 

Restricted Stock Awards that are not then nonforfeitable and transferable (but that would have become nonforfeitable and transferable as of the Change in Control) in exchange for the payment equal to the difference between the then Fair Market Value of the shares of Stock subject to the Restricted Stock Award less the unpaid purchase price, if any, for such shares or (iii) with respect to Restricted Stock Units or Performance Shares that are not then vested, earned and payable (but that would have become vested, earned and payable as of the Change in Control) in exchange for a payment equal to the amount which would have been payable under such Restricted Stock Units or Performance Share Awards (c) terminate before or on the Change in Control some or all outstanding Restricted Stock Units or Performance Share Awards previously granted under the Plan that are not then vested, earned and payable (and that would not have become vested, earned and payable as of the Change in Control) without any payment to the holder thereof or (d) take such other action as the Committee determines to be reasonable under the circumstances to permit the Participant to realize the value of the Award (which value for purposes of Awards that are not then exercisable, vested or payable and that would not become exercisable, vested or payable as of the Change in Control, and Options or SARs with respect to which the Fair Market Value of the Stock subject to the Options or SARs does not exceed the exercise or base price, shall be deemed to be zero). The payments described above may be made in any manner the Committee determines, including in cash, stock or other property (whether or not part of the consideration of the Change in Control). The Committee may take the actions described above with respect to Awards that are not then exercisable whether or not the Participant will receive any payment therefor. The Committee in its discretion may take any of the actions described in this Article VII contingent on consummation of the Change in Control and with respect to some or all outstanding Awards, whether or not then exercisable, vested or payable or on an Award-by-Award basis, which actions need not be uniform with respect to all outstanding Awards. However, the Awards shall not be terminated to the extent that written provision is made for their continuance, assumption or substitution by the Company or a successor employer or its parent or subsidiary in connection with the Change in Control. 
 
 ARTICLE VIII 
 COMMITTEE 
 
 8.1. Administration . The authority to control and manage the operation and administration of the Plan shall be vested in a committee (the Committee in accordance with this Article 8.

In the event that the Board does not have a Compensation Committee or the Board expressly determines that the Compensation Committee shall not be the Committee, the members of the Committee shall be selected by the Board and the Committee shall be comprised of two or more members of the Board who satisfy the independence requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code as well as any other applicable stock exchange or Exchange Act independence requirements. If the Committee does not exist, or for any other reason determined by the Board, the members of the Board deemed to meet such independence standards by the Board may take any action under the Plan that would otherwise be the responsibility of the Committee.

 (b) The Committee may, without amending the Plan, provide for different terms and conditions for the Awards granted to Participants who are foreign nationals or employed outside the United States in order to accommodate differences in laws, rules, regulations or customs of such foreign jurisdictions with respect to tax, securities, currency, employee benefit or other matters, and may make such awards pursuant to sub-plans and other appropriate means. 
 
 (c) The Committee will have the authority and discretion to interpret the Plan, to establish, amend, and rescind any rules and regulations relating to the Plan, to determine the terms and provisions of any Award Agreement made pursuant to the Plan,and to make all other determinations that may be necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan.

Any such allocation or delegation may be revoked by the Committee at any time. 
 
 8.4. Information to be Furnished to Committee .

The records of the Company and Subsidiaries as to an employee s or Participant s employment, service, termination of employment or service, leave of absence, reemployment and compensation shall be conclusive on all persons unless determined by the Committee to be incorrect. Participants and other persons entitled to benefits under the Plan must furnish the Committee such evidence, data or information as the Committee considers desirable to carry out the terms of the Plan. 

ARTICLE IX 
 AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION 
 
 The Board may, at any time, amend or terminate the Plan, provided that no amendment or termination may, in the absence of written consent to the change by the affected Participant (or, if the Participant is not then living, the affected beneficiary), materially adversely affect the rights of any Participant or beneficiary under any Award 
 14 

granted under the Plan prior to the date such amendment is adopted by the Board provided that adjustments pursuant to Section 6.2(d) and amendments to allow the Plan and the Awards issued thereunder to comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations and other applicable law thereunder or to be exempt from Section 409A of the Code shall not be subject to the foregoing limitations of this Article IX. 
 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment that (i) materially increases the benefits accruing to participants under the Plan, or (ii) materially expands the definition of Eligible Employee shall be effective until such amendment has been approved by stockholders of the Company.
