 In September 2023, Park-Ohio Industries, Inc. Park-Ohio amended its Seventh Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in the amount of million, including a million Canadian revolving subcommitment and a European revolving subcommitment in the amount of million. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, Park-Ohio has the option to increase the availability under the revolving credit facility by an aggregate incremental amount up to million. The Credit Agreement matures on January 14, 2027. As of September 30, 2024, we had borrowing availability of million under the Credit Agreement.

 In 2017, Park-Ohio completed the issuance, in a private placement, of million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2027 (the Notes ). The Notes are unsecured senior obligations of Park-Ohio and are guaranteed on an unsecured senior basis by the owned material domestic subsidiaries of Park-Ohio. 
 Fair value 
 
 The fair value of the revolving credit facility is equal to its carrying value as the Company has the ability to repay the outstanding principal at par value at any time. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.

Our subsidiaries are involved in a number of contractual and warranty-related disputes. We believe that appropriate liabilities for these contingencies have been recorded; however, actual results may differ materially from our estimates. 
 
 In addition to the routine lawsuits and asserted claims noted above, we are also a co-defendant in cases asserting claims on behalf of plaintiffs alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos. In every asbestos case in which we are named as a party, the complaints are filed against multiple named defendants. Historically, we have been dismissed from asbestos cases. We intend to vigorously defend these cases and believe we will continue to be successful in being dismissed from such cases. 
 
 While it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of asbestos-related lawsuits, claims and proceedings due to the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation, and although our results of operations and cash flows for a particular period could be adversely affected by asbestos-related lawsuits, claims and proceedings, management believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Park-Ohio Holdings Corp. and its subsidiaries (collectively, we, our, or the Company ). All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
 
 We are a diversified international company providing world-class customers with a supply chain management outsourcing service, capital equipment used on their production lines, and manufactured components used to assemble their products. We operate through three reportable segments: Supply Technologies, Assembly Components and Engineered Products. 
 
 Supply Technologies provides our customers with Total Supply Management , a proactive solutions approach that manages the efficiencies of every aspect of supplying production parts and materials to our customers manufacturing floor, from strategic planning to program implementation. Total Supply Management includes such services as engineering and design support, part usage and cost analysis, supplier selection, quality assurance, bar coding, product packaging and tracking, just-in-time and point-of-use delivery, electronic billing services and ongoing technical support. Our Supply Technologies business services customers in the following principal industries: heavy-duty truck; power sports and recreational equipment; aerospace and defense; semiconductor equipment; electrical distribution and controls; consumer electronics; bus and coaches; automotive; agricultural and industrial equipment; HVAC; lawn and garden; plumbing; and medical devices. 
 
 Assembly Components manufactures products oriented towards fuel efficiency and reduced emission standards. Assembly Components designs, develops and manufactures aluminum products and highly efficient, high pressure direct fuel injection fuel rails and pipes; fuel filler pipes that route fuel from the gas cap to the gas tank; flexible multi-layer plastic and rubber assemblies used to transport fuel from the vehicle's gas tank and then, at extreme high pressure, to the engine's fuel injector nozzles. Our product offerings include gasoline direct injection systems and fuel filler assemblies, and industrial hose and injected molded rubber and plastic components. Our products are primarily used in the following industries: including automotive and light-vehicle; agricultural equipment; construction equipment; heavy-duty truck; and bus. 
 
 Engineered Products operates a diverse group of niche manufacturing businesses that design and manufacture a broad range of highly-engineered products, including induction heating and melting systems, pipe threading systems and forged and machined products. Engineered Products also produces and provides services and spare parts for the equipment it manufactures. The principal customers of Engineered Products are OEMs, sub-assemblers and end users in the following industries: ferrous and non-ferrous metals; coatings; forging; foundry; heavy-duty truck; construction equipment; automotive; oil and gas; rail; aerospace and defense; and power generation. 
 
 Sales and operating income for these three segments are provided in Note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere herein. 
 
 During the fourth quarter of 2022, we determined that our Aluminum Products business met the held-for-sale and discontinued operations accounting criteria. Accordingly, the Company has reported the held-for-sale assets and liabilities, the operating results and the cash flows of Aluminum Products in discontinued operations for all periods presented throughout this Report on Form 10-Q. On December 29, 2023, the Company sold this business to Angstrom Automotive Group for approximately 50 million in cash and promissory notes, plus the assumption of approximately 3 million of financial lease obligations. The total purchase price consisted of a cash down payment of 20.0 million paid to the Company in December 2022; cash of 15.5 million paid to the Company at closing; and promissory notes totaling up to 15.0 million payable to the Company on approximately the one-year anniversary of the sale, of which up to 10.0 million is contingent on the Aluminum Products business attaining certain purchase commitments during 2024. See Note 5, Discontinued Operations, to the condensed consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere herein.

 Net Sales 
 
 Net sales decreased 0.3 to 417.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 418.8 million in the same period in 2023. We continued to see strong customer demand in our Supply Technologies segment and the capital equipment business in our Engineered Products segment, offset by lower product pricing in our Assembly Components segment. 
 
 The factors explaining the changes in segment net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding 2023 period are contained within the Segment Results section below. 
 
 Cost of Sales and Gross Margin 
 
 Cost of sales decreased to 345.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 348.8 million in the same period in 2023. The decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to the decrease in net sales for the 2024 period compared to the corresponding period in 2023, plus the impact of ongoing profit improvement initiatives. Gross margin improved 60 basis points to 17.3 in the 2024 period compared to 16.7 in the corresponding 2023 period, driven by improved profitability in our Supply Technologies segment; higher sales and improved margins in our capital equipment business; and ongoing profit improvement initiatives across the company. 
 
 SG A Expenses 
 
 SG A expenses were 47.8 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 43.0 million in the comparable period in 2023, an increase of 11.2 . As a percentage of net sales, SG A expenses were 11.4 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to

 Operating Activities 
 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated cash of 8.6 million compared to 24.3 million in the same period of 2023. Cash flow from operating activities was lower in 2024 due to higher working capital needs. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Capital expenditures were 22.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and were primarily to provide increased capacity for future growth in our Engineered Products and Assembly Components segments, to maintain existing operations and for information system implementation. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company paid 11.0 million, net of cash acquired for the EMA acquisition. 
 
 Capital expenditures were 20.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and were primarily to provide increased capacity for future growth in our Engineered Products and Assembly Components segments, for facility consolidation in our Engineered Products segment and to maintain existing operations. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net debt borrowings of 18.4 million to fund capital expenditures and the EMA acquisition. In addition, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company generated proceeds from common stock issuances totaling 24.7 million, made scheduled payments related to prior acquisitions totaling 2.2 million and made cash dividend payments totaling 5.4 million. See Note 15, Weighted-Average Number of Shares Used in Computing Earnings Per Share, to the condensed consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere herein, for further discussion about the common stock issuances. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had net debt borrowings of 5.4 million to fund a portion of our capital expenditures. In addition, the Company made scheduled payments related to prior acquisitions totaling 2.1 million and made cash dividend payments to shareholders totaling 4.9 million. 
 
 We do not have off-balance sheet arrangements, financing or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, other than the letters of credits disclosed in Note 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere herein. 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 Our liquidity needs are primarily for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and acquisitions. Our primary sources of liquidity have been funds provided by operations, funds available from existing bank credit arrangements and the sale of our debt securities. Our existing financial resources (working capital, available bank borrowing arrangements and our at the market program) and anticipated cash flow from operations are expected to be adequate to meet anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months and the foreseeable future thereafter, including but not limited to our ability to maintain current operations and fund capital expenditure requirements, service our debt, pursue acquisitions, pay dividends and

repurchase common shares. For more information about our at the market program and other sales of common stock, see Note 15, Weighted-Average Number of Shares Used in Computing Earnings Per Share, to the condensed consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere herein. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had total liquidity of 194.4 million, which included 59.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and 134.9 million of unused borrowing availability under our credit agreements, which includes 18.1 million of suppressed availability. 
 
 The Company had cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries of 48.6 million at September 30, 2024 and 44.6 million at December 31, 2023. We do not expect restrictions on repatriation of cash held outside the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations for the foreseeable future. 
 
 The Company has two components to its assertion regarding reinvestment of foreign earnings outside of the United States. First, for all foreign subsidiaries except RB W Corporation of Canada RB W ), all earnings are permanently reinvested outside of the United States. Second, for RB W, dividend distributions may be made, but only to the extent of current earnings in excess of cash required to fund its business operations; all accumulated earnings are permanently reinvested. 
 
 Senior Notes 
 
 In April 2017, Park-Ohio Industries, Inc. Park-Ohio ), the operating subsidiary of Park-Ohio Holdings Corp., completed the sale, in a private placement, of 350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.625 Senior Notes due 2027 (the Notes ). The net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes were used to repay in full our previously outstanding 8.125 Senior Notes due 2021 and our outstanding term loan, and to repay a portion of the borrowings then outstanding under our revolving credit facility. 
 
 Credit Agreement 
 
 In September 2023, Park-Ohio amended its Seventh Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in the amount of 405.0 million, including a 40.0 million Canadian revolving subcommitment and a European revolving subcommitment in the amount of 30.0 million. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, Park-Ohio has the option to increase the availability under the revolving credit facility by an aggregate incremental amount up to 70.0 million. The Credit Agreement matures on January 14, 2027. 
 
 Finance Leases 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had finance leases totaling 14.6 million. 
 
 Covenants 
 
 The future availability of bank borrowings under the revolving credit facility provided by the Credit Agreement is based on (1) our calculated availability under the Credit Agreement and (2) if such calculated availability decreases below 50.625 million, our ability to meet a debt service ratio covenant. If our calculated availability is less than 50.625 million, our debt service coverage ratio must be greater than 1.0. At September 30, 2024, our calculated availability under the Credit Agreement was 108.7 million; therefore, the debt service ratio covenant did not apply. 
 
 Failure to maintain calculated availability of at least 50.625 million and meet the debt service ratio covenant could materially impact the availability and interest rate of future borrowings. Our debt service coverage ratio could be materially impacted by negative economic trends. To make certain permitted payments as defined under the Credit Agreement, including but not limited to acquisitions and dividends, we must meet defined availability thresholds ranging from 37.5 million to 50.625 million, and a defined debt service coverage ratio of 1.15. 
 
 As our calculated availability under the Credit Agreement was above 50.625 million, we were also in compliance with the other covenants contained in the revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2024. While we expect to remain in 
 29 

Table of Contents 

compliance throughout 2024, declines in sales volumes in the future could adversely impact our ability to remain in compliance with certain of these financial covenants. Additionally, to the extent our customers are adversely affected by declines in the economy in general, they may be unable to pay their accounts payable to us on a timely basis or at all, which could make our accounts receivable ineligible for purposes of the revolving credit facility and could reduce our borrowing base and our ability to borrow under such facility. 
 
 Dividends 
 
 The Company declared and paid dividends to shareholders of 4.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. On November 1, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of 0.125 per common share. The dividend will be paid on November 29, 2024 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 15, 2024 and will result in a cash outlay of approximately 1.6 million. Although we currently intend to pay a quarterly dividend on an ongoing basis, all future dividend declarations will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and dependent upon then-existing conditions, including our operating results and financial condition, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, business prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. 
 
 Seasonality; Variability of Operating Results 
 
 The timing of orders placed by our customers has varied with, among other factors, orders for customers finished goods, customer production schedules, competitive conditions and general economic conditions. The variability of the level and timing of orders has, from time to time, resulted in significant periodic and quarterly fluctuations in the operations of our businesses. Such variability is particularly evident in our capital equipment business, included in the Engineered Products segment, which typically ships large systems at a relatively lower pace than our other businesses. 

Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 Our critical accounting policies are described in "Item. 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, both contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There were no new critical accounting policies or updates to existing critical accounting policies as a result of new accounting pronouncements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 The application of our critical accounting policies may require management to make judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Management uses historical experience and all available information to make these estimates and judgments, and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates. 

Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain statements that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. The words believes , anticipates , plans , expects , intends , estimates and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. 
 
 These forward-looking statements, including statements regarding future performance of the Company, that are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance and achievements, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations include, but are not limited to, the following: our ability to realize any contingent consideration from the sale of the Aluminum Products business; the impact supply chain and logistic issues have on our business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity; our substantial indebtedness; the uncertainty of the global economic environment; general business conditions and competitive factors, including pricing pressures and product innovation; demand for our products and services; the impact of labor disturbances affecting our customers; raw material availability and pricing; fluctuations in energy costs; component part availability and pricing; changes in our relationships with customers and suppliers; the financial condition of our customers,

including the impact of any bankruptcies; our ability to successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions into existing operations, including the EMA acquisition; the amounts and timing, if any, of purchases of our common stock; changes in general economic conditions such as inflation rates, interest rates, tax rates, unemployment rates, higher labor and healthcare costs, recessions and changing government policies, laws and regulations, including those related to the current global uncertainties and crises, such as tariffs and surcharges; adverse impacts to us, our suppliers and customers from acts of terrorism or hostilities, including the conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East, or political unrest, including the rising tension between China and the United States; public health issues, including the outbreak of infectious diseases and any impact on our facilities and operations and our customers and suppliers; our ability to meet various covenants, including financial covenants, contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness; disruptions, uncertainties or volatility in the credit markets that may limit our access to capital; potential disruption due to a partial or complete reconfiguration of the European Union; increasingly stringent domestic and foreign governmental regulations, including those affecting the environment or import and export controls and other trade barriers; inherent uncertainties involved in assessing our potential liability for environmental remediation-related activities; the outcome of pending and future litigation and other claims and disputes with customers; our dependence on the automotive and heavy-duty truck industries, which are highly cyclical; the dependence of the automotive industry on consumer spending; our ability to negotiate contracts with labor unions; our dependence on key management; our dependence on information systems; our ability to continue to pay cash dividends, and the timing and amount of any such dividends; and the other factors we describe under Item 1A. Risk Factors included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a forward-looking statement herein should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk 
 
 We are exposed to market risk, including changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, we are subject to interest rate risk on borrowings under the floating rate revolving credit facility provided by our Credit Agreement. A 100-basis-point increase in the interest rate would have resulted in an increase in interest expense on these borrowings of approximately 2.1 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Our foreign subsidiaries generally conduct business in local currencies. We face translation risks related to the changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated in U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Shareholders' Equity section of the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Sales and expenses at our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable monthly average exchange rates. Therefore, changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our net sales and expenses from foreign operations as expressed in U.S. dollars. 
 
 Our largest exposures to commodity prices relate to metal and rubber compounds, which have fluctuated widely in recent years. In 2024 and 2023, we entered into agreements to hedge foreign currency. These agreements did not have a material impact on the results of the Company. We have no other commodity swap agreements or forward purchase contracts. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. 
 
 Under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Part II. Other Information 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 We are involved in a variety of claims, suits, investigations and administrative proceedings with respect to commercial, premises liability, product liability, employment, personal injury and environmental matters arising from the ordinary course of business. While any such claims, suits, investigations and proceedings involve an element of uncertainty, in the opinion of management, liabilities, if any, arising from currently pending or threatened litigation are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. 
 
 In addition to the routine lawsuits and asserted claims noted above, we were a party to the lawsuits and legal proceedings described below as of September 30, 2024: 
 
 We were a co-defendant in 106 cases asserting claims on behalf of 151 plaintiffs alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos. These asbestos cases generally relate to production and sale of asbestos-containing products and allege various theories of liability, including negligence, gross negligence and strict liability, and seek compensatory and, in some cases, punitive damages. 
 
 In every asbestos case in which we are named as a party, the complaints are filed against multiple named defendants. In substantially all of the asbestos cases, the plaintiffs either claim damages in excess of a specified amount, typically a minimum amount sufficient to establish jurisdiction of the court in which the case was filed (jurisdictional minimums generally range from 25,000 to 75,000), or do not specify the monetary damages sought. To the extent that any specific amount of damages is sought, the amount applies to claims against all named defendants. 
 
 Historically, we have been dismissed from asbestos cases on the basis that the plaintiff incorrectly sued one of our subsidiaries or because the plaintiff failed to identify any asbestos-containing product manufactured or sold by us or our subsidiaries. We intend to vigorously defend these asbestos cases, and believe we will continue to be successful in being dismissed from such cases. However, it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of asbestos-related lawsuits, claims and proceedings due to the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation. Despite this uncertainty, and although our results of operations and cash flows for a particular period could be adversely affected by asbestos-related lawsuits, claims and proceedings, management believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Among the factors management considered in reaching this conclusion were: (a) our historical success in being dismissed from these types of lawsuits on the bases mentioned above; (b) many cases have been improperly filed against one of our subsidiaries; (c) in many cases the plaintiffs have been unable to establish any causal relationship to us or our products or premises; (d) in many cases, the plaintiffs have been unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any identifiable injury or compensable loss at all or that any injuries that they have incurred did in fact result from alleged exposure to asbestos; and (e) the complaints assert claims against multiple defendants and, in most cases, the damages alleged are not attributed to individual defendants. Additionally, we do not believe that the amounts claimed in any of the asbestos cases are meaningful indicators of our potential exposure because the amounts claimed typically bear no relation to the extent of the plaintiff's injury, if any. 
 Our cost of defending these lawsuits has not been material to date and, based upon available information, our management does not expect its future costs for asbestos-related lawsuits to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity or financial position. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 There have been no material changes in the risk factors previously disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Investors should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk has not already materialized.
