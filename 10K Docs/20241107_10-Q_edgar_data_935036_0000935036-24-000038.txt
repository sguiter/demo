 The Company s effective tax rate could fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to the occurrence of significant and unusual or infrequent items, such as vesting of stock-based compensation or foreign currency gains and losses. The Company s effective tax rate could also fluctuate due to changes in the valuation of its deferred tax assets or liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof. In addition, the Company is occasionally subject to examination of its income tax returns by tax authorities in the jurisdictions it operates. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes.

Global Economy and Inflation 
 Since 2022, the global economy has experienced high inflation, increased interest rates, and pressures on gross domestic product. While we believe our business is resilient and can generally weather unusually high levels of inflation, inflationary pressures have had some impact on our financial performance. Specifically, inflation impacted our interchange costs associated with the Biller segment. 
 
 Overview 
 ACI Worldwide powers digital payments for more than 6,000 organizations around the world. More than 1,000 of the largest banks and intermediaries, as well as thousands of global merchants, rely on ACI to execute 14 trillion each day in payments and securities. In addition, myriad organizations utilize our electronic bill presentment and payment services. Through our comprehensive suite of software solutions delivered on customers' premises, through the public cloud or through ACI's private cloud, we provide real-time, immediate payments capabilities and enable the industry's most complete omni-channel payments experience. 
 
 Our products are sold and supported directly and through distribution networks covering three geographic regions the Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa EMEA and Asia Pacific. Each region has its own globally coordinated sales force, supplemented with local independent reseller and/or distributor networks. Our products and solutions are marketed under the ACI Worldwide brand and used globally by banks and intermediaries, merchants, and billers, such as third-party electronic payment processors, payment associations, switch interchanges, and a wide range of transaction-generating endpoints, including ATMs, merchant point-of-sale POS terminals, bank branches, mobile phones, tablets, corporations, and internet commerce sites. 
 
 We derive a majority of our revenues from domestic operations and believe we have large opportunities for growth in international markets, as well as continued expansion domestically in the United States. We also continue to maintain centers of expertise in Timisoara, Romania, and Pune and Bangalore in India, as well as key operational centers such as in Cape Town, South Africa and in multiple locations in the United States.

Table of contents 

 Our business and operating results are influenced by trends such as information technology spending levels, the growth rate of digital payments, mandated regulatory changes, and changes in the number and type of customers in the financial services industry, as well as economic growth, and purchasing habits. 
 
 Key trends that currently impact our strategies and operations include: 
 Increasing digital payment transaction volumes. The adoption of digital payments continues to accelerate, propelled by the digitization of cash, financial inclusion efforts of countries throughout the world, the Internet of Things, rapid growth of eCommerce and the adoption of real-time payments. COVID-19 further accelerated this growth as more people, governments, and businesses embraced digital payments - a change that has continued. We leverage the growth in transaction volumes through the licensing of new systems to customers whose older systems cannot handle increased volume, through the sale of capacity upgrades to existing customers, and through the scalability of our platform-based solutions. 
 
 Adoption of real-time payments. Expectations from both consumers and businesses are continuing to drive the payments world to more real-time delivery. This is bolstered by the new data-rich ISO 20022 messaging format, which is delivering greater value to banks and their customers. We are seeing global players with existing schemes working to expand capacity in anticipation of volume growth and new payment types. Mature markets, including India, the United Kingdom, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and the Nordics, continue to accelerate innovation, especially in terms of overlay services and cross-border connectivity. The United States is driving real-time payments adoption through Zelle, TCH Real-Time Payments, and the FedNow service. We are seeing success with real-time payments in the Middle East as well, as they have started to renovate their payment systems from legacy payment types to the modern digital and real-time world. ACI's broad software portfolio, experience, and strategic partnerships with Mastercard, Microsoft, and Mindgate Solutions continue to position us as a leader in real-time payments, helping to drive seamless connectivity, increased security, and end-to-end modernization for organizations throughout the world. 
 
 Adoption of cloud technology. ACI has recognized the industry's technical inflection point in the transition from traditional on-premise infrastructure to the public cloud, and we are supporting our customers' cloud strategies. Public and private cloud technology innovations allow the financial services ecosystem to accelerate innovation and ensure scalability and resiliency while improving operating economics over time. As banks and intermediaries, merchants, and billers seek to transition their systems to make use of cloud technology, our investments and partnerships, as demonstrated by our product enablement and initial optimization onto Microsoft Azure, enable us to leverage those cloud technology benefits today and for the future while preserving ACI's fundamental base of performance, resiliency, and scalability. 
 
 Payments intelligence, fraud, and compliance. The accelerated adoption of real-time payments increases the urgency for industry-wide collaboration against fraud. As the threat of scams becomes a greater concern for remitting and receiving institutions, consumers are challenged with increased friction to prevent account take-over and criminals successfully persuading consumers to push transactions themselves, inadvertently, to mule accounts they have full control of, created with fake or synthetic identity, or simply "borrowed" with or without consent of the legit account holders. Regulators are beginning to litigate between consumers and financial institutions on the losses, and between emitting and receiving banks on the accountability for reimbursement. Banks and intermediaries, merchants, and billers are pursuing solutions to mitigate their risks while improving their customer experience, protecting their margins, and securing their revenue streams, especially with their new products and offerings. We continue to see opportunity for our advanced machine learning and network intelligence capabilities to stop criminals and enable frictionless legitimate business. 
 
 Omni-commerce. Shoppers are increasingly browsing, buying, and returning items across channels, including in-store, online, and mobile. COVID-19 accelerated this trend, leading to an increase in contactless payments, click and collect, and curbside collection. Merchants from all industries, including grocers, fuel and convenience stores, are being tasked with delivering seamless experiences that include pay-in-aisle, kiosks, mobile app payments, QR code payments, eCommerce, traditional and mobile POS, buy online pickup in-store (BOPIS), and buy online return in-store (BORIS). We believe there is significant opportunity to provide merchants with the tools to deliver a seamless, secure, personalized experience that creates loyalty and satisfaction, and drives conversion rates while protecting consumer data and preventing fraud. 
 
 Request for Payment (RfP). Markets across the world are introducing an innovative payments service called Request for Payment (RfP). This technology is known by different names in different markets: Collect payments in India, Request 2 Pay in Europe, Request To Pay (RTP) in the United Kingdom, or Request for Payment (RfP) in the United States. RfP offers secure messaging between consumers and billers or merchants, wherein a biller or merchant can request a payment from a consumer through the use of a trusted app, most likely a banking app. RfP is primarily being implemented on top of real-time payments, which are continuing to grow and flourish as countries around the world develop and launch their real-time schemes as noted

 above. ACI is in a unique position to deliver this overlay service given our real-time payments software, our relationships with banks, merchants, and billers, and global real-time connectivity. 
 
 Several other factors related to our business may have a significant impact on our operating results from year to year. For example, the accounting rules governing the timing of revenue recognition are complex, and it can be difficult to estimate when we will recognize revenue generated by a given transaction. Factors such as creditworthiness of the customer and timing of transfer of control or acceptance of our products may cause revenues related to sales generated in one period to be deferred and recognized in later periods. For arrangements in which services revenue is deferred, related direct and incremental costs may also be deferred. Additionally, while the majority of our contracts are denominated in the U.S. dollar, a substantial portion of our sales are made, and some of our expenses are incurred, in the local currency of countries other than the United States. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates in a given period may result in the recognition of gains or losses for that period. 
 
 We continue to seek ways to grow through organic sources, partnerships, alliances, and acquisitions. We continually look for potential acquisitions designed to improve our solutions breadth or provide access to new markets. As part of our acquisition strategy, we seek acquisition candidates that are strategic, capable of being integrated into our operating environment, and accretive to our financial performance. 
 
 Backlog 
 Backlog is comprised of: 
 Committed Backlog, which includes (1) contracted revenue that will be recognized in future periods (contracted but not recognized) from software license fees, maintenance fees, service fees, and SaaS and PaaS fees specified in executed contracts (including estimates of variable consideration if required under ASC 606, Revenue From Contracts With Customers and included in the transaction price for those contracts, which includes deferred revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods and (2) estimated future revenues from software license fees, maintenance fees, services fees, and SaaS and PaaS fees specified in executed contracts. 
 Renewal Backlog, which includes estimated future revenues from assumed contract renewals to the extent we believe recognition of the related revenue will occur within the corresponding backlog period. 
 
 We have historically included assumed renewals in backlog estimates based upon automatic renewal provisions in the executed contract and our historic experience with customer renewal rates. 
 
 Our 60-month backlog estimates are derived using the following key assumptions: 
 License arrangements are assumed to renew at the end of their committed term or under the renewal option stated in the contract at a rate consistent with historical experience. If the license arrangement includes extended payment terms, the renewal estimate is adjusted for the effects of a significant financing component. 
 Maintenance fees are assumed to exist for the duration of the license term for those contracts in which the committed maintenance term is less than the committed license term. 
 SaaS and PaaS arrangements are assumed to renew at the end of their committed term at a rate consistent with our historical experiences. 
 Foreign currency exchange rates are assumed to remain constant over the 60-month backlog period for those contracts stated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. 
 Our pricing policies and practices are assumed to remain constant over the 60-month backlog period. 
 
 In computing our 60-month backlog estimate, the following items are specifically not taken into account: 
 Anticipated increases in transaction, account, or processing volumes by our customers. 
 Optional annual uplifts or inflationary increases in recurring fees. 
 Services engagements, other than SaaS and PaaS arrangements, are not assumed to renew over the 60-month backlog period. 
 The potential impact of consolidation activity within our markets and/or customers. 
 
 24 

Table of contents 

 We review our customer renewal experience on an annual basis. The impact of this review and subsequent updates may result in a revision to the renewal assumptions used in computing the 60-month backlog estimates. In the event a significant revision to renewal assumptions is determined to be necessary, prior periods will be adjusted for comparability purposes. 
 
 The following table sets forth our 60-month backlog estimate, by reportable segment, as of September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023 (in millions). Dollar amounts reflect foreign currency exchange rates as of each period end. This is a non-GAAP financial measure being presented to provide comparability across accounting periods. We believe this measure provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our financial performance. 
 September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 Banks 2,291 2,230 2,235 2,261 Merchants 757 740 741 754 Billers 3,395 3,398 3,505 3,505 Total 6,443 6,368 6,481 6,520 September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 Committed 2,204 2,362 2,223 2,178 Renewal 4,239 4,006 4,258 4,342 Total 6,443 6,368 6,481 6,520 
 
 Estimates of future financial results require substantial judgment and are based on several assumptions, as described above. These assumptions may turn out to be inaccurate or wrong for reasons outside of management s control. For example, our customers may attempt to renegotiate or terminate their contracts for many reasons, including mergers, changes in their financial condition, or general changes in economic conditions in the customer s industry or geographic location. We may also experience delays in the development or delivery of products or services specified in customer contracts, which may cause the actual renewal rates and amounts to differ from historical experiences. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates may also impact the amount of revenue recognized in future periods. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that amounts included in backlog estimates will generate the specified revenues or that the actual revenues will be generated within the corresponding 60-month period. Additionally, because certain components of Committed Backlog and all of Renewal Backlog estimates are operating metrics, the estimates are not required to be subject to the same level of internal review or controls as contracted but not recognized Committed Backlog.

 26 

Table of contents 

 SaaS and PaaS revenue increased 12.0 million, or 6 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 The increase was primarily driven by new customer go-lives since September 30, 2023, and higher transaction volumes during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 License Revenue 
 Customers purchase the right to license ACI software under multi-year, time-based software license arrangements that vary in length but are generally five years. Under these arrangements the software is installed at the customer s location (i.e. on-premise). Within these agreements are specified capacity limits typically based on customer transaction volume. ACI employs measurement tools that monitor the number of transactions processed by customers and if contractually specified limits are exceeded, additional fees are charged for the overage. Capacity overages may occur at varying times throughout the term of the agreement depending on the product, the size of the customer, and the significance of customer transaction volume growth. Depending on specific circumstances, multiple overages or no overages may occur during the term of the agreement. 
 
 Included in license revenue are license and capacity fees that are payable at the inception of the agreement. License revenue also includes license and capacity fees payable annually, quarterly, or monthly due to negotiated customer payment terms. The Company recognizes revenue in advance of billings for software license arrangements with extended payment terms and adjusts for the effects of the financing component, if significant. 
 
 License revenue increased 77.8 million, or 98 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023.

Merchants Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 26.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, due to a 16.3 million increase in revenue and a 9.7 million decrease in cash operating expense. 
 
 Billers Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, due to a 40.0 million increase in cash operating expense primarily for payment card interchange and other processing fees, partially offset by a 39.0 million increase in revenue. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General 
 Our primary liquidity needs are: (i) to fund normal operating expenses; (ii) to meet the interest and principal requirements of our outstanding indebtedness; and (iii) to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures, and lease payments. We believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flow generated by our operations, our cash and cash equivalents, and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility over the next 12 months and beyond. 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. As of September 30, 2024, we had 177.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which 68.2 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds were needed for our operations in the United States, we may potentially be required to accrue and pay foreign and U.S. state income taxes to repatriate these funds. As of September 30, 2024, only the earnings in our Indian foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested. We are also permanently reinvested for outside book/tax basis difference related to foreign subsidiaries. These outside basis differences could reverse through sales of the foreign subsidiaries, as well as various other events, none of which are considered probable as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Available Liquidity 
 The following table sets forth our available liquidity for the dates indicated (in thousands): September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 177,860 164,239 Availability under revolving credit facility 467,100 373,900 Total liquidity 644,960 538,139 
 
 The increase in total liquidity is primarily attributable to the 100.0 million increase in the maximum amount available under the revolving credit facility. 
 
 The Company and ACI Payments, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, maintain a 75.0 million uncommitted overdraft facility with Bank of America, N.A. The overdraft facility acts as a secured loan under the terms of the Credit Agreement to provide an additional funding mechanism for timing differences that can occur in the bill payment settlement process. As of September 30, 2024, the full 75.0 million was available. 
 
 On February 26, 2024, we entered into a Refinance Amendment (the Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of April 5, 2019 (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, including by the Amendment, the Credit Agreement with ACI Worldwide Corp and ACI Payments, Inc. as co-borrowers, the lenders, and Bank of America N.A, as administrative agent and lender. The Amendment, among other things, (i) provides a senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of 500 million, (ii) provides a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 600 million, and (iii) extends the maturity date of the Facilities to February 26, 2029. The proceeds of the borrowings under the Amendment, together with cash on hand, were used to refinance all outstanding borrowings and replace all existing revolving commitments under the Credit Agreement immediately prior to the date of the Amendment and will be used to provide ongoing working capital and for other general corporate purposes. 
 
 Stock Repurchase Program 
 Our board approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company, as market and business conditions warrant, to acquire its common stock and periodically authorizes additional funds for the program. In June 2024, the board approved the repurchase of the Company's common stock of up to 400.0 million in place of the remaining purchase amounts previously authorized.

 We repurchased 3,946,537 shares for 128.7 million under the program during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Under the program to date, we have repurchased 62,867,837 shares for approximately 1.1 billion. As of September 30, 2024, the maximum remaining amount authorized for purchase under the stock repurchase program was approximately 372.3 million. See Note 6, Common Stock and Treasury Stock, to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I of this Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table sets forth summarized cash flow data for the periods indicated (in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used by): Operating activities 232,266 82,774 Investing activities (31,641) (30,527) Financing activities (170,445) (47,773) 
 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 The primary source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers for purchase and renewal of licensed software products and various services including software and platform as a service, maintenance, and other professional services. Our primary uses of operating cash flows include employee expenditures, taxes, interest payments, and leased facilities. 
 
 Cash flows provided by operating activities were 149.5 million higher for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. Our operating cash flows for the current quarter increased primarily due to 20.8 million less in income tax payments, as well as cash flows generated from 104.6 million in net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a 1.1 million net loss for the same period in 2023. 
 
 Our cash flow from operating activities can fluctuate from period to period due to several factors, including: the timing of billings, which are typically higher in the third and fourth quarters in conjunction with sales timing and are variable based upon license renewal timing; collections, which will lag the quarters with higher billings; the timing and amounts of interest due to interest rate fluctuations and semi-annual Senior Notes interest payments; income tax and other payments; and our operating results. 
 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to the timing of our purchases and investments in capital and other assets, including strategic acquisitions, that support our growth. 
 During the first nine months of 2024, we used cash of 31.6 million to purchase software, property, and equipment, as compared to 30.5 million during the same period in 2023. 
 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt instruments and other debt, stock repurchases, and net proceeds related to employee stock programs. 
 
 During the first nine months of 2024, we repaid a net 47.8 million on the Term Loan under the Amendment, 9.3 million of other debt payments, and 5.1 million of debt issuance costs. In addition, we used 127.7 million to repurchase common stock and 9.3 million for the repurchase of stock-based compensation awards for tax withholdings. We received net proceeds of 7.0 million on the Revolving Credit Facility, proceeds of 4.1 million from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of common stock under our 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended, and 17.7 million for settlement assets and liabilities due to processing timing. During the first nine months of 2023, we repaid 53.6 million on the Term Loan, 12.5 million of other debt payments, and 2.2 million of debt issuance costs. In addition, we used 4.2 million for the repurchase of stock-based compensation awards for tax withholdings, and 4.6 million for settlement assets and liabilities due to processing timing. We received net proceeds of 24.0 million on the Revolving Credit Facility, and proceeds of 5.3 million from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of common stock under our 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended.

 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to the contractual obligations and commercial commitments disclosed in Item 7 of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions we believe to be proper and reasonable under the circumstances. We continually evaluate the appropriateness of estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 
 The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments, and assumptions, and that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, include the following: 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Intangible Assets and Goodwill 
 Business Combinations 
 Stock-Based Compensation 
 Accounting for Income Taxes 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates. Please refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, for a more complete discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Excluding the impact of changes in interest rates, inflationary pressures, and the uncertainty in the global financial markets, there have been no material changes to our market risk for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We conduct business in all parts of the world and are thereby exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The U.S. dollar is the single largest currency in which our revenue contracts are denominated. Any decline in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar results in our products and services being more expensive to a potential foreign customer. In those instances where our goods and services have already been sold, receivables may be more difficult to collect. Additionally, in jurisdictions where the revenue contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars and operating expenses are incurred in the local currency, any decline in the value of the U.S. dollar will have an unfavorable impact to operating margins. At times, we enter into revenue contracts that are denominated in the country s local currency, primarily in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, other European countries, Brazil, India, and Singapore. This practice serves as a natural hedge to finance the local currency expenses incurred in those locations. We have not entered into any foreign currency hedging transactions. We do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for speculation or arbitrage. 
 
 The primary objective of our cash investment policy is to preserve principal without significantly increasing risk. If we maintained similar cash investments for a period of one year based on our cash investments and interest rates at September 30, 2024, a hypothetical ten percent increase or decrease in effective interest rates would increase or decrease interest income by 0.2 million annually. 
 
 We had approximately 1.0 billion of debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024, with 602.9 million outstanding under our Credit Facility and 400.0 million in 2026 Notes. Our Credit Facility has a floating rate, which was 6.70 as of September 30, 2024. Our 2026 Notes are fixed-rate long-term debt obligations with a 5.750 interest rate. A hypothetical ten percent increase or decrease in effective interest rates would increase or decrease interest expense related to the Credit Facility by approximately 4.0 million.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 The following table provides information regarding our repurchases of common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024: Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Program Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Program July 1, 2024 through July 31, 2024 203,380 (1) 39.23 203,317 372,314,000 August 1, 2024 through August 31, 2024 32,411 (1) 46.69 372,314,000 September 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024 29,744 (1) 48.58 372,314,000 Total 265,535 41.19 203,317 
 
 (1) Pursuant to our 2016 and 2020 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan, we granted RSUs. Under each arrangement, shares are issued without direct cost to the employee. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, 191,285 shares of RSUs vested. We withheld 62,218 of those shares to pay the employees portion of the applicable minimum payroll withholding. 
 
 In 2005, our board approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us, as market and business conditions warrant, to acquire our common stock and periodically authorize additional funds for the program, with the intention of using existing cash and cash equivalents to fund these repurchases. In June 2024, the board approved the repurchase of the Company's common stock of up to 400.0 million, in place of the remaining purchase amounts previously authorized. As of September 30, 2024, the maximum remaining amount authorized for purchase under the stock repurchase program was approximately 372.3 million. 
 
 There is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares we will repurchase. Repurchased shares are returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock. In March 2005, our board approved a plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to facilitate the repurchase of shares of common stock under the existing stock repurchase program. Under our Rule 10b5-1 plan, we have delegated authority over the timing and amount of repurchases to an independent broker who does not have access to inside information about the Company. Rule 10b5-1 allows us, through the independent broker, to purchase shares at times when we ordinarily would not be in the market because of self-imposed trading blackout periods, such as the time immediately preceding the end of the fiscal quarter through a period of two business days following our quarterly earnings release.
