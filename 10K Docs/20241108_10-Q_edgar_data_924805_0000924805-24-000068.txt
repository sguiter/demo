 interest in Freedom Finance Ukraine LLC ("Freedom UA"), a Kyiv, Ukraine-based broker-dealer. The remaining interest in Freedom UA is controlled by Askar Tashtitov, the Company's president. The Company entered into a series of contractual arrangements with Freedom UA and Mr. Tashtitov, including a consulting services agreement, an operating agreement and an option agreement. Through March 31, 2023, the Company had consolidated Freedom UA into the financial statements of the Company. On October 19, 2022, Freedom UA was added to the Ukrainian government's sanctioned entities list, resulting in suspension of its brokerage license. Given the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the situation in Ukraine and based on the Company's management's belief that the Company does not maintain effective control over Freedom UA, the Company has accounted for the deconsolidation of Freedom UA since April 1, 2023 (the date of loss of control).

major reporting units have been established: brokerage, banking. insurance and other. The management team responsible for each business reviews financial information related to this reporting unit, including revenue, expenses, and market trends. 
 Goodwill has been allocated to each reporting unit based on its relative fair value at the time of acquisition or significant triggering events. The fair value allocation of goodwill to reporting units is periodically reassessed to ensure alignment with the Group's evolving organizational structure and operational dynamics. 
 
 Further details regarding the measurement of goodwill impairment and the results of impairment tests for each reporting unit are provided below. 
 
 The Company discloses information about its reporting units, the carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit, and the impairment losses recognized. The allocation of goodwill to reporting units ensures a focused evaluation of each unit's financial performance and facilitates the identification of potential impairment, enhancing the transparency and reliability of the Company's financial reporting.

The goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. If fair value exceeds the carrying amount, no impairment is recorded. 
 
 The amount of goodwill at September 30, 2024 increased compared to March 31, 2024, as a result of the acquisition of SilkNetCom LLP by Freedom Telecom Holding, which occurred after March 31, 2024.

 The fair value of securities is determined using observable market data based on recent trading activity. Where observable market data is unavailable due to a lack of trading activity, the Group utilizes internally developed models to estimate fair value and independent third parties to validate assumptions, when appropriate. Estimating fair value requires significant management judgment, including benchmarking to similar instruments with observable market data and applying appropriate discounts that reflect differences between the securities that the Group is valuing and the selected benchmark. Depending on the type of securities owned by the Group, other valuation methodologies may be required. 
 Measurement of fair value is classified within a hierarchy based upon the transparency of inputs used in the valuation of an asset or liability. Classification within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 
 The valuation hierarchy contains three levels: 
 Level 1 - Valuation inputs are unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

 Margin lending receivables are amounts owed to the Group from customers as a result of borrowings by such customers against the value of qualifying securities, primarily for the purpose of purchasing additional securities.

 The Group provides mortgage loans to borrowers on behalf of the JSC Kazakhstan Sustainability Fund (the "Program Operator") related to the state mortgage program "7-20-25" and transfers the rights to claim on the mortgage loans to the Program Operator. The proceeds received from these transfers are presented within funds received under state program for financing of mortgage loans in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Under this program, borrowers can receive a mortgage at an interest rate of for years, and the interest payments received by the Group are recognized as interest income in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Statements of Other Comprehensive Income. In accordance with the program and trust management agreement for the program, the Group services the transferred loans and remits all repayments of principal it receives plus of the interest received to the Program Operator. The interest paid to the Program Operator is recognized as interest expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Statements of Other Comprehensive Income. The remaining of the interest is retained by Group. Under the program and trust management agreement, the Group is required to repurchase the rights to make claims on the transferred loans when either loan principal repayments or interest payments are overdue 90 days or more. The repurchase of overdue loans is performed at the loans nominal value and is presented within repurchase of mortgage loans under the State Program in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
 
 Since the Group transfers the rights to make claims on the loans with recourse for loans that are more than 90 days past due, retains part of the interest received on the loans and agrees to service the loans after the sale of the loans to the Program Operator, the Company has determined that the Group retains control over the loans transferred and continues recognizing the loans, which are accounted for as secured borrowings of the Group in accordance with ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing. As the Company continues to recognize the loans as assets, it also recognizes the associated liability equal to the proceeds received from the Program Operator, which is presented separately as liability arising from continuing involvement in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. This liability accrues interest annually as described above. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024 , the corresponding liability amounte d to and , respectively.

 The Group has an agreement with FFIN Credit, a company established and controlled by FRHC's controlling shareholder, chairman and chief executive officer, Timur Turlov, to purchase uncollateralized retail loans from FFIN Credit. FFIN Credit is a non-bank credit institution that issues loans in Kazakhstan under simplified lending procedures. FFIN Credit was created as a pilot project to test and improve the scoring models used for qualifying and issuing loans. The principal operation of FFIN Credit is to provide loans to customers online using biometric identification and its proprietary scoring process. After completion of the pilot project, it is anticipated that FFIN Credit will be sold by Mr. Turlov to the Company. Freedom Bank KZ has legal ownership over the loans purchased from FFIN Credit. However, in accordance with U.S. GAAP requirements, the Group does not recognize those loans, since effective control over the transferred loans are maintained by FFIN Credit. Instead, the Group recognizes the loans receivable from FFIN Credit as right of claim for purchased retail loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheets within loans issued. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, right of claims for purchased retail loans amounted to and , respectively.

 the user experience but also aligns with our strategic goals. Customer satisfaction is improved through easy access to all banking and investment services in a single app, coupled with an intuitive interface and personalized recommendations. 
 
 Going forward, we are prioritizing the further development of our digital fintech ecosystem by integrating our online and mobile brokerage services, banking offerings, insurance products, payment processing systems, and online commercial ticketing services.

When achieving our strategic objectives, we rely heavily on information technology and its continuous development and innovation to offer our users a seamless customer interaction, meet their diverse needs, and ensure stringent adherence to regulatory requirements and information security standards. 
 In alignment with our digital fintech ecosystem strategy, we are expanding our business by entering the telecommunications market in Kazakhstan and regional media industry in Central Asia. We are seeking to establish a new independent telecommunications operator in Kazakhstan to provide a diverse range of telecommunications and telecommunications-related services to customers which may include, among others, high-quality internet connectivity, mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) services, WiFi access, over-the-top (OTT) streaming, internet protocol television (IPTV), traffic transit for operators and cloud solutions, subject to obtaining applicable licenses, acquisitions of telecom assets or entering into partnerships where required. Our new telecommunications business is operated by Freedom Telecom, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Freedom Holding Corp. incorporated under the laws of the AIFC. Pursuing further development of our telecom business, on September 17, 2024 we completed the acquisition of a 100 interest in SilkNetCom LLP for a purchase price of approximately 23.9 million. SilkNetCom LLP is a company specializing in provider services, IT and construction of telecommunications networks in private and public sectors. See Note 22 Acquisitions of subsidiaries to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Our strategy and budget for Freedom Telecom are currently being reassessed and are subject to revisions, which may be material. During fiscal 2024, we established Freedom Media LLP ("Freedom Media") as a subsidiary of Freedom Telecom that is intended to become a national media platform in Kazakhstan offering tailored streaming services to the Kazakhstan and broader Central Asia markets. This platform is expected to provide unlimited access to a diverse collection of TV shows, movies, documentaries, and exclusive content across multiple genres. 
 Credit Ratings 
 On June 28, 2024, S P Global Ratings affirmed the long-term credit rating of Freedom Holding Corp. at the "B-" level and long-term and short-term credit ratings of Freedom KZ, Freedom EU, Freedom Global and Freedom Bank KZ at the "B/B" level. The ratings of Freedom KZ and Freedom Bank KZ on the national scale were increased from "kzBB+" to "kzBB -", and S P Global Ratings revised the outlook on Freedom Holding Corp. from negative to stable and the outlook on its core subsidiaries from negative to positive. The positive outlooks on the Freedom Holding Corp.'s subsidiaries reflect S P's view that easing financial system risk in Kazakhstan and a further strengthening of the Group's risk management and capitalization could support its franchise over the next 12 months. The stable outlook on Freedom Holding Corp. reflects S P's expectation that an upgrade on the holding company is unlikely even if it views the Group's creditworthiness overall as having strengthened. 
 
 On July 2, 2024, S P Global Ratings revised its ratings outlook on Freedom Life to stable from negative. At the same time, S P Global Ratings affirmed their 'BB' long-term issuer credit and financial strength ratings on Freedom Life. S P Global Ratings also raised the Kazakhstan national scale rating on Freedom Life to 'kzAA-' from 'kzA+'. S P Global Ratings consider that Freedom Life remains a strategically important subsidiary of the Group. This is based on Freedom Life's increasing importance to the Group's operations and track record of collaboration with other Group members. S P Global Ratings continue to view Freedom Life as an insulated entity due to strong regulatory oversight and its operational independence from the parent.

 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS 
 
 The highlights of our consolidated results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 are as follows: 
 
 We had total revenues, net of 580.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 435.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase between the two quarters was primarily attributable to the following: 
 
 Our insurance underwriting income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 160.3 million, an increase of 102.4 million or 177 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was driven by the expansion of our insurance operations such as in the pension annuity and accident insurance between the two quarters. 
 
 We had a net gain on trading securities of 68.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a net gain on trading securities of 50.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The majority of the net gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to the increase in the market prices of Kazakhstan sovereign bonds held in our proprietary portfolio during the quarter. 
 
 Our fee and commission income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 121.1 million, an increase of 9.3 million, or 8 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was mainly attributable to an increase in fee and commission income from brokerage services, which increase was offset in part by decreases in fee and commission income from bank services, payment processing, underwriting and market-making services and other fee and commission income. 
 
 We had a net gain on derivatives for the three months ended September 30, 2024 in the amount of 6.3 million, an increase of 4.9 million, or 358 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The gain for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was due to revaluation of currency swaps. 
 
 The foregoing increases in revenues were offset in part by a decrease in our interest income to 210.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 213.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to decrease in interest income on trading securities. 
 
 We had total expense of 452.4 million, for the three months ended September 30,2024, as compared to 300.9 million for the three months ended September 30,2023. The increase was mainly attributable to increases in fee and commission expense, insurance claims incurred (net of reinsurance), payroll and bonuses, general and administrative expense and advertising expense. 
 
 We had net income of 114.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 115.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our Brokerage, Banking, Insurance and Other segments contributed 85.6 million, 45.7 million, 14.8 million of net income and a net loss of 31.6 million, respectively, to our total net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Our total assets increased to 8.8 billion as of September 30, 2024 from 8.3 billion as of March 31, 2024. 
 
 We had approximately 555,000 total retail brokerage customers as of September 30, 2024 as compared to approximately 530,000 as of March 31, 2024. We had approximately 1,202,000 banking customers at our Freedom Bank KZ subsidiary as of September 30, 2024 as compared to approximately 904,000 as of March 31, 2024.

 For the three months ended September 30,2024, total fee and commission income was 121.1 million, an increase of 9.3 million, or 8 , as compared to fee and commission income of 111.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Fee and commission income from brokerage services for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 107.4 million, representing a 27 increase as compared to 84.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of retail brokerage customers from 434,000 as of September 30, 2023 to 555,000 as of September 30, 2024. The increase in the number of customers was attributable in part to the migration of customers from our affiliate FST Belize to brokerage companies within our Group between the two quarters. The increase was offset in part by a decrease in fee and commission income from brokerage services generated from FST Belize between the two quarters, as our omnibus brokerage account arrangement with FST Belize was wound down and customers of FST Belize closed their accounts at FST Belize and opened accounts with brokerage companies within our Group. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we earned fee and commission income from a market maker customer at our Freedom Global subsidiary in an amount of 71.4 million, representing 59 of our total fee and commission income for that quarter. 
 
 Fee and commission income from payment processing decreased to 6.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 10.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 4.3 million decrease is attributable to a decrease in transaction volumes between the two quarters, which was in turn due to the cessation of operations of one of our counterparties, which previously contributed a substantial transaction volume. 
 
 Fee and commission income from banking services decreased to 1.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 9.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 7.4 million or 80 . The decrease in fee and commission income from banking services was primarily due to a 5.4 million decrease in commissions generated on transfer and payment processing, which was a result of a decrease in the volume of transfer and payment processing transactions between the two quarters. 
 
 Fee and commission income from underwriting and market-making activities decreased by 58 to 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by a lower volume of underwriting transactions for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Other fee and commission income decreased by 3 to 4.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 , due to a decrease in agency fees generated by our online travel ticket aggregator subsidiary. 
 Net gain on trading securities 
 We had a net gain on trading securities of 68.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 17.5 million as compared to a net gain of 50.8 million or the three months ended September 30, 2023. The following table sets forth information regarding our net gains on trading activities during the three months ended September 30,2024 and 2023: (amounts in thousands)

 41,058 9,713 50,771 
 During the three months ended September 30,2024, we had a realized gain on trading securities of 2.4 million, which is attributable to Kazakhstan sovereign bonds sold during the three months ended September 30,2024. Also, we recognized an unrealized net gain of 65.9 million during the same period due to an increase in the value of securities positions we held as of September 30, 2024. The majority of the unrealized net gain is attributable to Kazakhstan sovereign bonds. 
 During the three months ended September 30,2023, we had a realized gain on trading securities of 41.1 million, which is attributable to Kazakhstan sovereign bonds sold during three months ended September 30, 2023. We had an unrealized net gain in the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to securities positions we continued to hold at September 30, 2023, having appreciated by 9.7 million. The majority of the unrealized net gain comes from the appreciated shares of KazMunayGaz and Kazakhstan sovereign bonds. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, KazMunayGas shares increased in value due to an increase in oil prices during such quarter. The sharp decline in the

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had interest income of 210.3 million, representing a decrease of 2.7 million, or 1 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in interest income was primarily attributable to decrease in interest income on trading securities. Interest income on trading securities decreased by 9.0 million, or 8 , as a result of a decrease in the total size of our trading portfolio and an decrease in the amount of bonds we held as a percentage of our total trading portfolio between the two periods. Interest income on loans to customers increased by 6.5 million, or 15 , compared to the three months ending September 30, 2023 due to the growth of Freedom Bank KZ's customer loan portfolio between the two quarters. Interest income on margin loans to customers decreased by 1.7 million, or 4 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to a decrease in the usage of margin loans for trades by our clients between the two quarters. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we earned interest income

 from margin lending from a market maker customer at our Freedom Global subsidiary in an amount of approximately 7.6 million, representing 4 of our total interest income from margin lending for that quarter.

 Net gain on foreign exchange operations 
 For the three months ended September 30,2024, we realized a net gain on foreign exchange operations of 6.5 million compared to a net loss of 3.7 million for the three months ended September 30,2023. The net gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is mainly attributable to a 16.9 million gain on sale and purchases of foreign currency for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which was partially offset by a translation loss of 10.4 million for that quarter. This increase between the two quarters is not only due to there having been more trading gain transactions than loss transactions during the three months ended September 30, 2024 but also due to a 78 increase in Freedom Bank's overall transaction volume with foreign currency between the two quarters. 
 Net gain on derivatives 
 For the three months ended September 30,2024, we had net gain on derivatives of 6.3 million compared to a net gain of 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30,2023. The increase in the amount of net gain was primarily attributable to our subsidiary, Freedom Bank KZ, which had a realized net gain of 9.9 million for the three months ended September 30,2024, as compared to an unrealized net gain of 3.1 million for the three months ended September 30,2023 due to a positive revaluation of currency swaps. Freedom Bank KZ engages in currency swaps to diversify its funding sources. 
 Insurance underwriting income 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had insurance underwriting income of 160.3 million, an increase of 102.4 million, or 177 , as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to a 109.8 million, or 183 , increase in insurance underwriting income from written insurance premiums for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to the expansion of our insurance operations such as in the pension annuity and accident insurance between the two quarters. This increase in income from written insurance premiums was partially offset by a 1.2 million increase in reinsurance premiums ceded for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The following table sets out information on our insurance underwriting income for the periods presented.

 Fee and commission expense increased by 59.2 million or 187 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is mainly attributable to an increase of agency fees expense of 53.9 million or 268 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in agency fees expenses was due to an increase in insurance products sales by Freedom Life, which are outsourced to outside agents. 
 Interest expense 
 During the three months ended September 30,2024, we had a 14.7 million, or 11 , decrease in interest expense as compared to the three months ended September 30,2023. The decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to a 30.9 million, or 26 , decrease in interest expense on short-term financing through securities repurchase agreements due to a decrease in the volume of such financing. This was partially offset by 6.0 million increase in interest expense on debt securities issued and 5.8 million increase in interest expense on customer deposits. Compared to the three months ended September 30,2023, we decreased our volume of short-term financing through securities repurchase agreements primarily in order to fund our investment portfolio. The increase in interest on customer deposits was a result of growth of our banking client base due to the expansion of the operations of Freedom Bank KZ between the two periods.

 Insurance claims incurred, net of reinsurance 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a 32.7 million, or 96 , increase in insurance claims incurred, net of reinsurance, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to the general expansion of our insurance operations between the two quarters. 
 Payroll and bonuses 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had payroll and bonuses expense of 66.2 million, representing an increase of 26.2 million or 66 compared to payroll and bonuses expense of 40.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in payroll and bonus expenses is primarily attributable to increased salary and bonus amounts between the two quarters. The increase was also due to the expansion of our workforce through acquisitions, establishment of new subsidiaries and hiring. 
 
 Professional services 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our professional services expense was 8.2 million, representing a decrease by 3.7 million or 31 compared to 12.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in expenses for auditing services rendered by our external auditors due to timing differences in the provision of such services. The decrease was partially offset by increases in certain professional services expenses, including consulting and legal fees, attributable to the overall growth of our company organically and through acquisitions between the two periods. 
 
 Stock compensation expense 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our stock compensation expense was 12.1 million, representing an increase of 11.0 million or 1069 compared to stock compensation expense of 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is attributable to new stock grants the majority of which vested on the date of issuance during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the partial amortization of stock grants which were granted in March, April and June 2024. 
 
 Advertising expense 
 
 Advertising expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 20.0 million, representing an increase of 11.4 million or 132 compared to 8.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in advertising expenses by Freedom Europe of 9.0 million attributable to marketing campaigns that were initiated during fiscal 2024 and continued in the three months ended September 30, 2024. This increase consisted of an increase of approximately 4.6 million on advertising and an increase of 3.3 million on influencer and affiliates advertising. There was also an increase of 1.3 million attributable to Freedom Advertising, an advertising company, out of which 1.0 million was paid to advertising contractors and the remainder paid to Yandex Kazakhstan for advertisement placement. There was also an increase of 1.2 million of advertising expenses attributable to FRHC due to its focus on brand visibility and enhanced marketing efforts. 
 
 General and administrative expense 
 
 General and administrative expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 53.2 million, representing an increase of 23.6 million or 80 compared to general and administrative expense of 29.6 million for the three months 
 71 

Table of Contents 

 ended September 30, 2023. The increase is attributable to the general expansion and development of our business between the two quarters. The main factors contributing to the increase were increases in charity and sponsorship, other operating expenses, rent expenses, lease depreciation and software support. Our charity and sponsorship expense increased by 13.8 million due to several charitable contributions through our subsidiaries during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The most significant contributions were made to the Kazakhstan Chess Federation, Sport Programming Federation and construction work in Konayev city. Other operating expenses increased by 2.8 million mainly due to an increase of other operating expenses at Freedom Bank KZ from banking and other overhead costs. The increase of 1.6 million in rent expense was driven by the addition of new subsidiaries between the two quarters and the overall growth of our operations. Lease depreciation expenses increased by 1.2 million, attributable to our overall growth and the need for more office space. The expansion of our workforce and the establishment of new offices required additional leasing, leading to higher depreciation costs. Software support expenses increased by 0.9 million mainly due to the support of licensed software fee and other software systems. 
 Provision for allowance for expected credit losses 
 
 We recognized provision for allowance for credit losses in the amount of 10.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to provision for allowance for credit losses of 4.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses was 48.7 million, compared to 43.6 million as of March 31, 2024. The increase between the two periods is attributable to provisions for uncollateralized bank customer loans. The increase in provisions is primarily attributable to the deterioration of the quality of the portfolio for the digital loans for individual entrepreneurs. The effect of the increase in provisions is partially offset by the revision of the approach to calculating reserve rates for collective loans. 
 Income tax expense 
 We had income before income tax of 128.5 million and 134.7 million for the three months ended September 30,2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30,2024, and September 30, 2023 was 14.0 million and 19.2 million, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in our income before income tax between the two quarters. In addition, our effective tax rate during the three months ended September 30,2024, decreased to 10.9 , from 14.3 during the three months ended September 30,2023, as a result of changes in the composition of the revenues we realized from our operating activities, the tax treatment of those revenues in the various jurisdictions where our subsidiaries operate, and the incremental U.S. GILTI tax. 
 Net income 
 As a result of the foregoing factors, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had net income of 114.5 million compared to 115.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 1 . Our Brokerage, Banking, Insurance and Other segments contributed 85.6 million, 45.7 million, 14.8 million net income and 31.6 million net loss, respectively, to our total net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Non-controlling interest 
 As of September 30, 2024, FRHC hel d a 94.84 ownership interest in Arbuz and a 90.0 ownership interest in ReKassa. The remaining 5.19 of the ownership interest in Arbuz and 10.0 of the ownership interest in ReKassa are recognized as non-controlling interests in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Statements of Other Comprehensive Income, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
 Net loss attributable to non-controlling interest was 0.2 million and 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Foreign currency translation adjustments, net of tax 
 Due to a 2.1 depreciation of the Kazakhstan tenge against the U.S. dollar during the three months ended September 30,2024, we realized a foreign currency translation loss of 20.0 million for the three months ended September 30,

 Fee and commission income from brokerage services for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was 200.5 million, representing a 43 increase as compared to 139.8 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of retail brokerage customers from 434,000 as of September 30, 2023 to 555,000 as of September 30, 2024. The increase in the number of customers was attributable in part to the migration of customers from FST Belize to brokerage companies within our Group between the two periods. The increase was offset in part by a decrease in fee and commission income from brokerage services generated from FST Belize between the two periods, as our omnibus brokerage arrangement with FST Belize was wound down and customers of FST Belize closed their accounts at FST Belize and opened accounts with brokerage companies within our Group. During the six months ended September 30, 2024, we earned fee and commission income from a market maker customer at our Freedom Global subsidiary in an amount of 136.3 million, representing 58 of our total fee and commission income for that period. 
 
 Fee and commission income from payment processing decreased to 14.5 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 from 28.3 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The 13.8 million decrease is attributable to a significant reduction in transaction volumes between the two periods, which was in turn due to the cessation of operations of one of our counterparties, which previously contributed a substantial transaction volume. 
 
 Fee and commission income from banking services decreased by 17.8 million or 80 to 4.4 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in fee and commission income from banking services was primarily due to a 15 million decrease in commissions generated on transfer and payment processing, which was a result of a lower volume of transfer and payment processing transactions between the two periods. 
 
 Fee and commission income from underwriting and market-making activities decreased by 5.8 million i n the six months ended September 30, 2023 or 50 to 5.9 million, driven by a lower volume of underwriting transactions for the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Other fee and commission income increased by 33 to 11.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 8.4 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023 , due to an increase in agency fees generated by our online travel ticket aggregator subsidiary between the two periods, which was in turn due to an increase in usage and demand of such services. 
 Net gain on trading securities 
 We had a net gain on trading securities of 16.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 66.4 million as compared to a net gain of 82.6 million or the six months ended September 30, 2023. The following table sets forth information regarding our net gains and losses on trading activities during the six months ended September 30,2024 and 2023: (amounts in thousands) Realized Net Gain Unrealized Net Gain Net Gain Six months ended September 30, 2024

 51,923 30,664 82,587 
 During the six months ended September 30, 2024, we had a realized gain on trading securities of 15.2 million, which is attributable to Kazakhstan sovereign bonds sold during the six months ended September 30, 2024. Also, we recognized an unrealized net gain of 1.0 million during the same period due to the increase in the value of securities positions we held as of September 30, 2024. The majority of the unrealized net gain is attributable to Kazakhstan sovereign bonds, as a consequence of market price increase. 
 During the six months ended September 30, 2023, we had a realized gain on trading securities of 51.9 million, which is attributable to debt securities of the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Kazakhstan sold during the six months ended September 30, 2023. We had an unrealized net gain in the six months ended September 30, 2023, due to securities positions we continued to hold at September 30, 2023, having appreciated by 30.7 million. The majority of the unrealized net gain was attributable to appreciated debt securities of the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Kazakhstan, which appreciation was primarily due to a decline in the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan's base interest rate during the six months ended September 30, 2023.

 For the six months ended September 30, 2024, we had interest income of 436.3 million, representing an increase of 73.9 million, or 20 , compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest income was primarily attributable to increases in interest income on margin loans to customers, loans to customers and trading securities.

Interest income on loans to customers increased by 27.6 million, or 37 , compared to the six months ending September 30, 2023 due to the growth of Freedom Bank KZ's customer loan portfolio between the two periods. Interest income on margin loans to customers increased by 32.2 million, or 54 , compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023, due to an increase in the usage of margin loans for trades by our clients between the two periods.

 Net gain on foreign exchange operations 
 For the six months ended September 30, 2024 , we realized a net gain on foreign exchange operations of 14.6 million compared to a net gain of 15.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net gain can be attributed to a gain of 29.6 million on purchases and sale of foreign currency that was partially offset by a translation loss of 15.0 million, mainly due to the 95 increase of Freedom Bank's volume of currency transactions compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net gain on derivatives 
 For the six months ended September 30, 2024, we had net gain on derivatives of 18.8 million compared to a net loss of 29.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024. The change was primarily attributable to our subsidiary, Freedom Bank KZ, which had an unrealized net gain of 4.0 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 due to a positive revaluation of currency swaps, as compared to a realized net loss of 30.1 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023 due to a negative revaluation of currency swaps. Freedom Bank KZ engages in currency swaps to diversify its funding sources. 
 Insurance underwriting income 
 For the six months ended September 30, 2024, we had insurance underwriting income of 289.8 million, an increase of 186.9 million, or 182 , as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to a 203.6 million, or 179 , increase in insurance underwriting income from written insurance premiums for the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023, due to the expansion of our insurance operations such as pension annuity and accident insurance classes between the two periods. This increase in income from written insurance premiums was partially offset by a 2.3 million increase in reinsurance premiums ceded for the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. The following table sets out information on our insurance underwriting income for the periods presented.

 expense of 100.3 million or 260 compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023 and other commission expenses of 11.5 million, compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in agency fees expenses was due to an increase in insurance products sales by Freedom Life, which are outsourced to outside agents. The increase in other commission expenses is attributable to increased commissions paid associated with Paybox consistent with the growth of its business activities between the two periods, following our acquisition of it in the fourth periods of fiscal 2023. 
 Interest expense 
 During the six months ended September 30, 2024, we had a 36.0 million, or 15 , increase in interest expense as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to a 24.1 million, or 373 , increase in interest expense on margin lending payable due to an increase in the volume of such financing, and a 13.4 million, or 40 , increase in interest expense on customer deposits. Compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest on customer deposits was a result of growth of our banking client base due to the expansion of the operations of Freedom Bank KZ between the two periods.

 Insurance claims incurred, net of reinsurance 
 For the six months ended September 30, 2024, we had a 58.5 million, or 105 , increase in insurance claims incurred, net of reinsurance, as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to the general expansion of our insurance operations between the two periods. 
 Payroll and bonuses 
 
 For the six months ended September 30, 2024, we had payroll and bonuses expense of 123.7 million, representing an increase of 52.1 million or 73 compared to payroll and bonuses expense of 71.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in payroll and bonus expenses is primarily attributable to increased salary and bonus amounts between the two periods. The increase was also due to the expansion of our workforce through acquisitions, establishment of new subsidiaries and hiring. 
 
 Professional services 
 
 For the six months ended September 30, 2024, our professional services expense was 15.5 million , representing a decrease by 3.1 million or 16 compared to 18.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in expenses for auditing services rendered by our external auditors due to timing differences in the provision of such services. The decrease was partially offset by increases in certain professional services expenses, including consulting and legal fees, attributable to the overall growth of our company organically and through acquisitions between the two periods. 
 
 Stock compensation expense 
 
 For the six months ended September 30, 2024, our stock compensation expense 22.7 million, representing a increase of 20.4 million or 901 compared to stock compensation expense of 2.3 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is attributable to new stock grants the majority of which vested on the date of issuance during the six months ended September 30, 2024 and the partial amortization of stock grants which were granted in March., April and June 2024. 
 
 Advertising expense 
 
 Advertising expense for the six months ended September 30, 2024, was 37.3 million, representing an increase of 20.5 million or 123 compared to 16.7 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in advertising expenses by Freedom Europe of 15.4 million attributable to marketing campaigns that were initiated during fiscal 2024 and continued in the six months ended September 30, 2024. This increase consisted of an increase of advertising expense, influencer and affiliates advertising expense, marketing and sponsorship expense. There was also an increase of 2.3 million attributable to Freedom Advertising, an advertising company, due to marketing expenditures to third party contractors. There was also an increase of 1.7 million from FRHC due to the company's focus on the brand visibility and enhanced marketing efforts. 
 
 General and administrative expense 
 
 General and administrative expense for the six months ended September 30, 2024, was 98.6 million, representing an increase of 44.5 million or 42 compared to general and administrative expense of 54.1 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. This increase is attributable to the general expansion and development of our business between 
 80 

Table of Contents 

 the two periods. The main factors contributing to the increase were increases in other operating expenses, charity and sponsorship, software support, depreciation and amortization expense and lease depreciation. Other operating expenses increased by 8.1 million mainly due to an increase of other operating expenses at Freedom Bank KZ from banking and other overhead costs. Our charity and sponsorship expense increased by 18.1 million due to several charitable contributions through our subsidiaries during the six months ended September 30, 2024. The most significant contributions were made to the Kazakhstan Chess Federation, Sport Programming Federation and construction work in Konayev city. Taxes, other than income tax, increased by 1.5 million mainly due to the general growth of the Group, including the addition of new subsidiaries. The expansion of our business operations resulted in higher tax liabilities, reflecting our broader market presence and increased operational scale. Software support expenses increased by 3.5 million mainly due to the support of licensed software fee and other software systems. The increases of 1.4 million in depreciation and amortization expense and 2.9 million in rent expense were driven by the addition of new subsidiaries between the two periods and the overall growth of our operations. The integration of new subsidiaries required substantial investments in new technology and infrastructure, leading to higher depreciation and amortization costs. Lease depreciation expenses increased by 2.2 million, attributable to our overall growth and the need for more office space. 
 Provision for allowance for expected credit losses 
 We recognized allowance for credit losses in the amount of 8.7 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to allowance for credit losses of 19.0 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is attributable to provisions for car loans. The decrease in provisions for car loans is primarily attributable to a change in estimates related to input data obtained from the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan. 
 Income tax expense 
 We had income before income tax of 170.1 million and 219.3 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. Income tax expense for the six months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023 was 21.3 million and 35.9 million, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in our income before income tax between the two periods. In addition, our effective tax rate during the six months ended September 30, 2024, decreased to 13 , from 16 during the six months September 30, 2023, as a result of changes in the composition of the revenues we realized from our operating activities, the tax treatment of those revenues in the various jurisdictions where our subsidiaries operate, and the incremental U.S. GILTI tax. 
 Net income 
 As a result of the foregoing factors, for the six months ended September 30, 2024, we had net income of 148.7 million compared to 183.4 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 19 . Our Brokerage, Banking, Insurance and Other segments contributed 155.3 million, 17.2 million, 28.6 million net income and 52.3 million net loss, respectively, to our total net income for the six months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Non-controlling interest 
 As of September 30, 2024, FRHC hel d a 94.84 ownership interest in Arbuz and a 90.0 ownership interest in ReKassa. The remaining 5.19 of the ownership interest in Arbuz and 10.0 of the ownership interest in ReKassa are recognized as non-controlling interests in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Statements of Other Comprehensive Income, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
 Net loss attributable to non-controlling interest was 0.3 million and 0.5 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Foreign currency translation adjustments, net of tax 
 Due to a 8 depreciation of the Kazakhstan tenge against the U.S. dollar during the six months ended September 30, 2024, we realized a foreign currency translation loss of 85.8 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 since most of our Group's companies use the Kazakhstan tenge as their functional currency, as compared to a foreign currency translation loss of 31.7 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023.

 Brokerage Segment 
 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024, in our Brokerage segment we had an increase in total revenue, net, primarily driven by an increase in fee and commission income. Fee and commission income in this segment increased, primarily due to a general increase in brokerage activity between the two quarters. The revenue increase were partially offset by a decrease in net gain on trading securities, interest income and net gain on foreign currency exchange. 
 
 Banking Segment 
 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024, total revenue, net in the Banking segment increased as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, mainly attributable to net gain on trading securities, net gain on derivatives and decrease in net loss on foreign exchange operations in this segment in the three months ended September 30, 2024. These increases were partially offset by the decrease of fee and commission income in this segment in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Insurance Segment 
 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024, total revenue, net in the Insurance segment increased mainly due to an increase in insurance underwriting income, reflecting the overall growth of our insurance operations between the two quarters. 
 
 Other Segment 
 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024, total revenue, net in the Other segment increased mostly due to an increase of 8.6 million in net gain on foreign exchange operations mainly from FRHC, which was attributable to an appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Kazakhstan tenge between the two quarters. There was also an increase in the other income of 5.1 million, as well as an increase in 2.3 million from net gain on trading securities. The overall increase was offset by a decrease of 6.5 million in fee and commission income.

 In the three months ended September 30, 2024, total expenses, net in our Other segment increase was driven by increases of 16.2 million in general and administrative expense, mainly due to the charity and sponsorship expense by Freedom Shapagat, a non-profit corporate fund. There was also an increase of 9.1 million in payroll and bonuses, due to the overall growth of the company. There was also an increase of 6.3 million in interest expense from Freedom SPC debt securities issued. We have also seen an increase of 3.7 million in fee and commission expense mainly from Paybox and its payment processing activity. There was also an increase of 2.8 million, mostly from the activity of Freedom Advertising and FRHC. The overall increase was offset by a 4.2 million decrease in professional services.

 Brokerage Segment 
 
 In the six months ended September 30, 2024, in our Brokerage segment we had a significant increase in total revenue, net, primarily driven by an increase in interest income. This was largely due to increases in interest accrued on securities held in our trading portfolio and in interest accrued on margin loans to customers within this segment. Fee and commission income in this segment also increased, primarily due to a general increase in brokerage activity between the two periods. Additionally, there was an increase in net gain on foreign exchange operations and other income. These revenue increases were partially offset by a decrease in net gain on trading securities. 
 
 Banking Segment 
 
 In the six months ended September 30, 2024, total revenue, net in the Banking segment increased as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023, mainly attributable to increase in interest income and net gain on derivatives in this segment in the six months ended September 30, 2024. These increases were partially offset by the effects of net loss on foreign exchange operations, and net gain on trading securities in this segment in the six months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Insurance Segment 
 
 In the six months ended September 30, 2024, total revenue, net in the Insurance segment increased mainly due to an increase in insurance underwriting income, reflecting the overall growth of our insurance operations between the two periods. However, these increases were partially offset by the effects of decrease of net gain on trading securities and interest income. 
 
 Other Segment 
 
 In the six months ended September 30, 2024, total revenue, net in the Other segment increased mostly due to an increase of 25.6 million in net gain on foreign exchange operations mainly from FRHC, which was attributable to an appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Kazakhstan tenge between the two periods. There was also an increase of 11.2 million due to the increase in other income. These increases were partially offset by a 13.4 million decrease in fee and commission income attributable to a decrease in Paybox's transaction volumes due to the cessation of operation of a counterparty that contributed significantly to its transaction volume. There was also a decrease in interest income of 0.5 million and a net loss on derivative of 0.5 million. 
 
 Total expenses associated with our segments are summarized in the following table:

 Brokerage Segment 
 
 In the six months ended September 30, 2024, total expenses, net in our Brokerage segment increased primarily due to an increase in interest expense, which was in turn due to interest paid on securities repurchase agreements and fee and commission expense, which was in turn mainly due to agency fees expense. Additionally, there was an increase in payroll and bonuses, reflecting our efforts to attract and retain top talent. Advertising expenses in this segment also increased as we intensified our marketing efforts to expand our client base. Furthermore, stock compensation expenses increased, attributable to new stock grants and partial amortization of old stock grants. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses.

These increases were partially offset by decrease in fee and commission expense and allowance for credit losses. 
 
 Insurance Segment 
 
 In the six months ended September 30, 2024, total expenses, net in our Insurance segment increased mainly due to increase in fee and commission expense from agency fees, insurance claims incurred, net of reinsurance, general and administrative expense, payroll and bonuses and stock compensation expense. These increases are attributable to the overall growth of our insurance operations between the two periods. However, these increases were partially offset by the effects of decrease in interest expense. 
 
 Other Segment 
 
 In the six months ended September 30, 2024, total expenses, net in our Other segment increase was driven by increases in payroll and bonuses, general and administrative expenses, interest expense and fee and commission expense. There was a 22.1 million increase in payroll and bonuses in the Other segment which is mostly attributable to the overall growth of our operations as well as the addition of new subsidiaries. The increase of 25.1 million in general and administrative expense in the Other segment was also mainly attributable to our overall growth and the addition of new subsidiaries. In particular, 12.3 million was attributable to our Shapagat subsidiary due to it charity and sponsorship expenses. Interest expense in the Other segment increased by 10.9 million, mainly attributable to an increase in interest expense on loans received by FRHC. There was an increase of 9.4 million in fee and commission expense in the Other segment, which is mostly attributable to increased bank commission expense for payment services due to an increase of payment processing operations at certain Paybox subsidiaries There was also an increase of 5.5 million from advertising expense, mainly from the activity of Freedom Advertising and FRHC. The increase was partially offset by a decrease of 3.8 million in professional services from FRHC. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet our potential cash requirements for general business purposes. During the periods covered in this quarterly report our operations were primarily funded through a combination of existing cash on hand, cash generated from operations, returns generated from our proprietary trading and proceeds from the sale of bonds and other borrowings. 
 We regularly monitor and manage our leverage and liquidity risk through various committees and processes we have established to maintain compliance with net capital and capital adequacy requirements imposed on securities brokerages and banks in jurisdictions where we do business. We assess our leverage and liquidity risk based on considerations and assumptions of market factors, as well as other factors, including the amount of available liquid capital (i.e., the amount of cash and cash equivalents not invested in our operating business). While we are confident in the risk management monitoring and processes we have in place, a significant portion of our trading securities and cash and cash equivalents are subject to collateralization agreements. This significantly enhances our risk of loss in the event financial markets move against our positions. When this occurs our liquidity, capitalization and business can be negatively impacted. Certain market conditions can impact the liquidity of our assets, potentially requiring us to hold positions longer than anticipated. Our liquidity, capitalization, projected return on investment and results of operations can be significantly impacted by market events over which we have no control, and which can result in disruptions to our investment strategy for our assets. 
 We maintain a majority of our tangible assets in cash and securities that are readily convertible to cash, including governmental and quasi-governmental debt and highly liquid corporate equities and debt. Our financial instruments and other asset positions are stated at fair value and should generally be readily marketable in most market conditions. The following table sets out certain information regarding our assets as of the dates presented:

 Net Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities 
 During the six months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 223.4 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of 450.2 million during the six months ended September 30, 2023. During the six months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in investing activities was used for the issuance of loans, net of repayment by customers, in the amount of 95.1 million, the purchase of fixed assets in the amount of 33.6 million, and purchase of available-for-sale securities, net of proceeds, in the amount of 74.9 million. During the six months ended September 30, 2024 cash used for the issuance of loans, net of repayment decreased by 348.8 million compared to the six months September 30, 2023, due to the decline in the volume of loans issued during the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. This shift is attributed to substantial growth in the Freedom Bank KZ's loan portfolio over the six months ended September 30, 2023, driven by new banking products, partnership agreements, and effective advertising campaigns. 
 Net Cash Flows From Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash flows from financing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was 370.3 million compared to net cash flow from financing activities in amount of 1.7 billion during the six months ended September 30, 2023. Cash Flow from financing activities during the six months ended September 30, 2024 consisted principally of bank customer deposits received in the amount of 308.7 million, net proceeds from obligations under securities repurchase agreements in amount of 30.3 million, net proceeds from loans received in amount of 17.4 million and mortgage loans sold to JSC Kazakhstan Sustainability Fund as the Program Operator, net of repurchase, under the state mortgage program "7-20-25" in the amount of 14.0 million. During the six months ended September 30, 2024 cash flow from financing activities decreased by 1.3 billion compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily attributable to a 1.3 billion change in net proceeds from securities repurchase agreement obligations due to significant growth of the Company's trading portfolio during the six months ended September 30, 2023, which is mainly financed through the securities repurchase agreements. 
 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES 
 On May 10, 2023, our subsidiary Freedom EU signed a contract for the construction of Elysium Tower, a building in Limassol, Cyprus. The building is planned to be a new office building for our Freedom EU subsidiary. The contract implies approximate capital expenditures in the amount of 7.5 million, of which approximately 1.7 million was incurred in fiscal 2024 and of which approximately 2.8 million was incurred in the first six months of fiscal 2025. The remaining 3.4 million is planned to be incurred in during the 2025 calendar year. We are financing this construction project primarily using our own funds. 
 
 On November 27, 2023, our Board of Directors approved a strategic plan to expand our business by entering the telecommunications market in Kazakhstan through our Freedom Telecom subsidiary. Execution of the new plan is expected to require significant capital expenditure, the specific amount of which is currently uncertain. Total capital expenditures for the development of this business area are currently expected to be required for, among other things, construction of network infrastructure, including a backbone network, obtaining frequency licenses or other rights to provide services where required and acquisitions of smaller companies in the sector. Our strategy and budget for Freedom Telecom are currently being reassessed and are subject to revisions, which may be material. We currently plan to finance our capital expenditures for this business area with a combination of own funds and borrowings, including vendor financing and utilizing the proceeds of a 200 million U.S. dollar domestic bond placement on the AIX that we completed on December 19, 2023. For further information, see "Indebtedness Long-term" below. 
 
 As a further step in implementing our strategy to build a digital fintech ecosystem, on January 25, 2024, Freedom Telecom established a subsidiary, Freedom Media, in Kazakhstan for the purposes of providing media content to customers in Kazakhstan and Central Asia. Total capital expenditures required in connection with Freedom Media over the next five years are currently estimated to be approximately 54 million. We will finance our capital expenditures related to Freedom Media primarily using our own funds.

We currently intend to retain any future earnings to fund the operation, development and expansion of our business, and therefore we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. 
 We did not declare or pay a cash dividend on our common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 INDEBTEDNESS 
 Short-term 
 Our short-term financing is primarily obtained through securities repurchase arrangements conducted through stock exchanges. We use repurchase arrangements, among other things, to finance our liquidity positions. As of September 30, 2024, 2.6 billion, or 73 of the trading securities held in our proprietary trading account were subject to securities repurchase obligations compared to 2.8 billion, or 75 as of March 31, 2024. The securities we pledge as collateral under repurchase agreements are liquid trading securities with market quotes and significant trading volume. For additional information regarding our securities repurchase agreement obligations see Note 9 Securities Repurchase Agreement Obligations to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 
 Long-term 
 On October 21, 2021, our subsidiary Freedom SPC issued U.S. dollar-denominated bonds due 2026, in an aggregate principal amount up to 66 million, which are listed on the A IX . The annual interest rate for such bonds is 5.5 . The bonds are guaranteed by FRHC. As of September 30, 2024 , there was 64.7 million of such bonds outstanding. 
 In December 2023, Freedom SPC established a 1,000,000,000 bond program. Bonds, following issuance under the program, are listed on the AIX and guaranteed by FRHC. On December 19, 2023, Freedom SPC issued U.S. dollar-denominated bonds due 2028 under the program in an aggregate principal amount of 200 million. For the first and second years, the annual interest rate for such bonds is 12 , and for subsequent years the interest rate will be fixed and set as the sum of the effective federal funds rate as of December 10, 2025 and a margin of 6.5 . On September 16, 2024, Freedom SPC issued a series of 200 million bonds due 16 September 2026 under the program, with a 10.5 annual interest rate payable quarterly, of which 100 million bonds were placed on November 4, 2024. 
 The aggregate accrued interest as of September 30, 2024 on the Freedom SPC bonds due 2026 and the Freedom SPC bonds due 2028 combined was 2.3 million. 
 NET CAPITAL AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY 
 A number of our subsidiaries are required to satisfy minimum net capital and capital adequacy requirements to conduct their brokerage, banking and insurance operations in the jurisdictions in which they operate. This is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to FRHC. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. 
 At September 30, 2024, these minimum net capital and capital adequacy requirements ranged from appro ximately 0.2 million to 174.9 million and fluctuate depending on various factors. At September 30, 2024, the aggregate net capital and ca pital adequacy requirements of our subsidiaries was approximately 232.5 million. Each of our subsidiaries that are subject to net capital or capital adequacy requirements exceeded the minimum required amount at September 30, 2024. 
 Although we operate with levels of net capital and capital adequacy substantially greater than the minimum established thresholds, in the event we fail to maintain minimum net capital or capital adequacy, we may be subject to fines and penalties, suspension of operations, revocation of licensure and disqualification of our management from working in the industry. Our subsidiaries are also subject to various other rules and regulations, including liquidity and capital 
 88 

Table of Contents 

 adequacy ratios. Our operations that require the intensive use of capital are limited to the extent necessary to meet our regulatory requirements. 
 Over the past several years, we have pursued an aggressive growth strategy both through acquisitions and organic growth efforts. While our active growth strategy has led to revenue growth it also results in increased expenses and greater need for capital resources. Additional growth and expansion may require greater capital resources than we currently possess, which could require us to pursue additional equity or debt financing from outside sources. We cannot assure that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, at the time it is needed. 
 We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, cash expected to be generated from operating activities, and forecasted returns from our proprietary trading, combined with our ability to raise additional capital will be sufficient to meet our present and anticipated financing needs. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following are the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. 
 Allowance for credit losses 
 The Company has recently adopted a new accounting standard, ASC 326 - Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL), effective April 1, 2023. This standard has introduced significant changes to how we estimate and recognize credit losses for our financial assets. Management estimates and recognizes the CECL as an allowance for lifetime expected credit losses for loans issued. This is different compared to the previous practice of recognizing allowances based on probable incurred losses. 
 Under CECL, the allowance for credit losses (ACL) primarily consists of two components: 
 Collective CECL Component: This component is used for estimating expected credit losses for pools of loans that share common risk characteristics. 
 Individual CECL Component: This component is applied to loans that do not share common risk characteristics and require individual assessment. 
 The ACL is a valuation account that is subtracted from the amortized cost of total loans and available-for-sale securities to reflect the net amount expected to be collected. Our methodology for establishing the allowance for loan losses is based on a comprehensive assessment that considers relevant and available information from internal and external sources. This assessment takes into account past events, including historical trends in loan delinquencies and charge-offs, current economic conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. 
 Goodwill 
 We have accounted for our acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date as we allocate the purchase price to the estimated fair values of acquired tangible and intangible assets and the liabilities assumed. We also use our best estimates to determine the useful lives of the tangible and definite-lived intangible assets, which impact the periods over which depreciation and amortization of those assets are recognized. These best estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain as they pertain to forward looking views of our businesses, customer behavior, and market conditions. In our acquisitions, we have also recognized goodwill at the amount by which the purchase price paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired. 
 Our ongoing accounting for goodwill and the tangible and intangible assets acquired requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions as we exercise judgement to evaluate these assets for impairment. Our processes and accounting policies for evaluating impairments are further described in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q . As of September 30, 2024, we had goodwill of 53.2 million.

 Income taxes 
 We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgement is required in determining the provision for income tax. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax positions may be materially different than our determinations or estimates. 
 We recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets based on the difference between the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet and tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized. 
 Income taxes are determined in accordance with the laws of the relevant taxing authorities. As part of the process of preparing financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for tax consequences in future years based on differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements at each year-end and tax loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates applicable to the differences that are expected to affect taxable income. 
 We periodically evaluate and establish the likelihood of tax assessments based on current and prior years' examinations, and unrecognized tax benefits related to potential losses that may arise from tax audits in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. Once established, unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted when there is more information available or when an event occurs requiring a change. 
 Legal contingencies 
 We review outstanding legal matters at each reporting date, in order to assess the need for provisions and disclosures in our financial statements. Among the factors considered in making decisions on provisions are the nature of the matter, the legal process and potential legal exposure in the relevant jurisdiction, the progress of the matter (including the progress after the date of the financial statements but before those statements are issued), the opinions or views of our legal advisers, experiences on similar cases and any decision of our management as to how we will respond to the matter. 
 Non-consolidation of FST Belize 
 Based on our assessment, we do not consolidate our affiliate FST Belize. See " Non-Consolidation of Freedom Securities Trading Inc. " in Note 2 " Summary of Significant Accounting Policies " in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.

 Item 3. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Market Risk 
 The following information, together with information included in " Overview " in " Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations " in Part I Item 2, describes our primary market risk exposures. Market risk is the risk of economic loss arising from the adverse impact of market changes to the market value of our trading and investment positions. We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange risk and equity price risk. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and outstanding debt. While we are exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, we are most sensitive to fluctuations in Kazakhstan interest rates. Changes in Kazakhstan interest rates may have significant effect on the fair value of our securities.

Table of Contents 

 Our investment policies and strategies are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements. We typically invest in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. Our investment policies generally require securities to be investment grade and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer (other than government and quasi-government securities). To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel sh ift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 30, 2024, and March 31, 2024 (not including assets held for sale), a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would have resulted in 131.9 million and 128.9 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in inter est rates across all maturities would have resulted in a 141.6 million and 138.3 million incremental rise in the fair market value of the portfolio (not including assets held for sale), respectively. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 We have a presence in Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Lithuania, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Tajikistan, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States and Uzbekistan. The activities and accumulated earnings in our non-U.S. subsidiaries are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rate between our functional currencies and our reporting currency, which is the U.S. dollar. 
 In accordance with our risk management policies, we manage foreign currency exchange risk on financial assets by holding or creating financial liabilities in the same currency, maturity and interest rate profile. This foreign exchange risk is calculated on a net foreign exchange basis for individual currencies. We may also enter into foreign currency forward, swap and option contracts with financial institutions to mitigate foreign currency exposures associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, firmly committed transactions and forecasted future cash flows. 
 The main market of our operations is Kazakhstan. Because Kazakhstan's economy is highly dependent on oil exports, any significant decrease in oil prices lead to a devaluation of local currency, which can lose up to 17 quarterly (during COVID-19 outbreak) of its value relative to the U.S. dollar. 
 An analysis of our September 30, 2024, and March 31, 2024 (not including assets held for sale), balance sheets estimates the net impact of a 10 adverse change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to all other currencies, would have resulted in a decrease of income before income tax in the amount of 5.7 million and 121.5 million, respectively. 
 Equity Price Risk 
 Our equity investments are susceptible to market price risk arising from uncertainties about future values of such investment securities. Equity price risk results from fluctuations in price and level of the equity securities or instruments we hold. We also have equity investments in entities where the investment is denominated in a foreign currency, or where the investment is denominated in U.S. dollars but the investee primarily makes investments in foreign currencies. The fair values of these investments are subject to change at the spot foreign exchange rate between these currencies and our functional currency fluctuates. We attempt to manage the risk of loss inherent in our equity securities portfolio through diversification and by placing limits on individual and total equity instruments we hold. Reports on our equity portfolio are submitted to our management on a regular basis. 
 As of September 30, 2024, and March 31, 2024, our exposure to equity investments at fair value was 128.4 million and 126.1 million, respectively. Based on an analysis of the September 30, 2024, and March 31, 2024 (not including assets held for sale), balance sheets, we estimate that a decrease of 10 in the equity price would have reduced the value of the equity securities or instruments we held by approximately 12.8 million and 12.6 million, respectively. 
 Credit Risk 
 Credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising when a borrower or counterparty does not meet its financial obligations to us. We are primarily exposed to credit risk from institutions and individuals through the brokerage and banking services we offer. We incur credit risk in a number of areas, including margin lending and loans issued. 
 91 

Table of Contents 

 Margin lending receivables risk 
 We extend margin loans to our customers. Margin lending is subject to various regulatory requirements of MiFID and of the AFSA and the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Margin loans are collateralized by cash and securities in the customers' accounts. The risks associated with margin lending increase during periods of fast market movements, or in cases where collateral is concentrated and market movements occur. During such times, customers who utilize margin loans and who have collateralized their obligations with securities may find that the securities have a rapidly depreciating value and may not be sufficient to cover their obligations in the event of a liquidation. We are also exposed to credit risk when our customers execute transactions, such as short sales of options and equities that can expose them to risk beyond their invested capital. 
 We expect this kind of exposure to increase with the growth of our overall business. Because we indemnify and hold harmless our clearing houses and counterparties from certain liabilities or claims, the use of margin loans and short sales may expose us to significant off-balance-sheet risk in the event that collateral requirements are not sufficient to fully cover losses that customers may incur and those customers fail to satisfy their obligations. As of September 30, 2024, we had 1.6 billion in margin lending receivables from our customers, 680.1 million of which was attributable to a single counterparty. The amount of risk to which we are exposed from the margin lending we extend to our customers and from short sale transactions by our customers is unlimited and not quantifiable as the risk is dependent upon analysis of a potential significant and undeterminable rise or fall in stock prices. As a matter of practice, we enforce real-time margin compliance monitoring and liquidate customers' positions if their equity falls below required margin requirements. 
 We have a comprehensive policy implemented in accordance with regulatory standards to assess and monitor the suitability of investors to engage in various trading activities. To mitigate our risk, we also continuously monitor customer accounts to detect excessive concentration, large orders or positions, patterns of day trading and other activities that indicate increased risk to us. 
 Our credit exposure is to a great extent mitigated by our policy of automatically evaluating each account throughout the trading day and closing out positions automatically for accounts that are found to be under-margined. While this methodology is effective in most situations, it may not be effective in situations where no liquid market exists for the relevant securities or commodities or where, for any reason, automatic liquidation for certain accounts has been disabled. We continually monitor and evaluate our risk management policies, including the implementation of policies and procedures to enhance the detection and prevention of potential events to mitigate margin loan losses. 
 Risk related to banking loans recoverability 
 Our loan portfolio may be impacted by global, regional and local macroeconomic and market dynamics, including prolonged weakness in GDP, reductions in consumer spending, decreases in property values or market corrections, growing levels of consumer debt, rising or high unemployment rates, changes in foreign exchange or interest rates, widespread health crises or pandemics, severe weather conditions, and the effects of climate change. Economic or market stresses generally have negative effect on the business landscape and financial markets. Decreases in property values or market adjustments may increase the likelihood of borrowers or counterparties failing to meet their obligations to us, potentially leading to an increase in credit losses. 
 
 The main share of our customer loan portfolio is represented by digital mortgage loans issued within the framework of state support programs, funded from the funds of quasi state organizations. We participate in the government mortgage program in which the Kazakhstan government provides funding in the amount of approved mortgages and buys out the mortgages after disbursement with a recourse to the bank in case of default by a borrower. We mitigate our credit risk exposure in this case by our security interest in the financed real estate property. As such, significant rate of mortgage defaults in Kazakhstan could adversely affect our banking operations and the ultimate success of our digital mortgage product. 
 
 We reserve for potential credit losses in the future by recording a provision for credit losses through our earnings. This includes the allowance for credit losses based on management s estimates of current expected credit losses over the life of the respective credit exposures. These estimates are based on a review of past events, current conditions, and reasonable forecasts of future economic situations that might influence the recoverability of our loans. Our approach to determining these allowances involves both quantitative methods and a qualitative framework. Within this framework, management uses its judgment to evaluate internal and external risk factors. However, such judgments are inherently subject to the risk of misjudging these factors or misestimating their effects. We cannot guarantee that charge-offs related to our credit exposures will not happen in the future. Market and economic changes could lead to higher default and delinquency rates, adversely affecting our loan portfolio's quality and potentially resulting in higher charge-offs. While our 
 92

 estimates account for current conditions and anticipated changes during the portfolio's lifetime, actual outcomes could be worse than expected, significantly impacting our financial results, condition and cash flows. 
 
 For description of credit quality of the loans and other details please see "Note 7 - Loans Issued" in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Operational Risk 
 Operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss, or damage to our reputation, resulting from inadequate or failed operations or external events, including, but not limited to, business disruptions, improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions, deficiencies in our technology or financial operating systems and inadequacies or breaches in our control processes including cyber security incidents. 
 For a description of related risks, see the information under the heading " Risks Related to Information Technology and Cybersecurity " in " Risk Factors " in Part I Item 1A of the 2024 Form 10-K. 
 To mitigate and control operational risk, we have developed and continue to enhance policies and procedures that are designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels throughout the organization and within such departments. We also have business continuity plans in place that we believe will cover critical processes on a company-wide basis, and redundancies are built into our systems as we have deemed appropriate. These control mechanisms attempt to ensure that operational policies and procedures are being followed and that our various businesses are operating within established corporate policies and limits. 
 Legal and Compliance Risk 
 We operate in a number of jurisdictions, each with its own legal and regulatory structure that is unique and different from the other. Legal and regulatory risk includes the risk of non-compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and damage to our reputation as a result of failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, related self-regulatory organization standards and codes of conduct applicable to our business activities. Such non-compliance could result in the imposition of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, including fines, penalties, judgments, damages and/or settlements, or loss to reputation that we may suffer as a result of compliance failures. These risks include contractual and commercial risk, such as the risk that a counterparty's performance obligations will be unenforceable. It also includes compliance with AML, terrorist financing, anti-corruption and sanctions rules and regulations. 
 We have established and continue to enhance procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, such as public company reporting obligations, regulatory net capital and capital adequacy requirements, sales and trading practices, potential conflicts of interest, anti-money laundering, privacy, sanctions and recordkeeping. The legal and regulatory focus on the financial services industry presents a continuing business challenge for us. 
 Our business also subjects us to the complex income tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate, and these tax laws may be subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. We must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes. 
 Geopolitical Risk 
 The Russia-Ukraine conflict has led to disruptions in financial markets that has negatively impacted the global economy and created significant uncertainty. The Russia-Ukraine conflict has resulted in the imposition by many countries of economic sanctions and export controls against certain Russian industries, companies and individuals. In response, Russia has implemented its own countermeasures against countries, businesses and investors deemed "unfriendly." Partly as a result of the effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, businesses worldwide have experienced shortages in materials and increased costs for transportation, energy and raw materials. The continuation or escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict or other hostilities presents heightened risks relating to cyberattacks, supply chain disruptions, higher interest rates and greater frequency and volume of failures to settle securities transactions, as well as increase financial market volatility. The extent and duration of the war, sanctions and resulting market disruptions, as well as the potential adverse consequences for our business, liquidity and results of operations, are difficult to predict.

 Effects of Inflation 
 Because our assets are primarily short-term and liquid in nature, they are generally not significantly impacted by inflation. The rate of inflation does, however, affect our expenses, including employee compensation, communications and information processing and office leasing costs, which may not be readily recoverable from our customers. To the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has adverse impacts upon securities markets, it may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Our investment banking team focuses on multiple sectors including consumer and business services, energy, financial institutions, real estate, technology, media and communications. Our investment banking activities are concentrated in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan where commercial banks are currently focusing their financing activities on large enterprises or state-owned enterprises. In these countries, commercial lending sources also impose loan structures and debt covenants that preclude many companies from participating. This has created growing interest in and demand for our services. Our United States investment banking team has recently expanded its services to include

We acquired these companies from him at the historical cost paid by him plus amounts he has contributed as additional paid in capital since his purchase. These companies were not initially acquired directly by us because at the time they were put on the market for sale by their prior owner they did not have audit reports conforming to U.S. GAAP standards and had not demonstrated sustained profitability. We do not consider the acquisition of these insurance companies to be material in the context of our group as a whole. The purchase price for Freedom Finance Insurance JSC was U.S. 12.4 million and the purchase price for Freedom Finance Life JSC was U.S. 12.1 million.

 Regulatory oversight 
 
 We operate in highly regulated industries across several legal jurisdictions. The securities, banking, payment services and insurance business activities of our subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and oversight by the stock exchanges, central national banks, governmental and self-regulatory authorities in the foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business activities. We expect that the regulatory environment will continue to raise standards and impose new regulations with which we will be required to comply in a timely manner. 
 
 We operate under various securities, banking and insurance licenses and must maintain our licenses in order to conduct our operations. As of 31 March 2023, we, through our subsidiaries, held brokerage licenses in Kazakhstan issued by the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Regulation and Development of Financial Market (the ARDFM and the Astana Financial Services Authority (the AFSA ), in Cyprus issued by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission CySEC ), in the United States issued by FINRA, in Armenia issued by the Central Bank of Armenia, and in Uzbekistan issued by the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Uzbekistan a foreign 

currency operations license in Kazakhstan issued by the ARDFM a banking license in Kazakhstan issued by the ARDFM insurance licenses (general and life) in Kazakhstan issued by the ARDFM and payment services licenses in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. 
 
 We spend considerable resources in our general efforts to comply with the various regulations to which we are subject, and we expect this burden to continue in the future. 
 
 Competition 
 
 We face intense competition in each of the markets where we offer our services. We compete with international, regional and local brokerage, banking, and financial services firms that offer an array of financial products and services. The brokerage and financial service firms which we currently regard as our principal competitors include Halyk Finance, BCC Invest and First Heartland Securities in Kazakhstan and eToro and Interactive Brokers in Europe. We consider Bank Freedom Finance Kazakhstan JSC s principal banking competitors to be Halyk Bank, Kaspi Bank and Bank CenterCredit. In the United States, we expect to compete with, among others, Needham & Company, Craig-Hallum Capital Group and Oppenheimer & Co. 
 
 Many of the firms with which we compete are larger, provide additional and more diversified services and products, provide access to more international markets, and have greater technical, and financial resources. We leverage competitive advantages we have developed, including our extensive experience in providing investors in our core markets with access to the U.S. and European securities markets, our ability to deliver high quality analytical information and our focus on providing convenient, high tech user-friendly access to our services and the markets. We have also been an active participant in various privatization programs, which has allowed us to develop expertise and a prominent reputation in the public placement of securities of local issuers in the regions where we operate. 
 
 2.2. Risk factors 
 
 The Issuer is a newly organized subsidiary of FRHC. The main activity of the FFSPC is raising funds through issuing and placing bonds for the sole purpose of financing loans in favor of the parent company FRHC. The risks and uncertainties described in the risk factors below relate to the activities of the FRHC. 
 
 Risks Related to the Russia-Ukraine Conflict 
 
 Our business and operations may be materially adversely affected by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. 
 
 We have historically had significant operations in Russia. In view of the critical challenges for our business and operations resulting from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the responses of governments and multinational businesses to it, shortly after the onset of the Russia-Ukraine conflict we decided to divest our two Russian subsidiaries. On 19 October 2022, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to divest our Russian subsidiaries, and the divestiture of these subsidiaries was approved by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation on 10 February 2023, and was completed on 27 February 2023. Notwithstanding that we have completed the divestiture of our Russian subsidiaries, there can be no assurance that such divestiture will achieve its intended effects. In particular, we expect that the divestiture of our Russian subsidiaries will reduce our exposure to the current challenging geopolitical circumstances and will enable us to accelerate growth in other markets. However, these matters are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. A failure by us to achieve the intended effects of the divestiture of our Russian subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods. In addition, we continue to provide brokerage services to Russian persons, including a number of former clients of our Russian subsidiaries, through their accounts at non-Russian companies within our group and indirectly through accounts held with our affiliate FST Belize. As a result, we continue to have significant exposure to Russia, which poses continuing challenges for our business and operations. These challenges, including the specific risks outlined below, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. 
 
 Our business may be materially adversely impacted by negative macroeconomic and geopolitical developments in Russia and in other countries in which we operate or in which our clients are located. 
 
 Historically, a large portion of our brokerage business has been attributable to securities trading by individuals and qualifying institutions in Russia, through accounts held at our Russian subsidiaries, through accounts held at our 

non-Russian subsidiaries and indirectly through accounts held with FST Belize. Although we have divested our Russian subsidiaries, we continue to generate a significant amount of fee and commission income from trading activity engaged in by Russian persons (including former clients of our former Russian subsidiaries) who are not subject to any sanctions or other legal restrictions through their accounts at our non-Russian subsidiaries, including indirectly through their accounts at FST Belize. 
 
 The Russia-Ukraine conflict and responses to it have materially and adversely impacted the macroeconomic climate in Russia and the surrounding region, resulting in significant currency rate volatility, the imposition of currency controls, capital flight, materially increased interest rates and inflation, and the withdrawal of or reduction of business by a number of Western businesses from the Russian market, any of which may lead to reduced investment confidence and investment spending by affected Russian persons. Should there be a large scale expansion of Russia-related sanctions to make them applicable to private sector financial institutions in Russia or to Russia s banking system generally, this could negatively affect the Russian economy and investment climate and cause deterioration of the Russian financial markets. In addition, there is a risk that new international sanctions and new countersanctions measures may curtail the ability of our Russian brokerage customers to trade through non-Russian accounts or in non-Russian securities, or our ability to facilitate any trading through our non-Russian subsidiaries or FST Belize. For example, given Kazakhstan s extensive historical business ties with Russia, we are exposed to the risk that secondary sanctions could be imposed on the financial sector in Kazakhstan. If investment spending by Russian persons through non-Russian trading accounts declines for any reason, this could result in a material reduction in our revenues. 
 
 The Russia-Ukraine conflict has also had, and may continue to have, adverse effects on our results of operations related to proprietary trading. For example, during year ended 31 March 2023 we sold 7,500,000 shares in the SPB Exchange that we owned and realized a loss from such sale in the amount of U.S. 73.4 million. We attribute this loss to a combination of factors, including heightened market uncertainty and increased volatility caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict and its geopolitical consequences. Although neither FRHC nor any of its group companies is the subject of any sanctions imposed by the United States, the European Union or the United Kingdom, and we have divested our Russian subsidiaries, sanctions related to Russia could adversely impact our business. For example, we continue to provide brokerage services to a significant number of Russian persons through their non-Russian accounts with us or indirectly through accounts held with FST Belize, and sanctions could restrict our ability to continue to provide brokerage services to such Russian persons. Sanctions could also limit our ability to, or make it difficult for us to, enter into agreements with counterparties, who may refuse to work with us due to our significant Russian customer base. 
 
 Should there be an expansion of Russia-related sanctions, this could significantly increase the foregoing risks to our business. The impact of any such expansion would depend on the nature of such sanctions. Examples of additional sanctions measures that could affect our business include 
 
 expanding the scope of sanctioned activities or transactions 
 designating parties with whom we have or may have significant business relationships as specially designated nationals or blocked parties, meaning that all dealings with them by the U.S., EU and or UK persons, or persons from other countries which impose economic sanctions, or involving items or technologies from these jurisdictions would be prohibited 
 expanding sanctions to cover entities that are less than 50 owned or controlled by a sanctioned party or 
 adopting corporate policies that prohibit or restrict business activities with us because we conduct business with Russian persons who are not subject to any sanctions. 
 
 Sanctions imposed on our founder and our Ukrainian subsidiary by Ukraine could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 
 On 19 October 2022, Timur Turlov, our Ukrainian subsidiary and our two Russian subsidiaries (which Russian subsidiaries have since been divested) were included on the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine sanctions list, which included more than 2,500 companies and individuals. In connection with these sanctions, the operations of our Ukrainian subsidiary were suspended. We believe that the inclusion of Mr. Turlov and these subsidiaries on the list was due to perceived connections with Russia. While we believe the inclusion of Mr. Turlov and our Ukrainian subsidiary on the list is not justified and we have been actively appealing the decision, there can be no assurance as to when they will be removed from the list, if at all. While our Ukrainian subsidiary is not material in the context of our overall group, the inclusion of Mr. Turlov and our Ukrainian subsidiary on this list 

could materially adversely affect our relationships with counterparties and regulators in other jurisdictions and as a result could restrict our ability to conduct our business and carry out our business strategy. In addition, because we have a significant number of Ukrainian brokerage customers that are served by our non-Ukrainian subsidiaries, the existing sanctions imposed by Ukraine, or any expansion of such sanctions could adversely affect our brokerage business. 
 
 Non-compliance with U.S., EU, UK, Russian or other sanctions programs could adversely impact our company. 
 
 We are committed to compliance with all applicable economic sanctions, including those related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. U.S. economic sanctions include prohibitions primary sanctions) that are generally administered and enforced by OFAC. With the exception of OFAC s Iran and Cuba sanctions programs these prohibitions apply to U.S. persons, including companies organized under the laws of the United States and their overseas branches, but do not apply to non-U.S. subsidiaries of U.S. persons. U.S. economic sanctions also include secondary sanctions that make certain activities of non-U.S. companies sanctionable under U.S. statutes such as the Countering America s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). These sanctions are administered by OFAC and or the U.S. Department of State. We require all of our group companies to fully comply with all U.S. primary sanctions that are applicable to them and or to transactions in which they are involved and to refrain from participation in any conduct that is sanctionable under U.S. secondary sanctions. 
 
 Because FRHC is a U.S.-domiciled holding company that operates through its subsidiaries, we are obliged to comply with Ukraine-Russia conflict-related sanctions imposed by the United States, but those sanctions do not apply to the fully independent activities of our non-U.S. subsidiaries where there is no U.S. nexus. If, however, it was determined that FRHC facilitated activities of its subsidiaries that are prohibited under U.S. sanctions, FRHC could be subject to civil or criminal penalties under OFAC regulations. In addition, non-U.S. companies that cause U.S. companies to violate OFAC regulations may be subject to enforcement action and thereby the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. This could occur, for example, if one of our non-U.S. subsidiaries were to process a U.S. dollar transaction involving sanctioned securities through the U.S. financial system. The risk of noncompliance may arise in connection with international transactions conducted in U.S. dollars, transfers to or from U.S. bank accounts, or dealings with U.S. broker-dealers. 
 
 We maintain omnibus brokerage accounts for several institutional clients, including FST Belize and certain Russian institutions. The order flow from these accounts represents transactions of customers of the relevant institutions, which are executed by the relevant institutions through their omnibus accounts with us. While we have agreements with such customers in which they have agreed to comply with sanctions laws, and to grant us access to its customer records for purposes of compliance monitoring upon our request, we do not have direct access to such institutional customers own customer check systems and as a result we cannot provide assurance that the beneficial owners who are the beneficiaries of trades being carried out through such omnibus accounts are not sanctioned persons. 
 
 In the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees, agents or independent contractors have or may have caused us or any of our subsidiaries to violate applicable economic sanctions laws, we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, which could be costly and require significant time and attention from senior management. Non-compliance with these laws may result in criminal or civil penalties, which could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and cause significant brand or reputational damage. 
 
 Sanctions are subject to rapid change, and it is also possible that new direct or indirect secondary sanctions could be imposed by the U.S. or other jurisdictions without warning in relation to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The extent of current sanctions measures, not all of which are fully aligned across jurisdictions, further increases operational complexity for our business and increases the risk of making errors in managing day-to-day business activities within the rapidly evolving sanctions environment. In addition, certain transactions that may be prohibited by economic sanctions regulations of OFAC if undertaken by us or in the United States may be permissible if undertaken independently by a non-U.S. subsidiary where there is no U.S. nexus. 
 
 We are monitoring closely the developing sanctions environment, including Russian countersanctions, and utilizing dedicated corporate governance structures and in-house and outside advisors as and when required to ensure our continued compliance. However, we cannot assure that we can remain in compliance with all sanctions and countersanctions. 

During year ended 31 March 2023 our subsidiaries Bank Freedom Finance Kazakhstan JSC and Freedom Finance Global PLC provided brokerage services to certain individuals and entities who are subject to sanctions imposed by OFAC, the European Union or the United Kingdom. These transactions did not involve any nexus with the United States, the European Union or the United Kingdom, as applicable. As of 31 March 2023, our customer liabilities relating to these individuals and entities in aggregate were U.S. 17.8 million, representing approximately 0.92 of our total customer liabilities as of such date. 
 
 For year ended 31 March 2023, the aggregate fee and commission income relating to transactions with these individuals and entities in aggregate was approximately U.S. 34,000, representing approximately 0.01 of our total fee and commission income for such fiscal year. 
 
 Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters 
 
 We are subject to extensive regulation, and the failure to comply with laws and regulations could subject us to monetary penalties or sanctions. 
 
 Our business is subject to extensive government regulation, licensing and oversight in multiple jurisdictions. Laws, regulations and rules or other obligations to which we are subject include but are not limited to those concerning securities brokerage, commercial banking, insurance services, payment services, securities trading, investment banking, granting of credit, deposit taking, margin lending, foreign currency exchange, data protection and privacy, cross-border and domestic money transmission, cyber security, fraud detection, antitrust and competition, consumer protection, U.S. and non-U.S. sanctions regimes, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing. Our Freedom Capital Markets subsidiary is a broker-dealer and investment adviser registered with the SEC and is primarily regulated by FINRA. 
 
 As we introduce new products and services and expand existing product and service offerings, we may become subject to additional regulations, restrictions, licensing requirements and related regulatory oversight. 
 
 Compliance with many of the regulations applicable to us involves a number of risks, particularly in areas where applicable regulations may be subject to varying interpretation. Many of the requirements imposed by these regulations are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect customers and other third parties who deal with us. New regulations may result in enhanced standards of duty on broker-dealers in their dealings with their clients. Consequently, these regulations often serve to limit our activities, including through net capital, customer protection and market conduct requirements, including those relating to principal trading. 
 
 We have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Notwithstanding these measures, it is possible that our employees, contractors, and agents could nevertheless breach such laws and regulations. We may be subject to legal claims from our customers and counterparties, as well as regulatory actions brought against us by the regulators, self-regulatory agencies and supervisory authorities that oversee and regulate the industries in which we operate. 
 
 From time to time, we have been, and in the future may be, subject to investigations, audits, inspections and subpoenas, as well as regulatory proceedings and fines and penalties brought by regulators. We are subject to regulation from numerous regulators, which include, but are not limited to, the AFSA, the ARDFM, CySEC and the SEC. We have received various inquiries and formal requests for information on various matters from certain regulators, with which we have cooperated and will continue to do so. If we are found to have violated any applicable laws, rules or regulations, formal administrative or judicial proceedings may be initiated against us that may result in censure, fine, civil or criminal penalties. For example, on November 25, 2022, our subsidiary Freedom Finance Global PLC, incorporated in the AIFC, entered into a settlement agreement with the AFSA which was the result of an on-site inspection by the AFSA of Freedom Finance Global PLC conducted between October and December 2021. Following such inspection, the AFSA communicated to Freedom Finance Global PLC a number of substantial findings and regulatory concerns related to matters of prudential, conduct-of-business, anti-money laundering and combatting financing of terrorism. In connection with the settlement agreement, Freedom Finance Global PLC was required to pay monetary penalties and carry out a remediation plan. In addition, on February 13, 2023, following an elective audit of Bank Freedom Finance Kazakhstan JSC commenced by the ARDFM in June 2022, the ARDFM issued an order providing that Bank Freedom Finance Kazakhstan JSC violated a number of banking laws and regulations. In connection with such order, Bank Freedom Finance Kazakhstan JSC was required to carry out a remediation plan. We could also experience negative publicity and reputational damage as a result of 

future lawsuits, claims or regulatory actions. Any of the foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate, adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 
 Financial services firms have been subject to increased regulatory scrutiny, increasing the risk of financial liability and reputational harm resulting from adverse regulatory actions. 
 
 Firms in the financial services industry have been operating in an onerous regulatory environment. The industry has experienced increased scrutiny from a variety of regulators, including the SEC and FINRA in the United States, U.S. state regulators and regulators in non-U.S. jurisdictions. Penalties and fines sought by regulatory authorities have increased substantially. We may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities. Each of the regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over us has regulatory powers dealing with many different aspects of financial services, including, but not limited to, the authority to fine us and to grant, cancel, restrict or otherwise impose conditions on the right to continue operating particular businesses. Increasingly, regulators have instituted a practice of regulation by enforcement where new interpretations of existing regulations are introduced by bringing enforcement actions against securities firms for activities that occurred in the past but were not then thought to be problematic. We also may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the SEC, other U.S. or non-U.S. governmental regulatory authorities or self-regulatory organizations (e.g., FINRA) that supervise the financial markets. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action taken against us could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, including our cash position. 
 
 As a U.S. public company listed on Nasdaq, we have substantial regulatory reporting obligations. 
 
 We are subject to extensive corporate governance, reporting and accounting disclosure requirements under U.S. securities laws and regulations of the SEC. These laws, as well as the listing standards of Nasdaq, impose certain compliance requirements, costs and obligations on listed companies. This requires a significant commitment of resources and management oversight. The expenses associated with being a public company include auditing, accounting and legal fees and expenses, investor relations expenses, increased directors fees, registrar and transfer agent fees and listing fees, as well as other expenses. 
 
 Failure to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory, exchange or market authorities, and related penalties, fines and litigation. 
 
 We are subject to risks related to anti-corruption laws in effect in the United States and the non-U.S. jurisdictions where we conduct business. 
 
 We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA and similar non-U.S. anti-corruption laws that generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining an unfair advantage. 
 
 Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws, with more frequent voluntary self-disclosures by companies, aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings, resulting in record fines and penalties, increased enforcement activity, and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals. 
 
 We operate through subsidiaries in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Cyprus, Germany, the United Kingdom, United States, Greece, Spain, France, Poland, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey and United Arab Emirates. Enforcement officials generally interpret anti-corruption laws to prohibit, among other things, improper payments to government officials such as those of the ARDFM, CySEC, FINRA, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority of Germany BaFIN ), the Center for Coordination and Development of Securities Market of the Republic of Uzbekistan, which are the principal regulatory bodies that control and monitor our operations in the respective countries in which we operate. Our internal policies and those of our subsidiaries provide for training and compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws and regulations. Despite our training and compliance programs, it is possible that our employees, agents or independent contractors may cause us or a subsidiary to violate applicable laws. In the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees, agents or independent contractors have or may have caused us or a subsidiary to violate applicable anti-corruption laws, we may be required to investigate or have 

outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, which can be costly and require significant time and attention from senior management. Non-compliance with these laws may result in criminal or civil penalties, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, result of operations and cash flows. 
 
 A failure by our subsidiaries to meet capital adequacy and liquidity requirements could affect our operations and financial condition. 
 
 As a condition to maintaining our licenses to conduct brokerage and banking activities, some of our subsidiaries must meet ongoing capital and liquidity standards, which are subject to evolving rules and qualitative judgments by government regulators regarding the adequacy of their capital and internal assessment of their capital needs. These net capital rules may limit the ability of each subsidiary to transfer capital to us. New regulatory capital, liquidity, and stress testing requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how each subsidiary utilizes its capital and may require us to increase our capital and or liquidity or to limit our growth. Failure by our subsidiaries to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could adversely affect the licenses of our subsidiaries, as well as our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 
 The countries in which we operate have changing regulatory regimes, regulatory policies, and interpretations. 
 
 The countries in which we operate have differing, and sometimes conflicting, regulatory regimes governing the delivery of financial services in each country, the transfer of funds to and from such countries, and other aspects of the broker-dealer, finance, investment, banking, and insurance industries. In some jurisdictions where we operate, these provisions were promulgated during changing political circumstances, are continuing to change and may be relatively untested, particularly insofar as they apply to foreign investments by residents of various countries. 
 
 Therefore, there may exist little or no administrative or enforcement history or established practice that can aid us in evaluating how the regulatory regimes may impact our operations or our customers. It is possible that governmental policies will change or that new laws and regulations, administrative practices or policies, or interpretations of existing laws and regulations including those governing capital, liquidity, leverage, long-term debt, margin requirements, restrictions on leveraged lending or other business practices, reporting requirements and tax burdens will materially and adversely affect our activities in one or more of the countries where we operate. Further, since the history and practice of industry regulation is limited in a number of jurisdictions where we operate, our activities may be particularly vulnerable to the decisions and positions of individuals, who may change, be subject to external pressures, or administer policies inconsistently. Internal bureaucratic politics may have unpredictable and negative consequences. If we fail to develop and maintain good working relationships with local regulators, or a local regulator determines that we have violated local laws in a particular market it could negatively impact our businesses in that market and our reputation generally. 
 
 Our revenue and profitability could be affected by changes to rules and regulations that impact the business and financial sectors generally, including changes to the laws governing foreign ownership, electronic commerce, customer privacy and security of customer data. In addition, changes to laws, rules and regulations or changes in the enforcement of existing laws, rules or regulations, could 
 
 limit the lines of business we conduct 
 require us to reduce our ownership stake in a subsidiary 
 compel us to terminate certain lines of business in affected jurisdictions 
 require us to reduce our investment position in a particular instrument 
 result in material cost increases including our cost of capital 
 otherwise adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with other institutions that are not similarly impacted 
 require us to modify existing business practices 
 force us to relocate operations or personnel 
 require us to invest significant management attention and resources and legal costs to evaluate and make necessary changes to our compliance, risk management, treasury and operations functions 
 make it uneconomical for us to provide certain services in particular countries and 
 influence how we manage our capital and liquidity. 
 
 Our measures to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing violations may not be completely effective. 

Notwithstanding the anti-money-laundering AML regulations that are in place in Kazakhstan, the EU, the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate, we are subject to the risk that our subsidiaries that are financial institutions could be used as vehicles for money laundering. 
 
 Minimum standards and duties according to the anti-money laundering legislation in Kazakhstan, Cyprus, the EU, the U.S. and other jurisdictions where we operate include customer identification, analysis of the customer s economic profile, record keeping, suspicious activity reporting, employee training, an audit function and designation of a compliance officer. Suspicious transactions must be reported on a daily basis to the relevant authorities. We comply with applicable anti-money-laundering and anti-terrorist financing laws and regulations. Our anti-money-laundering measures are based on relevant legislation. For example, Kazakhstan is a member of the Eurasian Group (an Associate Member of the FATF) and has enacted laws and regulations to combat money laundering, terrorist financing and other financial crimes. We have procedures and documents aimed at preventing money laundering and financing of terrorist activities, including a general anti-money-laundering policy, employee training, the designation of a compliance officer, internal control procedures that include a refusal policy whereby we may refuse to conduct business with suspicious entities or individuals and rules on counteracting money laundering and financing of individuals and legal entities engaged in terrorist activities. In the case of suspicious transactions, internal suspicion reports (ISRs) are submitted to the local compliance departments for initial internal investigation. In the case of confirmed suspicious transactions, such transactions are reported immediately to the relevant local financial intelligence unit (FIU). 
 
 Due to our omnibus brokerage arrangement with FST Belize, penalties and other enforcement actions could be brought against us under relevant AML CTF laws due to breaches by FST Belize of those laws and regulation and similar laws despite the fact that we have indirect control over the activities and policies of FST Belize. Our subsidiary Freedom Finance Europe Limited has a Cross Border Correspondent Relationship Agreement with FST Belize wherein FST Belize has agreed to comply with AML CTF controls that are applicable to brokers in the U.S. and EU, and to grant us access to its customer records for purposes of compliance monitoring upon our request. We do not have direct access to FST Belize s customer check systems. In accordance with the Cross-Border Correspondent Relationship Agreement, Freedom Finance Europe Limited conducts random checks on a regular basis of trades received from FST Belize whereby it is able to obtain information on, and conduct customer checks on, the beneficial owners who are the beneficiaries of the relevant trades. FST Belize utilizes a third party provider platform to onboard and confirm liveness, face match and AML sanctions screening on an ongoing basis. 
 
 In addition, we maintain omnibus brokerage accounts for certain other institutional brokerage clients, including certain Russian institutions. The order flow from these accounts represents transactions of underlying customers of the relevant institutions, which are executed by the relevant institutions through their omnibus accounts with us. While we have agreements with such institutional clients in which they have agreed to comply with AML CTF controls that are applicable to brokers in the U.S. and EU, and we tested their frameworks and systems by regular risk-based sampling and have access to their underlying customer records for purposes of compliance monitoring, we do not have direct access to such institutional clients underlying customers or screening systems and as a result we cannot provide assurance that the beneficial owners who are the beneficiaries of trades being carried out through such omnibus accounts are conducting trades in compliance with applicable AML CTF laws. 
 
 We believe that we fully comply with the reporting requirements under applicable legislation related to money laundering or terrorist financing. However, there can be no assurance that third parties will not attempt to use us as a conduit for money laundering or terrorist financing without our knowledge, nor that the measures described above will be completely effective. Any technical or other breaches of the anti-money laundering laws and regulations by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 
 If we violate securities laws or are involved in litigation in connection with a violation, our reputation and results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 
 Many aspects of our business involve substantial risks of liability. In our underwriting business, we are exposed to substantial liability under U.S. federal, state and non-U.S. securities laws, other U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. laws, and court decisions, including decisions with respect to underwriters liability and limitations on indemnification of underwriters by issuers. For example, a firm that acts as an underwriter may be held liable for material misstatements or omissions of fact in a prospectus used in connection with the securities being offered or for statements made by its securities analysts or other personnel. Our underwriting activities will usually involve 

offerings of the securities of smaller companies, which often involve a higher degree of risk and are more volatile than the securities of more established companies. In comparison with more established companies, smaller companies are also more likely to be the subject of securities class actions, to carry directors and officers liability insurance policies with lower limits or not at all, and to become insolvent. In addition, in market downturns, claims tend to increase. Each of these factors increases the likelihood that an underwriter may be required to contribute to an adverse judgment or settlement of a securities lawsuit. 
 
 We are subject to risks related to potential litigation. 
 
 We may be subject to legal claims from our customers and counterparties, employment-related claims and other claims. We could experience negative publicity and reputational damage as a result of lawsuits or claims, in addition to potentially significant costs incurred to defend ourselves or settle claims and judgments. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. 
 
 Risk Related to our Business and Operations 
 
 Our relatively limited operational history has coincided with sustained market growth which may not be predictive of future operating results. 
 
 Our legacy brokerage operations were merged into our holding company, which is a Nevada-incorporated company, in several stages between November 2015 and 2017, and we have grown rapidly over the last several years. For example, our total revenue, net (after presenting our Russian subsidiaries as discontinued operations) was U.S. 114.5 million for fiscal year ended 31 March 2020, U.S. 346.9 million for the fiscal year ended 31 March 2021, U.S. 689.8 million for the fiscal year ended 31 March 2022 and U.S. 795.7 million for the fiscal year ended 31 March 2023. Although this growth has been sustained over several years, our operational life has been relatively limited compared to longer term market and macroeconomic cycles. Our operating history has coincided with a period of general growth in the U.S. equity markets, as well as growth in the financial services and technology industries in which we operate. We therefore have not experienced any prolonged downturn or slowdown in macroeconomic or industry growth or any significant downturn in U.S. equity markets and cannot assure that we will be able to respond effectively to any such downturn or slowdown in the future. As such, our recent growth should not be considered indicative of our future performance. Further, as a result of the limited operating history of the Company in its current form, and our rapid growth during sustained favorable market and economic conditions, we have limited financial data that can be used to evaluate our future prospects, which subjects us to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to plan for, model and manage future growth and risks. 
 
 We may not be able to manage our growth effectively. 
 
 We have experienced recent rapid growth in our business over a short period. Our number of total brokerage customer accounts increased from approximately 170,000 as of 31 March 2021 to approximately 370,000 as of 31 March 2023. Our total number of employees increased from 2,546 employees as of 31 March 2021 to 3,689 employees as of 31 March 2023. Our total assets increased by 119 to U.S. 5.1 billion as of 31 March 2023 from U.S. 2.3 billion as of 31 March 2021. In addition, we have made a number of recent significant acquisitions, including the acquisitions of Bank Freedom Finance Kazakhstan JSC and Freedom Capital Markets in December 2020, and Freedom Finance Life JSC and Freedom Finance Insurance JSC in May 2022. We also expect to make other significant acquisitions in the future. 
 
 There is no guarantee that we will be able to achieve a positive return on the investment we make in the general expansion of our business. Moreover, our overall growth has required and will continue to require significant allocation of capital and management resources, further development of our financial, internal controls and information technology systems, continued upgrading and streamlining of our risk management systems and additional training and recruitment of management and other key personnel. At the same time, we must maintain a consistent level of client services and current operations to avoid loss of business or damage to our reputation. If we fail to adequately manage growth, such failure may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 
 We anticipate that acquisitions will continue to play a key role in our growth strategy, but we may be unable to identify, acquire, complete or integrate acquisition targets successfully. 

Acquisitions have been, and continue to be, a significant component of our growth strategy. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to grow our business through acquisitions as we have done historically, that businesses acquired will perform in accordance with our expectations or that business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove to be correct. 
 
 We will continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position, expand our customer base or enhance our existing service offerings. There is no assurance that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future, nor is there assurance that completed acquisitions will be successful. 
 
 In addition, there are substantial risks associated with acquisitions and expansion into new business areas, including risks that (i) our unfamiliarity with new lines of business may adversely affect the success of such acquisitions, (ii) revenue from such activities might not be sufficient to offset the development, regulatory and other implementation costs, (iii) competing products and services and shifting market preferences might affect the profitability of such activities, and (iv) our internal controls might be inadequate to manage the risks associated with new activities. There is also substantial cost and time expended to complete post-closing integration of acquisitions, including human resource training, data and technology systems and operational processes. We may also incur potential dilution of our brand, assumption of known and unknown liabilities, indemnities and potential disputes with the sellers. Any such difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, we cannot provide any assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits and or synergies of any such acquisition or investment. 
 
 We rely on our relationship with FST Belize for a significant percentage of our revenue, which exposes us to several risks. 
 
 Timur Turlov established FST Belize in July 2014. FST Belize was established to provide investors in Russia and Kazakhstan with easier access to the U.S. securities markets than a Russian or Kazakhstan company could provide, due to applicable regulations in Russia and Kazakhstan at the time, which imposed restrictions on foreign currency accounts, required mandatory securities custody in-country, and limited access to foreign securities, unless listed on local exchanges. When our legacy brokerage operations were merged into the Company beginning in November 2015, FST Belize remained outside of the Company s group. We have conducted, and continue to conduct, a significant amount of business with FST Belize through its omnibus accounts with our Freedom Finance Europe Limited subsidiary and though omnibus accounts that Freedom Finance Europe Limited holds with FST Belize. In year ended 31 March 2023, approximately 61 of our fee and commission income was derived from transactions with FST Belize. The majority of the order flow from FST Belize to Freedom Finance Europe Limited represents transactions of customers of FST Belize, which are executed by FST Belize through its omnibus accounts with Freedom Finance Europe Limited. 
 
 The significant amount of business we conduct with FST Belize subjects us to certain risks. In particular, related party transactions are generally regarded as increasing the risk of misstatements or omissions in financial reporting, the risk of transactions being done on other than arm s length terms due to the close ties between the parties involved and the risk of regulatory non-compliance. In particular, this arrangement subjects us to the risk of penalties and other enforcement actions under relevant AML CTF laws that could result from breaches by FST Belize of those laws and regulations, economic sanctions and similar laws despite the fact that we have no direct control over the activities or policies of FST Belize. We estimate that, as of 31 March 2023, approximately 40 of the brokerage customers of FST Belize were Russian persons. In addition, the large extent of our related party transactions with FST Belize could have an adverse effect on our relationships with applicable regulators. 
 
 While we intend to reduce the amount of transactions conducted under our omnibus brokerage arrangement with FST Belize over time and to ultimately eliminate such arrangement, and our fee and commission income from transactions with FST Belize has decreased in each of the past four financial quarters including the quarter ended 31 March 2023, there can be no assurance as to the extent or timing of our reducing or eliminating such transactions going forward. A failure by us to reduce the level of our related party transactions with FST Belize could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and cash flows. 
 
 Competition in the markets in which we operate may result in a decrease in our market share and or profitability. 

We face intense competition in each of the markets where we offer our services. We compete with international, regional and local brokerage, banking, and financial services firms that offer an array of financial products and services. Many of the firms with which we compete are larger, provide additional and more diversified services and products, provide access to more international markets, and have greater technical and financial resources. If we fail to compete effectively with other retail brokerage and financial services firms, or potential new entrants to the market, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 
 We could suffer significant losses from credit exposure. 
 
 We are exposed to credit risk, primarily from institutions and individuals through the brokerage services we offer. We incur credit risk in a number of areas, including margin lending. We extend margin loans to our customers. As of 31 March 2023, we had margin lending receivables in the amount of U.S. 376.3 million. When we purchase securities on margin, enter into securities repurchase agreements or trade options or futures, we are subject to the risk that we, or our customers, may default on those obligations when the value of the securities and cash in our own proprietary or in the customers accounts falls below the amount of the indebtedness. Abrupt changes in securities valuations and the failure to meet margin calls could result in substantial financial losses. Margin loans are collateralized by cash and securities in the customers accounts. The risks associated with margin credit increase during periods of fast market movements, or in cases where collateral is concentrated, and market movements occur. During such times, customers who utilize margin loans and who have collateralized their obligations with securities may find that the securities have a rapidly depreciating value and may not be sufficient to cover their obligations in the event of a liquidation. We are also exposed to credit risk when our customers execute transactions, such as short sales of options and equities that can expose them to risk beyond their invested capital. Because we indemnify and hold harmless our clearing houses and counterparties from certain liabilities or claims, the use of margin loans and short sales may expose us to significant off-balance-sheet risk in the event that collateral requirements are not sufficient to fully cover losses that customers may incur and those customers fail to satisfy their obligations. The amount of risk to which we are exposed from the margin lending we extend to our customers and from short sale transactions by our customers is potentially unlimited and not quantifiable as the risk is dependent upon analysis of a potential significant and undeterminable rise or fall in stock prices. As a matter of practice, we enforce real-time margin compliance monitoring and liquidate customers positions if their equity falls below established margin requirements. 
 
 In addition, we have exposure to credit risk from our digital mortgage program in Kazakhstan. Although we take part in a government mortgage program whereby the Kazakhstan government funds the amount of approved mortgages, we service the mortgages and remain liable for mortgage in the event of default, but we are protected by our security interest in the real property. As such, significant mortgage defaults in Kazakhstan could adversely affect our banking operations and the ultimate success of our digital mortgage product. 
 
 We also have exposure to credit risk associated with our proprietary investments. We rely on the use of credit arrangements as a significant component of our trading strategy. Our investments are subject to price fluctuations as a result of changes in the financial markets assessment of credit quality. Loss in securities value can negatively affect our financial performance and earnings if our management determines that such securities are other-than-temporarily-impaired OTTI ). The evaluation of whether OTTI exists is a matter of judgment, which includes the assessment of several factors. If our management determines that a security is OTTI, the cost basis of the security may be adjusted, and a corresponding loss may be recognized in current earnings. Deterioration in the value of securities held in our proprietary portfolio could result in the recognition of future impairment charges. Even if a security is not considered OTTI, if we were forced to sell the security sooner than intended, we may have to recognize an unrealized loss at that time. 
 
 While we have policies and procedures designed to manage credit risk, the policies and procedures may not be fully effective to protect us against the risk of loss. 
 
 Our ability to meet our obligations, and the cost of funds to do so, depend on our ability to access identified sources of liquidity at a reasonable cost. 
 
 Liquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet our obligations, including financial commitments, as they come due. This risk is inherent in our operations and can be heightened by a number of factors, including an over-reliance on a particular source of funding, changes in credit ratings or market-wide phenomena such as market 

dislocation and major disasters. We fund ourselves principally by issuing long-term debt instruments, from deposits at our bank subsidiary, by issuing hybrid financial instruments and from cash flow from operations. 
 
 The proportion of our funding represented by customer deposits has been increasing, and we intend to for this proportion to continue to increase going forward as part of our funding strategy. We obtain deposits directly from retail and commercial customers and through brokerage firms that offer our deposit products to their customers. However, customer deposits are subject to fluctuation due to certain factors outside our control, such as increasing competitive pressures for retail or corporate customer deposits, changes in interest rates and returns on other investment classes, or a loss of confidence by customers in us or in the banking sector generally, any of which could result in a significant outflow of deposits within a short period of time. To the extent there is heightened competition among Kazakhstan banks for retail customer deposits, this competition may increase the cost of procuring new deposits and or retaining existing deposits, and otherwise negatively affect our ability to grow our deposit base. An inability to grow, or any material decrease in, our deposits could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our liquidity needs. 
 
 Maintaining a diverse and appropriate funding strategy for our assets consistent with our wider strategic risk appetite and plan remains challenging, and any tightening of credit markets could have a material adverse impact on us. In particular, there is a risk that corporate and financial institution counterparties may seek to reduce their credit exposures to banks and other financial institutions, which may cause funding from these sources to no longer be available. Under these circumstances, we may need to seek funds from alternative sources, potentially at higher costs than has previously been the case or may be required to consider disposals of other assets not previously identified for disposal, to reduce our funding commitments. Widening credit spreads, as well as significant declines in the availability of credit, have in the past adversely affected our ability to borrow on a secured and unsecured basis and may do so in the future. If our available funding is limited or we are forced to fund our operations at a higher cost, these conditions may require us to curtail our business activities and increase our cost of funding, either of which could reduce our profitability, particularly in our businesses that involve investing, lending and market making. 
 
 We may need to raise additional capital, and we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available or available on attractive terms. 
 
 To satisfy or refinance existing obligations, support the development of our business, adapt to changing business conditions or carry out our growth strategy through acquisitions, we may require additional cash resources. If our existing resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain other borrowings, and we cannot be certain that such additional financing would be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. The sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders, and additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service costs and obligations and could impose operating and financial covenants that would further restrict our operations. 
 
 Reductions in our credit ratings or an increase in our credit spreads could adversely affect our business, liquidity and cost of funding. 
 
 On October 31, 2023, S&P Global Ratings affirmed the long-term credit rating of Freedom Holding Corp. at the B- level and long-term and short-term credit ratings of Freedom Finance JSC, Freedom Finance Europe Limited, Freedom Finance Global PLC and Bank Freedom Finance Kazakhstan JSC at the B B level. The ratings of Freedom Finance JSC and Bank Freedom Finance Kazakhstan JSC on the national scale were confirmed at the level of kzBB+ . S&P Global Ratings revised the outlook on Freedom Holding Corp. and its core subsidiaries to negative. 
 
 On August 24, 2023, S&P Global Ratings placed the ratings of FRHC, Freedom Finance JSC, Freedom Finance Europe Limited, Freedom Finance Global PLC and Bank Freedom Finance Kazakhstan JSC on CreditWatch with negative implications. Reasons provided by S&P Global Ratings for the CreditWatch designation included the risk that certain disclosures in the FRHC s annual report and recently published allegations by a third party could lead to a loss of critical counterparties and potentially weaken the FRHC s franchise. On October 31, 2023, S&P Global Ratings removed the ratings of FRHC and its core subsidiaries from CreditWatch on the basis that the immediate fallout from the allegations published by a third party was relatively contained. 

Freedom Finance Life JSC has a long-term issuer credit and financial strength rating of of BB- (stable outlook) and a rating on the Kazakhstan national scale of kzA- with a stable outlook, and Freedom Finance Insurance JSC has a B+ rating (stable outlook) and kzBBB Kazakhstan national scale rating with stable outlook, in each case from Standard & Poor s. These ratings were affirmed by Standard & Poor s on August 24, 2023. 
 
 Reductions in our credit ratings may adversely affect both our ability to obtain long-term funding and our credit spreads and resulting cost of such funding. Our cost of obtaining long-term unsecured funding is directly related to our credit spreads (the amount in excess of the interest rate of benchmark securities that we need to pay). Increases in our credit spreads can significantly increase our cost of this funding. Changes in credit spreads are continuous, market-driven, and subject at times to unpredictable and highly volatile movements. In addition, decreases in the credit rating of Freedom Finance JSC, or FRHC as its owner, may affect Freedom Finance JSC s brokerage license and impose certain requirements on FRHC as its owner with respect to Freedom Finance JSC s investment portfolio management capacity. Decreases in the credit rating of Bank Freedom Finance Kazakhstan JSC may also impose certain requirements on FRHC as its owner with regard to its regulatory status as a bank holding company in Kazakhstan. 
 
 Our investments expose us to a significant risk of capital loss. 
 
 We use a significant portion of our capital to engage in a variety of investment activities for our own account, as well as in our exchange-based market making activities. As of 31 March 2023, our assets included U.S. 2.4 billion of trading securities, approximately 52.6 of which consisted of corporate debt securities and approximately 42.7 of which consisted of non-U.S. sovereign debt securities. We have relied on leverage, including by entering into reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements, securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions, to increase the size of our proprietary securities portfolio. As a result, we may face risks of illiquidity, loss of principal and revaluation of assets. The companies in which we invest may concentrate on markets which are or may be disproportionately impacted by pressures in the sectors on which they focus, and their existing business operations or investment strategies may not perform as projected. As a result, we may suffer losses from our investment activities. Our proprietary portfolio is concentrated in the sovereign debt instruments of a few non-U.S. countries and debt and equities of a number of companies. A consequence of this investment strategy is that our investment returns could be materially and adversely affected if these investments do not perform as anticipated or if the market performs differently than we forecast. Moreover, because we rely on leverage in our portfolio, when an investment does not perform within the time horizon we project, we face the risk of either having to close the position at a time when the market price or liquidity might be unfavorable or extending financing arrangements beyond the time frame initially anticipated, which can result in paying higher financing costs than projected. If a significant investment such as this fails to perform as anticipated our return on investment, liquidity, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations could be materially negatively affected, and the magnitude of the loss could be significant. 
 
 Substantially all of our investing and market-making positions are marked-to-market on a daily basis and declines in asset values directly and immediately impact our earnings. Although we may take measures to manage market risk, such as employing position limits, hedging and using quantitative risk measures, we may incur significant losses from our trading activities due to leverage, market fluctuations, currency fluctuations and volatility. To the extent that we own assets, i.e., have long positions, a downturn in the value of those assets or markets could result in losses. Conversely, to the extent we have sold assets we do not own, i.e., have short positions, an upturn in those markets could expose us to potentially large losses as we attempt to cover our short positions by acquiring assets in a rising market. We cannot give assurance that our investing and market-making strategies will be effective in all situations or that those activities will always be profitable. For example, an increase in interest rates, a general decline in debt or equity markets, an inability to properly and cost effectively hedge, economic slowdowns, delays in timing of anticipated events, an inability to identify and engage suitable counterparties, or other market conditions adverse to entities or investments of the type in which we invest or for which we make markets, or other world events, such as wars, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, natural disasters or the outbreak of a pandemic such as Covid-19, could result in a decline in the value of our investments. Additionally, changes in existing laws, rules or regulations, or judicial or administrative interpretations thereof, or new laws, rules or regulations could have an adverse impact on our investments. 
 
 We are dependent upon our relationships with third-party U.S.-registered securities broker-dealer and clearing firms to receive and transmit securities and funds internationally. 

We provide our brokerage customers with access to the U.S. stock markets, and a significant amount of our brokerage business relates to trading in U.S.-listed securities by our brokerage customers. Our Freedom Capital Markets subsidiary is not a licensed clearing firm. We rely on the services of a limited number of third-party U.S.-registered securities broker dealer and clearing firms to execute these trades. In executing purchase transactions, we transmit the funds invested by our customers to the relevant U.S.-registered securities broker-dealer and clearing firms, which execute the purchases of the securities. In executing sales, funds from the sale of securities are transmitted from such U.S.-registered securities broker dealer and clearing firms back to us through international banking electronic transfers. We also routinely evaluate opportunities to establish relationships with other U.S.-registered securities broker-dealer and clearing firms. While part of our strategy is to consider acquiring an ownership interest in a self-clearing company in the United States in the future on an opportunistic basis in order to provide us additional access to the U.S. stock markets, there can be no assurance that we will ultimately do so. Damage to or the loss of our relationships with the U.S. registered securities broker-dealer and clearing firm on which we currently rely could impair our ability to continue to provide our customers access to the U.S. markets at the volumes and in the manner they are accustomed to and could result in higher transaction costs for us or our customers, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 We may suffer significant loss from changes in the KASE s requirements related to the discount coefficients on the securities in securities repurchase transactions. 
 
 As part of our investment activities, both as an intermediary between borrowers and lenders and on a proprietary basis, we raise funds through repurchase transactions on the KASE. Our short-term financing is primarily obtained through securities repurchase arrangements. The securities we pledge as collateral under repurchase agreements are liquid trading securities with market quotes and significant trading volume. Depending on the reliability of the instrument used to secure the repurchase transaction, the KASE has established the size of the discount for securities. The discount is a decreasing coefficient that sets the maximum borrowing amount for repurchase transactions in relation to each individual instrument. In the event of unexpected changes in the terms of the discount, we may incur financial losses associated with the need to sell securities to cover liquidity at a cost disadvantageous to us, or due to the need to borrow necessary funds at higher rates. 
 
 Our modeling and assumptions used in assessing risks in our insurance business may differ materially from actual results. 
 
 We use modeling and forecasts to estimate exposures, loss trends and other risks, and to assist us in decision-making related to underwriting, pricing, capital allocation, and other issues associated with our insurance businesses. Our models and forecasts are subject to various unverifiable assumptions, uncertainties, model design errors, complexities and inherent limitations, including those arising from the use of historical internal, industry, and unverified, third party-provided data and assumptions. If, based upon these models, forecasts or other factors, we misprice our products or fail to correctly estimate the associated risks, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be materially adversely affected. 
 
 We also establish and monitor underwriting guidelines and an approval process for assessing and addressing risks and their limits however, we cannot assure that the assumptions our guidelines and limits are based on, or the analysis of those assumptions, are correct or will accurately reflect future results. As a result, we cannot be assured that these guidelines and approval process will be effective in mitigating our underwriting risks. 
 
 In our insurance business, we may not be able to obtain reinsurance at required levels or prices, or otherwise collect on reinsurance, which could increase our exposure or limit our ability to write new policies. 
 
 The availability and cost of reinsurance are dependent on market conditions beyond our control. As a result, reinsurance may not be continuously available to us to the extent and on the terms, we require to write new business. If we cannot obtain reinsurance or purchase reinsurance at acceptable prices, we would have to either accept an increase in our exposure or reduce our insurance exposure by limiting writing new policies that we think necessitate reinsurance protections, either of which could have a materially adverse effect on our insurance businesses. 
 
 Further, our reinsurance programs have counterparty risk that may result in uncollectible claims. Collectability from reinsurers is subject to factors such as whether reinsurers have the financial capacity to make payments, whether insured losses meet the conditions of the reinsurance contract, and whether the reinsurer otherwise disputes 

coverage. Our inability to recover from reinsurers, for any reason, could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business prospects. 
 
 We are dependent on our executive management team, particularly Timur Turlov, and our ability to hire and retain skilled personnel. 
 
 We depend on the efforts, skills, reputations and business contacts of our executive management team, in particular Timur Turlov, and the management teams of our subsidiaries. These individuals have made significant contributions to our success, and we believe our success moving forward depends, to a significant extent, on the experience of these individuals, whose continued service is not guaranteed. If certain individuals leave or are otherwise no longer available to us for any reason, we may not be able to replace them with comparable capable personnel. Due to Mr. Turlov s importance to our company, we would be materially adversely affected if Mr. Turlov ceased to actively participate in the management of our business or left the company entirely. We do not hold key man life insurance on Mr. Turlov or any of our other officers or directors. 
 
 In addition to the importance of Mr. Turlov and other executive management in our continued growth and success, we are dependent, in part, on our continued ability to hire, adequately train and retain skilled employees. The pool of experienced and qualified employee candidates is limited in some of the geographical areas where we conduct business, and competition for skilled employees can be significant. Additionally, we rely on experienced managerial, marketing and support personnel to effectively manage and operate our business. If we fail in engaging and retaining skilled employees and other personnel or if we experience a loss of such personnel, we may be unable to meet our objectives and, as a result, our business may suffer. 
 
 Extraordinary events beyond our control could negatively impact our business. 
 
 Our business and operations could be seriously disrupted, and our reputation could be harmed by events or contributing factors that are wholly or partially beyond our control. The occurrence of such extraordinary events, including the emergence of pandemics or other widespread health emergency (or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency) persistent or recurring endemics political discord and civil unrest terrorist attacks cyber-attacks war and armed conflict (including but not limited to the Russia-Ukraine conflict) extreme weather events or other natural disasters failure of, or loss of access to, technology or operational systems, including any resulting loss of critical data power, telecommunications or internet outages or shutdowns of mass transit, could create, and in the cases of Covid-19, civil unrest in Kazakhstan in January 2022, and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, have created, and may continue to create, economic, governmental and financial disruptions, and could lead to operational difficulties (including shutdowns of our offices, quarantine, shelter in place and travel limitations) that could impair our ability to operate our business. 
 
 Risks Related to Information Technology and Cyber Security 
 
 Our brokerage, financial services, and banking operations are highly dependent on the continued and proper functioning of our information technology systems. 
 
 Our brokerage, financial services and banking businesses are highly dependent on processing, daily, a large number of communications and increasingly complex transactions across diverse markets, in various languages. These communications and transactions are accomplished primarily through electronic information technology systems IT that are comprised of a wide array of computer systems, software, server and network hardware, internet connectivity and underlying infrastructure that enable them to function. The financial, accounting, or other data processing systems we or the firms that clear transactions on behalf of our customers use may fail to operate properly, become disabled, or otherwise become unavailable, as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. 
 
 Events causing failures of our systems may include a disruption of electrical, communications, internet or other infrastructure, or related services, or our inability to access or use one or more of our facilities, as a result of any number of occurrences, including, but not limited to, the outbreak of a pandemic such as Covid-19, social unrest such as occurred in Kazakhstan in January 2022, or armed conflict such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict. For example, during the transition to the new calendar year 2023, Bank Freedom Finance Kazakhstan Bank JSC experienced a technical failure in processing transactions on its Multi Invest cards, because of which it incurred losses of 

approximately U.S. 3 million. After the error was identified, measures were taken to rectify the issue and provide for timely synchronization of the balances going forward. 
 
 If any of these systems do not operate properly or are disabled or otherwise unavailable, or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes, personnel, or systems related to the electronic communications and functionality our operations depend on, we could suffer impairment to our liquidity, financial loss, a disruption of business, liability to customers, regulatory intervention, or reputational damage. The inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our business operations. 
 
 Our Tradernet electronic trading platform is proprietary technology that plays a key role in both our customers use of our services and for other important aspects of our business. Errors, failures, delays, interruptions, disruptions, vulnerabilities, bugs, incompatibility, obsolescence, or similar issues with Tradernet, or the software or systems upon which Tradernet relies for its functionality, however caused, could result in business disruptions, financial loss, reputational damage, and other adverse impacts on our business. 
 
 We interact with large volumes of sensitive data that exposes us to IT breaches and other data security risks and liabilities. 
 
 Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential, personal, financial, and other information in our computer systems and networks. Our ability to operate our business, and specifically our electronic trading platform, Tradernet, depends on our ability to protect the computer systems, networks and databases that we operate and use from unauthorized intrusions of third parties, including cyber-attacks. Our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, spyware or other malicious code, and other evolving cyber security threats. 
 
 The occurrence of one or more of these events could (a) jeopardize confidential and other information processed by, stored in, and transmitted through our computer systems and networks or the computer systems and networks of our customers or other third parties with whom we conduct business or (b) otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of our customers or third parties with whom we conduct business. In addition, new and expanding data privacy laws and regulations are, or soon will be, in effect in many of the jurisdictions where we conduct business. These pose increasingly complex compliance challenges, which may increase compliance costs, and compliance failures could result in significant fines, penalties and liability. 
 
 We have previously experienced cyber security incidents which breached our information systems, but these were contained by our response teams and generated negligible impacts. There is also a possibility that we are not currently aware of certain undisclosed vulnerabilities in our IT systems and other assets. There is an increased likelihood that escalation of tensions from the Russia-Ukraine conflict could result in cyber-attacks that could either directly or indirectly impact our operations. Although our subsidiaries have implemented cyber security strategies for mitigating these risks, we cannot be sure that our network and information technology systems will not be subject to such issues, or, if they are, that we will be able to maintain the integrity of our customers and employees data or that malware or other technical or operational issues will not disrupt our network or systems and cause significant harm to our operations. If our services are affected by attacks or malware and this degrades our services, our products and services may be perceived as being vulnerable to cyber risk and the integrity of our data protection systems may be questioned. As a result, users and customers may curtail or stop using our products and services, and we might incur reputational damage, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties, reimbursement, or other compensatory costs. 
 
 As of the date of this report, most of our employees have returned to working on site rather than remotely, which we believe lessens the overall IT risks associated with widespread remote work. However, possible outbreaks or other events occur in the future, we may again be required to move a significant portion of our workforce to working remotely. We continue to use risk management and contingency plans and other precautions designed to address the heightened risk of cyber security breaches resulting from a significant remote work force. However, we cannot assure that such measures will continue to adequately protect our business in the event of future transitions of our workforce to remote working, as remote working environments may be less secure and more susceptible to cyber security threats. 

We do not maintain insurance policies to mitigate these risks because such insurance may not be available or may be more expensive than the perceived benefit. Any insurance that we may purchase to mitigate certain risks may not cover all losses. 
 
 The infrastructure on which our IT systems depend is subject to events that could interrupt our ability to operate. 
 
 The infrastructure upon which our operations and IT systems depend, including electrical communications and internet, and transportation and other services, are vulnerable to damage or disruptions from events outside our control, including natural disasters, military conflicts, power, telecommunications and internet unavailability or outages, terrorist acts, riots, government shutdown orders, changes in government regulation, equipment or system failures or an inability to access or operate such equipment or systems, human error or intentional wrongdoings, cyber-attacks or any other types of information technology security threats. 
 
 In addition, as we operate in emerging markets which may have an increased threat of terrorism, military conflict, social unrest or governmental interference with infrastructure, which could result in property damage, business interruption and damage to our brand or reputation. The local authorities may order our subsidiaries to temporarily shut down their entire networks or part or all of our networks may be shut down due to actions relating to military conflicts, social unrest or a nationwide strike. For example, during the social unrest in Kazakhstan that occurred in January 2022, the Kazakhstan government temporarily shut down access to the internet in the country, which resulted in severance of internal communications within our Kazakhstan subsidiaries. 
 
 Because we have employees in several locations in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan, Germany, Spain, Greece, France, the UAE, the UK, the U.S. and Cyprus, all of whom need to work and communicate as an integrated team, the functionality of the infrastructure affects our ability to conduct business. If a disruption occurs in one location and our employees in that location are unable to communicate with or travel to other locations, our ability to serve and interact with our customers may suffer. While we have contingency plans in place to address such issues, these plans may not always be deployed successfully or be adequate to fully offset the impacts of such disruptions. We do not maintain insurance policies to mitigate these risks because such insurance may not be available or may be more expensive than the perceived benefit. Further, any insurance that we may purchase to mitigate certain risks may not cover all losses. 
 
 In addition, the computers and data centers that process our trades and payments are in the same locale. If a catastrophic event were to occur at such a locale it may result in permanent data loss. More generally, substantial property and equipment loss, and disruption in operations as well as any defects in our systems or those of third parties or other difficulties could expose us to liability and materially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any outage or disruptive efforts could adversely impact our reputation and other aspects of our business. 
 
 Failure of third-party systems and operations on which we rely could adversely affect our business. 
 
 We rely on certain third-party computer systems or third-party service providers, including clearing systems, other broker-dealers, exchange systems, banking systems, internet service, co-location facilities, communications facilities, and other facilities. Any interruption in these third-party services, or deterioration in their performance, could be disruptive to our business. If our arrangement with any third-party is terminated, we may not be able to find an alternative source of systems support on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 Funds invested by our customers in securities of U.S. companies are transmitted by us to U.S. registered securities broker-dealer and clearing firms. Funds from the sale of securities are transmitted from such U.S. registered securities broker-dealer and clearing firms back to us through international banking electronic transfers, which can experience clerical and administrative mistakes, be subject to technical interruption, be delayed, or otherwise fail to work as planned. We do not have any control over these funds transfers. Failures or substantial delays in funds transfers could impair our customer relationships. Damage to or the loss of our relationships with these U.S. registered securities broker-dealer and clearing firms could also impair our ability to continue to offer such services to our customers which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. 

Our success also depends on the continued availability, development, and maintenance of the internet infrastructure globally and particularly in the countries in which we operate. This includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity and security for providing reliable internet services. Any disruption in network access provided by third parties or any failure by them to handle current or higher future volumes of use may significantly harm our business. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience interruptions and delays in service from time to time. Furthermore, we depend on hardware and software suppliers for prompt delivery, installation and service of servers and other equipment to deliver our services. 
 
 In connection with the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the Russian authorities have placed increased restrictions on access to the internet, including limiting global internet connections for Russian users, restricting access to certain internet sites and imposing regulations governing various information technology service providers. These restrictions increase the risks that we will not be able to adequately or timely communicate with customers who are Russian person to provide our services and could result in the loss of such business. 
 
 To remain competitive, we must keep pace with rapid technological change. 
 
 The global securities industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology, shifting industry standards and evolving trading systems, practices and techniques. Our customers needs and demands fluctuate with these changes. We are focused on anticipating and developing technologies to meet the constantly changing demands of the market through ongoing enhancement of our products, services and platforms. If our platforms and systems do not operate properly, are slow to market, provide customers with a poor user experience, or are non-competitive with the offering of our competitors, we could experience a loss in business that could reduce our earnings or cause a loss of revenue. 
 
 Our Tradernet electronic trading platform is proprietary technology that has taken substantial resources and time to build and requires continued development to remain competitive with other trading platforms. Adoption or development of superior platforms or technologies by our competitors may require us to devote substantial resources to the further development of Tradernet, or other platforms, to remain competitive. Our future success will depend in part on our ability to develop, adapt or acquire up-to-date technology that meets ever evolving industry standards. We may not always be correct or timely in our assessment of how technological changes may impact our business. If we are unable to develop, adapt to, access or acquire technology that meets or exceeds industry standards on a timely and cost-effective basis, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 For example, in Kazakhstan we have developed an online-based platform that integrates Kazakhstan government databases with our services, making our service offerings faster and more convenient than services without such integration. We do not control the relevant government databases and cannot guarantee that we will always have access to such databases or proper functionality with such databases. For us to expand this type of integrated product outside of Kazakhstan, we would be reliant on similar databases being available and able to integrate with our systems in the jurisdictions to which we expand, the availability of which will likely vary greatly among jurisdictions. 
 
 Furthermore, many of our competitors are larger, more experienced and have greater resources to devote to the development of new technologies and services. If we are unable to keep pace with their development efforts our customers may find our platforms and services less compelling, which could lead to customer losses or a reduction in the revenue we generate from our product and service offerings. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Operations in Emerging Markets 
 
 Emerging markets, such as many of the markets in which we operate, are subject to greater risks than more mature markets, including significant political, economic and legal risks. 
 
 Generally, investments in emerging markets are only suitable for sophisticated investors who fully appreciate the significance of the risks involved. Investors in emerging markets should be aware that these markets are subject to greater risk than more mature markets, including in some cases significant political, economic and legal risks, including 
 
 difficulties in enforcing legal rights 

corruption in certain countries 
 economic volatility and sustained economic down turns 
 restrictive changes in securities brokerage, financial services and banking laws 
 differing and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory regimes 
 unpredictable, uncertain and potentially adverse changes to tax regimes 
 difficulties in developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing a number of international operations

 political or social unrest, including domestic protests such as occurred in Kazakhstan in January 2022 and international conflicts, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict. 
 
 Emerging market governments and judiciaries often exercise broad, unchecked discretion and are susceptible to abuse and corruption. Investors should also note that emerging economies such as Kazakhstan are subject to rapid change and that the information set out herein may become outdated relatively quickly. Moreover, financial, political or social turmoil in any emerging market country can disrupt the local securities markets. 
 
 We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation risks. 
 
 Because our business is conducted in multiple countries, we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. This exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and can have a material impact on our financial statements. Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currencies of our subsidiaries include the Kazakhstan tenge, the euro, the Ukrainian hryvnia, the Uzbekistan som, the Kyrgyzstan som, the Azerbaijan manat, the Armenian dram, the British pound sterling and the United Arab Emirates dirham. For financial reporting purposes, those currencies are translated into U.S. dollars as the reporting currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet dates. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the reporting period. As the value of the functional currencies of our subsidiaries weakens against the U.S. dollar, we may realize losses arising as a result of translating such foreign currencies to U.S. dollars. Conversely, as the value of the U.S. dollar weakens against the functional currencies of our subsidiaries, we may realize gains arising as a result of currency translation. 
 
 Fluctuations in currency exchange rates have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations. For example, the countrywide unrest in Kazakhstan in January 2022 and again following the onset of the Russia-Ukraine conflict the government of Kazakhstan imposed rules that included strict restrictions on currency operations between residents and non-residents. Such rules may be imposed when the applicable regulator believes there exists a serious threat to the stability of payment balances, the foreign currency market or economic security and can have a significant impact on currency rate fluctuation. 
 
 In February and March 2022, the Kazakhstan tenge and Russian ruble depreciated significantly against major foreign currencies amid the geopolitical situation related to Russia-Ukraine conflict. However, Kazakhstan and Russia have since been able to strengthen the tenge and Russian ruble, respectively, with capital controls and higher interest rates, bringing them closer to pre-conflict levels. These fluctuations in our operating currencies resulted in losses on foreign exchange operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended 31 March 2022 and subsequent improvement in the first quarter of year ended 31 March 2023 as those currencies recovered. We cannot assure you that such currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely impact our operating results, cash flows and financial condition in the future. While we may employ strategies to hedge against currency fluctuations, the use of such strategies can also result in the loss of potential benefits that might result from favorable exchange rate fluctuations. 
 
 We face interest rate change risks. 
 
 Fluctuations in interest rates can impact our earnings. Declines in interest rates can have a detrimental effect on the interest we earn. A rise in interest rates could negatively impact us if we hold securities that have an inverse relationship with interest rates or where market conditions or the competitive environment induces us to raise our interest rates or replace deposits with higher cost funding sources without offsetting increases in yields on interest-earning assets. 

To reduce the negative impact of sanctions and other actions related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict on the Kazakhstan economy, the NBK raised the base rate from 10.25 to 16.75 per annum. The base rate was increased to produce a rise in deposit rates to levels needed to compensate for increased depreciation and inflation risks. This was needed to support financial and price stability and protect the savings of Kazakhstan citizens from depreciation. Russia similarly raised interest rates during this period. The rate increases contributed to a significant net loss on our trading securities, largely due to the revaluation of our bond positions. Further interest rate hikes in the future could have similar negative effects. 
 
 The economies of Kazakhstan and other countries in which we operate are vulnerable to external shocks and fluctuations in the global economy. 
 
 Shocks and fluctuations to the global economy may adversely impact Kazakhstan and the other countries in which we operate. For example, a substantial amount of our operations is conducted in Kazakhstan. We estimate that, for year ended 31 March 2023, approximately 68 of our total revenue and approximately 79 of our total net income was attributable to our operations in Kazakhstan, and as of 31 March 2023, approximately 84 of our total assets were attributable to our operations in Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan s economy and finances have been adversely affected by global financial developments and political changes. Real GDP growth decreased from 4.2 in 2014 to 1.2 in 2015 and 1.1 in 2016 before increasing to 4.1 in 2017, 4.1 in 2018, and 4.5 in 2019. GDP then contracted by 2.5 in 2020 due to the direct and indirect impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, including the sharp decline in oil prices following the outbreak of the pandemic. In 2021, GDP growth was 4.3 . In 2022, GDP growth decreased to 3.2 in part due to the decreased oil production and supply-chain disruptions caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, The decrease in the GDP growth rate from 2014 to 2016 was principally attributable to a decrease in global demand for oil and gas and the resulting decrease in oil production and a fall in oil prices. While in recent years Kazakhstan has sought to diversify its economy and, in particular, to increase exports of manufacturing products, Kazakhstan continues to remain heavily reliant on the oil and gas industry and on hydrocarbon exports. 
 
 Changes in both the global and domestic environment have resulted in, among other things, lower liquidity levels across the banking sector, tighter credit conditions for Kazakhstan companies generally and fluctuating global demand for, and instability in, the price of crude oil and other commodities and downward pressure on the tenge. For example, the tenge depreciated significantly relative to the U.S. dollar in 2018 mainly due to significant deterioration of external factors, such as depreciation of the Russian ruble and the decrease in crude oil prices (starting from October 2018) due to increased oil reserves and oil production by principal exporters. The tenge depreciated relative to the U.S. dollar by 10.4 in 2020 primarily due to a sharp fall in oil prices caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result of the onset of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the tenge depreciated by 8.0 relative to the U.S. dollar during the quarter ended 31 March 2022. However, during year ended 31 March 2023 the value of the tenge largely stabilized and appreciated by 3.1 against the U.S. dollar. 
 
 Kazakhstan and other countries remain vulnerable to external shocks and the economic performance of their trading partners. A significant decline in economic growth in the EU or in any of a country s other major trading partners, including Russia (whether or not resulting from international sanctions), could have a material adverse effect on such country s balance of trade and adversely affect its economic growth. Weaknesses in the global economy, or a future external economic crisis, may have a negative effect on economies or investors confidence in the markets where we operate. Such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. 
 
 Kazakhstan s economy is vulnerable to internal political and social unrest. 
 
 The countrywide unrest in Kazakhstan that occurred in January 2022 resulted in major interruptions to Kazakhstan s financial market. As a result of shutdowns (or restrictions on access to) the internet and the state of emergency declared by the president of Kazakhstan, our Kazakhstan subsidiaries, along with other financial institutions in Kazakhstan, were unable to conduct operations or operated with limited functionality during the unrest. We are currently exploring the possibility of obtaining alternative ways to access the internet in the case of such emergency situations and to eliminate or mitigate the consequences of losing access to the internet. This event also resulted in significant changes to the Kazakhstan government and reshuffling of government officials, which could in turn result in future impacts to the financial markets in Kazakhstan, including possible amendments to legislation that may limit or make it more difficult or expensive to conduct our operations or make our services less attractive to our customers. 

Economic and political instability in Russia could have an adverse effect on our business. 
 
 Although we have completed the divestiture of our Russian subsidiaries, we continue to do business with Russian persons, both directly and indirectly through our transactions with FST Belize. As a result, our business and results of operations may be significantly impacted by economic and political conditions in Russia. Over the last two decades, the Russian economy has experienced and may continue to experience at various times 
 
 significant volatility in its GDP 
 the impact of international sanctions 
 high levels of inflation 
 increases in, or high, interest rates 
 sudden price declines in oil and other natural resources 
 instability in the local currency market 
 lack of reform in the banking sector and a weak banking system providing limited liquidity to Russian enterprises 
 budget deficits 
 the continued operation of loss-making enterprises due to the lack of effective bankruptcy proceedings 
 capital flight and 
 significant increases in poverty rates, unemployment and underemployment. 
 
 Beyond the risks associated with these economic conditions and the Russia-Ukraine conflict risks discussed in Risks Related to the Russia-Ukraine Conflict , other notable risks related to the Russian political regime and our doing business with Russian persons include the risks of implementation of government policies targeted at specific individuals or companies, laws restricting foreign investment, Russian anti-money laundering legislation adversely impacting our transaction volumes and mandatory U.S. and EU sanctions screening being inhibited by Russian data privacy laws and constraints. 
 
 Taxation Risks Related to Our International Operations 
 
 Global anti-of shore measures could adversely impact our business. 
 
 In 2013, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD and G20 countries accepted that existing international tax rules create opportunities for base erosion and profit shifting. Pursuing solutions to this problem, the OECD and G20 countries adopted a 15-point Action Plan to Base Erosion and Profit Shifting BEPS ). The BEPS package of measures represents a substantial revision of international tax rules. In light of the new measures, it is expected that profits will be reported where the economic activities that generate them are carried out and where value is created. 
 
 The Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters developed by the Council of Europe and the OECD in 1988 and amended by Protocol in 2010 has now been signed by 141 jurisdictions (including Kazakhstan, Cyprus and Russia). This convention requires competent authorities of jurisdictions-signatories to participate in the exchange of information that is foreseeably relevant for the administration or enforcement of their domestic laws concerning taxes. In 2016 Russia (and in 2018 Kazakhstan) joined the Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information (Common Reporting Standard) (the CRS ). The CRS calls on jurisdictions to obtain information from their financial institutions and automatically exchange that information with other jurisdictions on an annual basis. 
 
 The foregoing developments regarding global information exchange could complicate our tax planning as well as related business decisions and could possibly expose us to significant fines and penalties and to enforcement measures, despite our best efforts at compliance, and could result in a greater than expected tax burden. 
 
 On November 24, 2016, the OECD published the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS (the MLI which introduces new provisions to existing double tax treaties limiting the use of tax benefits provided thereby. As a minimum standard, the MLI implements a principal purposes test, under which treaty benefits are disallowed if one of the principal purposes of the transaction or the structure was to obtain a tax benefit. The MLI was ratified by Cyprus on 20 January 2020 and by Kazakhstan on 20 February 2020. Application of the MLI could potentially limit tax benefits granted under the double tax treaties of Cyprus and Kazakhstan. 

Tax law changes in regions where we conduct operations could adversely affect our business and the value of investments. 
 
 We are subject to a broad range of taxes and other compulsory payments, including, but not limited to, income tax, VAT and social contributions. Tax laws have been in force for a short period relative to tax laws in more developed market economies, and the implementation of these tax laws is still unclear or inconsistent. The tax laws and regulations in our regions outside the U.S. are subject to frequent changes, varying and contradicting interpretations, and inconsistent and selective enforcement. 
 
 The Transfer Pricing Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan, dated July 5, 2008, provides for three-level transfer pricing documentation, including a country-by-country report (CbCR). Under the mandatory filing requirements or CbCR in Kazakhstan, if we reach the reporting threshold established for the group s consolidated revenue (e. g. EUR 750 million) we may be required to submit relevant CbCR reports. It continues to be unclear how the above measures will be applied by the tax authorities and courts. Notably, there is uncertainty about the types of income that should be included in the group s consolidated revenue for CbCR purposes. Similar requirements are imposed by other jurisdictions in which we do business, including but not limited to Cyprus, and Uzbekistan. 
 
 Kazakhstan transfer pricing legislation may require pricing adjustments and impose additional tax liabilities. 
 
 Under Kazakhstan transfer pricing legislation, the burden of proving market prices, as well as keeping specific documentation, lies with the taxpayers. In certain circumstances, the local tax authorities may apply the transfer pricing rules and methods in cases where the rules are formally not applicable, claiming additional tax charges calculated using the transfer rules but based on other tax concepts (e.g., anti-avoidance rules, lack of economic justification of expenses, etc.). Our subsidiaries in Kazakhstan could become subject to transfer pricing tax audits by the Kazakhstan tax authorities in the foreseeable future. As a result of such audits, the tax authorities could challenge the level of prices applied by us under controlled transactions (including certain intercompany transactions) or challenge the methods used to prove prices applied by us, and as a result we may accrue additional tax liabilities. If additional taxes are assessed with respect to these matters, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. 
 
 Uncertainties and ongoing changes in Kazakhstan s tax regime may have an adverse impact on our business. 
 
 Kazakhstan s tax regime is subject to ongoing changes, resulting in uncertainties in the interpretation and application of its tax laws. For example, the Kazakhstan government has taken steps to promote investment in its financial markets, including providing a preferential tax regime within the AIFC established by the Constitutional Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan dated December 7, 2015 On the Astana International Financial Center . Among other tax benefits, there is an exemption from corporate income tax on commission income earned by an AIFC-registered member from rendering defined financial services in the AIFC. It is currently unclear whether an AIFC-registered member is eligible for the tax benefits if, for example, it renders services online through employees working outside the AIFC. As a result of these uncertainties, the availability of these new tax exemptions to us is currently unclear. 
 
 Another tax risk we face is associated with corporate tax residency in Kazakhstan. Notably, when an entity is recognized as a Kazakhstan tax resident it is obligated to register with the Kazakhstan tax authorities, calculate and pay Kazakhstan income tax on its worldwide income and comply with other tax-related rules established for Kazakhstan entities. There is uncertainty as to how these residency criteria will be treated and applied by the Kazakhstan tax authorities to FRHC. 
 
 There is also uncertainty regarding determination of the beneficial owner of income under Kazakhstan tax law, for purposes of double-tax treaties. In particular, to date, there are still no officially approved requirements for the documentation to be obtained from the recipient of income claiming beneficial owner status. In case one of our non-Kazakhstan subsidiaries is not able to provide evidence that it is a beneficial owner of the income which it receives from one of our Kazakhstan subsidiaries, benefits under a double tax treaty will not be applicable, as a result of which the Kazakhstan subsidiary would be required to withhold taxes from such payment at the rate provided by the Tax Code of Kazakhstan without any reductions or exemptions from taxation in Kazakhstan. This could lead to additional tax liabilities for our companies. 

More generally, Kazakhstan tax legislation is subject to frequent changes, varying and potentially contradicting interpretations and inconsistencies. There can be no assurance that Kazakhstan tax legislation will be amended in the future in a manner that makes our tax planning more predictable. Further, the introduction of new taxes, amendments to current taxation rules, or new interpretations of existing tax law may have a substantial impact on the overall amount of our tax liabilities. As a result, there is no assurance that we will not be required to make substantially larger tax payments in the future, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Changes in regulations related to taxes on stock transfers and other financial transactions could reduce the volume of market transactions and impact our business. 
 
 Changes to laws or regulations, such as tax laws, could also have a disproportionate impact on our business or profitability, based on the way those laws or regulations are applied to us due to our corporate structure. For example, the current U.S. presidential administration has proposed tax policy ideas that if enacted would, among other things, increase the corporate tax rate and the U.S. tax rate on Global Intangible Low Taxed Income GILTI ). 
 
 Because of certain tax advantages we realize in certain jurisdictions where we operate, the proposed changes in the GILTI tax rate by the current U.S. administration, which have not yet been adopted and may change significantly before being implemented, if at all, could result in significantly higher tax burdens on us in the U.S., which could offset some of the favorable tax advantages we realize in some of the jurisdictions where we conduct business. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure and Internal Operations 
 
 As a diversified holding company with few operations of its own, FRHC is reliant on the operations of our subsidiaries to fund its holding company operations. 
 
 Our operations are conducted primarily through the subsidiaries of FRHC, and FRHC s ability to generate cash to fund its operations and expenses, to pay dividends or to meet debt service obligations is highly dependent on the earnings and the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries through dividends or intercompany loans. Deterioration in the financial condition, earnings or cash flow of our subsidiaries for any reason, including the risks discussed herein as applicable or the occurrence of such events to any such subsidiary, could limit or impair their ability to pay such distributions to FRHC Additionally, to the extent our subsidiaries are restricted from making such distributions under applicable laws or regulations or under the terms of financing arrangements or are otherwise unable to provide funds to the extent of FRHC s needs, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. 
 
 As a controlled company under Nasdaq rules, we qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. 
 
 Timur Turlov controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, we qualify as a controlled company within the meaning of Nasdaq corporate governance standards. Under Nasdaq rules, a company of which more than 50 of the voting power is held by one individual is a controlled company and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance standards, including the requirements that 
 
 a majority of its board of directors consist of independent directors 
 its nominating and corporate governance committee and compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors 
 each committee have a written charter addressing such committee s purpose and responsibilities and 
 an annual evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance committee and compensation committee be performed. 
 
 We currently utilize an exemption to allow Timur Turlov to sit on our nominating and corporate governance committee. The charters for each of our board committees provides for annual performance evaluations. Currently we have a majority of independent directors on our board of directors. 
 
 The interests of our controlling shareholder may conflict with those of other shareholders. 

Timur Turlov, our chief executive officer and chairman of our board, beneficially owns 71.1 of our outstanding common stock. He currently has voting control of FRHC and can control the outcome of matters submitted to stockholders for approval. In addition, Mr. Turlov has the ability to control our management and affairs as a result of his position as our chief executive officer, chairman of our board and his ability to control the election of our directors. Mr. Turlov also has interests in other companies, certain of which, in particular FST Belize, conduct significant amounts of business with our company. Such related party transactions give rise to a risk of the conclusion of transactions on terms less favorable than could be obtained in arm s length transactions. The interests of Mr. Turlov could conflict with those of the stockholders. Any such conflict could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and prospects. 
 
 Mr. Turlov is prohibited from membership on the audit committee of our board under the terms of such committee s charter. As majority shareholder, Mr. Turlov owes fiduciary duties to minority shareholders under Nevada law. Mr. Turlov also owes fiduciary duties to the Company as a board member and officer. However, Nevada corporate law can be viewed as more protective of officers and directors than the corporate laws of other U.S. state jurisdictions, and it therefore may not provide the same level of redress as other U.S. state corporate laws. 
 
 Civil liability may be difficult or impossible to enforce against us. 
 
 Certain of our directors, substantially all of our officers, and our controlling shareholder reside outside the U.S., and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the U.S. in jurisdictions that are not parties to treaties or other agreements with the U.S. for the mutual enforcement of U.S. court judgments. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for investors to enforce against us or such person s judgments of U.S. courts. 
 
 For example, the Civil Procedure Code of Kazakhstan, which became effective on January 1, 2016, provides that Kazakhstan courts should recognize and enforce foreign court judgments only if provided for by Kazakhstan law or an international treaty to which Kazakhstan is a party (based on reciprocity). Kazakhstan is not a party to any multilateral or bilateral treaties with the U.S. or the UK (or most other western jurisdictions) for the mutual enforcement of court judgments, and, accordingly, there is a risk that a judgment obtained from a court in New York or England would not be enforceable in Kazakhstan courts. Each of Kazakhstan, the U.S. and the UK are, however, parties to the 1958 New York Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Arbitral Awards (the Convention ), and, accordingly, an arbitral award under the Convention should generally be recognized and enforceable in Kazakhstan provided the conditions to enforcement set out in the Convention and applicable Kazakhstan laws are met. The Civil Procedure Code of Kazakhstan establishes the procedure for the enforcement of foreign arbitral awards. 
 
 We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and may identify material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price. 
 
 We are required to comply with the SEC s rules implementing Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act ), which requires management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and to comply with the SEC s rules implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires management to provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Additionally, we are required to have our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm needs to issue an adverse report if there is a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. When evaluating our internal control over financial reporting, we may identify material weaknesses that we may not be able to remediate prior to the date of our annual management report. During the year ended 31 March 2023, the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, after discussion with management, concluded that certain reports previously filed with the SEC included material misstatements. These reports have already been amended and filed with the SEC. 
 
 In connection with such errors, we concluded that there is a material weakness due to deficiency in one of the principles associated with the Control Environment component of the COSO framework, specifically relating to a 

lack of a sufficient complement of qualified technical accounting and financial reporting personnel to perform control activities in support of preparing the financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Control Environment material weakness contributed to other material weaknesses, either individually or in the aggregate, related to the design of our controls over (i) the application of U.S.GAAP to complex transactions, (ii) the classification of certain loans and deposits from banking institutions within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, (iii) the classification of certain interest income from margin lending within the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive Income, (iv) the classification of funds received under the Kazakhstan state program for financing of mortgage loans 7-20-25 within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and (v) the review and timely identification of misstatements in the notes to the Consolidation Financial Statements. 
 
 We have commenced measures in response to the material weaknesses identified above. Management, with the oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, has evaluated the material weaknesses described above and designed a remediation plan to enhance our internal control environment. To remediate the material weaknesses, we plan to (a) provide training on U.S.GAAP to employees responsible for preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements (b) hire qualified accounting professionals with the appropriate level of expertise in U.S. GAAP and ability to design, maintain and improve procedures and controls focused on the application of U.S. GAAP to complex transactions and preventing and detecting material misstatements in the presentation and disclosures of the Consolidated Financial Statement and (c) engage an external consulting firm to assist the Company in maintaining compliance with its U.S. GAAP reporting requirements. 
 
 Until the material weaknesses are remediated, we will continue to perform additional analysis and other post-closing procedures to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The material weaknesses cannot be considered remediated until the newly designed control activities operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that the controls are operating effectively. We can give no assurance that the measures we are taking and plan to take in the future will remediate the material weaknesses identified, or that any additional material weaknesses or restatements of financial results will not arise in the future due to a failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or circumvention of these controls. In addition, even if we are successful in strengthening our internal controls over financial reporting, in the future those controls may not be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or errors or to facilitate the fair presentation of our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely impact our ability to report our financial position and results of operations on a timely and accurate basis. If our financial statements are inaccurate, investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations and we could face the risk of stockholder litigation. Likewise, if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.
