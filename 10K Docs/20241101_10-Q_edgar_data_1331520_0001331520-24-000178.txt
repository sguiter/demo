Forward-looking statements relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future financial performance, future plans and strategies, and anticipated events or trends, and include statements about the competitiveness of the banking industry, potential regulatory obligations, our entrance and expansion into other markets, including through potential acquisitions, our other business strategies and other statements that are not historical facts. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance or results. When we use words like may, plan, contemplate, anticipate, believe, intend, continue, expect, project, predict, estimate, could, should, would, and similar expressions, you should consider them as identifying forward-looking statements, although we may use other phrasing. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and are based on our beliefs and assumptions, and on the information available to us at the time that these disclosures were prepared. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and may not be realized due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the following: 
 the effects of future local, regional, national and international economic conditions, including inflation or a decrease in commercial real estate and residential housing values; 
 changes in the level of nonperforming assets and charge-offs, and credit risk generally; 
 the risks of changes in interest rates or the level and composition of deposits, loan demand and the values of loan collateral, securities and interest-sensitive assets and liabilities; 
 disruptions, uncertainties and related effects on credit quality, liquidity, other aspects of our business and our operations that may result from any future public health crises; 
 the ability to identify, complete and successfully integrate new acquisitions; 
 the risk that expected cost savings and other benefits from acquisitions may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; 
 diversion of management time on acquisition-related issues; 
 the availability of and access to capital and liquidity on terms acceptable to us; 
 increased regulatory requirements and supervision that applies as a result of our having over 10 billion in total assets; 
 legislation and regulation affecting the financial services industry as a whole, and the Company and its subsidiaries in particular, and future legislative and regulatory changes; 
 changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies; 
 the effects of terrorism and efforts to combat it, political instability, war, military conflicts (including the ongoing military conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine) and other major domestic or international events; 
 the impacts of recent or future adverse weather events, including hurricanes, and other natural disasters; 
 the ability to keep pace with technological changes, including changes regarding cybersecurity; 
 an increase in the incidence or severity of, or any adverse effects resulting from, acts of fraud, illegal payments, cybersecurity breaches or other illegal acts impacting our bank subsidiary, our vendors or our customers; 
 the effects of competition from other commercial banks, thrifts, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, credit unions, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market and other mutual funds and other financial institutions operating in our market area and elsewhere, including institutions operating regionally, nationally and internationally, together with competitors offering banking products and services by mail, telephone and the Internet; 
 potential claims, expenses and other adverse effects related to current or future litigation, regulatory examinations or other government actions; 
 potential increases in deposit insurance assessments, increased regulatory scrutiny, investment portfolio losses, or market disruptions resulting from financial challenges in the banking industry; 
 the effect of changes in accounting policies and practices and auditing requirements, as may be adopted by the regulatory agencies, as well as the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, and other accounting standard setters; 
 higher defaults on our loan portfolio than we expect; and

 Debt securities available-for-sale ("AFS") are reported at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity and other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes. Securities that are held as available-for-sale are used as a part of our asset/liability management strategy. Securities that may be sold in response to interest rate changes, changes in prepayment risk, the need to increase regulatory capital, and other similar factors are classified as available-for-sale. The Company evaluates all securities quarterly to determine if any securities in a loss position require a provision for credit losses. The Company first assesses whether it intends to sell or is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For securities that do not meet these criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, and changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows

 in AFS reserves due to an improvement in the unrealized loss position of one of the Company's subordinated debt investments. For both the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, the Company determined the million allowance for credit losses on the held-to-maturity portfolio was adequate. Therefore, no additional provision was considered necessary for the HTM portfolio.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had available-for-sale investment securities with approximately million in unrealized losses, of which million had been in continuous loss positions for more than twelve months. With the exception of the subordinated debt investment securities which were downgraded during 2023 resulting in the allowance, the Company s assessments indicated the cause of the market depreciation was primarily due to the change in interest rates and not the issuer s financial condition or downgrades by rating agencies. In addition, approximately of the principal balance from the Company s investment portfolio will mature or are expected to pay down within . As a result, the Company has the ability and intent to hold such securities until maturity.

 investment securities, of which were in an unrealized loss position. As noted in the table above, the total amount of the unrealized loss was million. The U.S. government-sponsored enterprises portfolio contained unrealized losses of million on securities. The U.S. government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities portfolio contained million of unrealized losses on securities, and the private mortgage-backed securities portfolio contained million of unrealized losses on securities. The non-government-sponsored asset backed securities portfolio contained million of unrealized losses on securities. The state and political subdivisions portfolio contained million of unrealized losses on securities. In addition, the other securities portfolio contained million of unrealized losses on securities. With the exception of the investments for which an allowance for credit losses has been established, the unrealized losses on the Company's investments were primarily a result of interest rate changes, and the Company expects to recover the amortized cost basis over the term of the securities. The Company has determined that, as of September 30, 2024, an additional provision for credit losses is not necessary because the decline in market value was attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, and because the Company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company's held-to-maturity securities portfolio consisted of investment securities, of which were in an unrealized loss position. As noted in the table above, the total amount of the unrealized loss was million. The U.S. government-sponsored enterprises portfolio contained unrealized losses of million on securities. The U.S. government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities portfolio contained unrealized losses of million on securities. The state and political subdivisions portfolio contained million of unrealized losses on securities. The unrealized losses on the Company's investments were a result of interest rate changes. The Company expects to recover the amortized cost basis over the term of the securities. Because the decline in market value was attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, the Company has determined that an additional provision for credit losses was not necessary as of September 30, 2024.

 Mortgage loans held for sale of approximately million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, are included in residential 1-4 family loans. Mortgage loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, determined using an aggregate basis. Gains and losses resulting from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the respective loans are sold to investors. Gains and losses are determined by the difference between the selling price and the carrying amount of the loans sold, net of discounts collected or paid. The Company obtains forward commitments to sell mortgage loans to reduce market risk on mortgage loans in the process of origination and mortgage loans held for sale. The forward commitments acquired by the Company for mortgage loans in process of origination are considered mandatory forward commitments. Because these commitments are structured on a mandatory basis, the Company is required to substitute another loan or to buy back the commitment if the original loan does not fund. The Company regularly sells mortgages into the capital markets to mitigate the effects of interest rate volatility during the period from the time an interest rate lock commitment IRLC is issued until the IRLC funds creating a mortgage loan held for sale and its subsequent sale into the secondary/capital markets. Loan sales are typically executed on a mandatory basis. Under a mandatory commitment, the Company agrees to deliver a specified dollar amount with predetermined terms by a certain date. Generally, the commitment is not loan specific, and any combination of loans can be delivered into the outstanding commitment provided the terms fall within the parameters of the commitment. Upon failure to deliver, the Company is subject to fees based on market movement. These commitments and IRLCs are derivative instruments and their fair values at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were not material.

The loan to value ratio depends on the type of collateral. Generally, accounts receivable are financed at between and of accounts receivable less than 60 days past due. Inventory financing will range between and (with no work in process) depending on the borrower and nature of inventory. We require a first lien position for those loans. 
 Consumer Other Loans. Our consumer other loans are primarily composed of loans to finance USCG registered high-end sail and power boats. The performance of consumer other loans will be affected by the local and regional economies as well as the rates of personal bankruptcies, job loss, divorce and other individual-specific characteristics. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures. The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance for credit loss on off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit loss expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life. The Company uses the DCF method to estimate expected losses for all of the Company s off-balance sheet credit exposures through the use of the existing DCF models for the Company s loan portfolio pools. The off-balance sheet credit exposures exhibit similar risk characteristics as loans currently in the Company s loan portfolio.

 Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. For these loans, where the Company has determined that foreclosure of the collateral is probable, or where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and the Company expects repayment of the financial asset to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, the allowance for credit losses is measured based on the difference between the fair value of the collateral, net of estimated costs to sell, and the amortized cost basis of the loan as of the measurement date. When repayment is expected to be from the operation of the collateral, expected credit losses are calculated as the amount by which the amortized cost basis of the loan exceeds the present value of expected cash flows from the operation of the collateral. When repayment is expected to be from the sale of the collateral, expected credit losses are calculated as the amount by which the amortized cost basis of the loan exceeds the fair value of the underlying collateral less

 The Company closely monitors the performance of the loans that are modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to understand the effectiveness of its modification efforts. The Company has modified loans over the past 12 months to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The pre-modification balance of the loans was million, and the ending balance as of September 30, 2024 was million. The million balance consists of million of non-accrual loans and of current loans, of which were 60-89 days past due. The remaining balance of the loans was current as of September 30, 2024. 
 Upon the Company's determination that a modified loan (or portion of a loan) has subsequently been deemed uncollectible, the loan (or a portion of the loan) is written off. Therefore, the amortized cost basis of the loan is reduced by the uncollectible amount and the allowance for credit losses on loans is adjusted by the same amount. The defaults impact the loss rate by applicable loan pool for the quarterly CECL calculation. For individually analyzed loans which are not considered to be collateral dependent, an allowance is recorded based on the loss rate for the respective pool within the collective evaluation.

 Stock-based compensation expense for stock-based compensation awards granted is based on the grant-date fair value. For stock option awards, the fair value is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, changes to which can materially affect the fair value estimate. Additionally, there may be other factors that would otherwise have a significant effect on the value of employee stock options granted but are not considered by the model. Accordingly, while management believes that the Black-Scholes option-pricing model provides a reasonable estimate of fair value, the model does not necessarily provide the best single measure of fair value for the Company's employee stock options. There were options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The fair value of each option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the weighted-average assumptions for expected dividend yield, expected stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected life of options granted.

 Outstanding standby letters of credit are contingent commitments issued by the Company, generally to guarantee the performance of a customer in third-party borrowing arrangements. The term of the guarantee is dependent upon the creditworthiness of the borrower, some of which are long-term. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary, is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, commercial real estate and residential real estate.

 of the day-one impact of adopting CECL and of the cumulative change in the reported allowance for credit losses since adopting CECL. The Company elected to adopt the interim final rule, which is reflected in the Company's risk-based capital ratios. 
 Basel III became effective for the Company and its bank subsidiary on January 1, 2015. Basel III amended the prompt corrective action rules to incorporate a CET1 requirement and to raise the capital requirements for certain capital categories. In order to be adequately capitalized for purposes of the prompt corrective action rules, a banking organization is required to have at least a CET1 risk-based capital ratio, a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and an total risk-based capital ratio. 
 The Federal Reserve Board s risk-based capital guidelines include the definitions for (1) a well-capitalized institution, (2) an adequately-capitalized institution, and (3) an undercapitalized institution. Under Basel III, the criteria for a well-capitalized institution are: a CET1 risk-based capital ratio, a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio, an Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, and a total risk-based capital ratio. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank met the capital standards for a well-capitalized institution. The Company s CET1 risk-based capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage capital ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, and total risk-based capital ratio were , , , and , respectively, as of September 30, 2024.

The Company reversed and million of accrued interest receivable when impaired loans were put on non-accrual status during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Foreclosed assets held for sale Foreclosed assets held for sale are held by the Company at fair value, less estimated costs to sell. At foreclosure, if the fair value, less estimated costs to sell, of the real estate acquired is less than the Company s recorded investment in the related loan, a write-down is recognized through a charge to the allowance for credit losses. Additionally, valuations are periodically performed by management and any subsequent reduction in value is recognized by a charge to income. The fair value of foreclosed assets held for sale is estimated using Level 3 inputs based on appraisals of underlying collateral. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of foreclosed assets held for sale, less estimated costs to sell, was million and million, respectively.

 foreclosed assets held for sale were remeasured during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Regulatory guidelines require the Company to reevaluate the fair value of foreclosed assets held for sale on at least an annual basis. The Company s policy is to comply with the regulatory guidelines. 
 The significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs used in the fair value measurement of collateral for collateral-dependent impaired loans and foreclosed assets primarily relate to customized discounting criteria applied to the customer s reported amount of collateral. The amount of the collateral discount depends upon the condition and marketability of the underlying collateral. As the Company s primary objective in the event of default would be to monetize the collateral to settle the outstanding balance of the loan, less marketable collateral would receive a larger discount.

 Conway, Arkansas 
 Results of Review of Interim Consolidated Financial Statements 
 We have reviewed the condensed consolidated balance sheet of Home BancShares Inc. (the Company and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2024, and the related condensed consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), and stockholder s equity for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the interim financial information or statements ). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the condensed financial statements referred to above for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated February 26, 2024, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. 
 Basis for Review Results 
 These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

 Item 2: MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2024, which includes the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. Unless the context requires otherwise, the terms Company, us, we, and our refer to Home BancShares, Inc. on a consolidated basis. 
 
 General 
 We are a bank holding company headquartered in Conway, Arkansas, offering a broad array of financial services through our wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Centennial Bank (sometimes referred to as Centennial or the Bank ). As of September 30, 2024, we had, on a consolidated basis, total assets of 22.82 billion, loans receivable, net of allowance for credit losses of 14.51 billion, total deposits of 16.71 billion, and stockholders equity of 3.96 billion. 
 We generate the majority of our revenue from interest on loans and investments, service charges, and mortgage banking income. Deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB and other borrowed funds are our primary sources of funding. Our largest expenses are interest on our funding sources, salaries and related employee benefits and occupancy and equipment. We measure our performance by calculating our return on average common equity, return on average assets and net interest margin. We also measure our performance by our efficiency ratio, which is calculated by dividing non-interest expense less amortization of core deposit intangibles by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and non-interest income. The efficiency ratio, as adjusted, is a non-GAAP measure and is calculated by dividing non-interest expense less amortization of core deposit intangibles by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and non-interest income excluding adjustments such as merger and acquisition expenses and/or certain gains, losses and other non-interest income and expenses.

 Overview 
 Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Our net income increased 1.6 million, or 1.6 , to 100.0 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, from 98.5 million for the same period in 2023. On a diluted earnings per share basis, our earnings were 0.50 per share for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.49 per share for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. The Company recorded 18.9 million in credit loss expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The 18.9 million of credit loss expense includes 18.2 million in provision for credit losses on loans. Of the 18.2 million provision for credit losses on loans recorded, 16.7 million was used to establish a hurricane reserve for loans located in the Federal Emergency Management Agency ("FEMA") disaster areas impacted by Hurricane Helene, which made landfall during the quarter. The hurricane related reserve had a six-cent impact to diluted earnings per share for the quarter. The remaining portion of the provision was related to loan growth. The Company also recorded a 1.0 million provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments, and we recorded a 330,000 recovery of credit losses on available-for-sale investments due to an improvement in the unrealized losses for one of our subordinated debt investments. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a 1.4 million increase in the fair value of marketable securities. 
 Total interest income increased by 38.6 million, or 13.1 , and non-interest expense decreased 4.7 million, or 4.1 . This was partially offset by a 25.3 million, or 27.4 increase in total interest expense and a 634,000, or 1.5 , decrease in non-interest income. These fluctuations are primarily due to the high interest rate environment. The increase in interest income resulted from a 32.5 million, or 13.0 , increase in loan interest income and a 9.8 million, or 419.6 , increase in interest income on deposits at other banks, which was partially offset by a 3.7 million, or 8.7 , decrease in investment interest income. The decrease in non-interest expense was due to a decrease of 5.7 million, or 8.8 , in salaries and employee benefits and a decrease of 917,000, or 5.9 , in occupancy and equipment expense, which was partially offset by an increase of 1.9 million, or 7.3 , in other operating expenses. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to a 19.1 million, or 24.3 , increase in interest on deposits and a 6.2 million, or 76.2 , increase in interest on FHLB and other borrowed funds. The decrease in non-interest income was primarily due to a 3.1 million, or 69.1 , decrease in the fair value adjustment for marketable securities which was partially offset by a 1.3 million, or 41.7 , increase in mortgage lending income and a 1.3 million, or 21.6 , increase in other income. 
 Our net interest margin increased from 4.19 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 4.28 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. The yield on interest earning assets was 6.60 and 6.09 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and average interest earning assets increased from 19.26 billion to 20.23 billion. The increase in average interest earning assets is primarily due to a 706.1 million increase in average interest-bearing balances due from banks and a 571.2 million increase in average loans receivable, partially offset by a 315.8 million decrease in average investment securities. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company held excess liquidity of approximately 500.0 million which was dilutive to the net interest margin by approximately 10 basis points. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized 1.9 million and 2.4 million, respectively, in total net accretion for acquired loans and deposits. The reduction in accretion was dilutive to the net interest margin by two basis points. We recognized 573,000 in event income for the three-months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 521,000 for the three-months ended September 30, 2023. The remaining increase in the net interest margin was due to an increase in interest income resulting from an increase in average interest-bearing assets at higher interest rates primarily as a result of the high interest rate environment. 
 Our efficiency ratio was 41.42 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 45.53 for the same period in 2023. For the third quarter of 2024, our efficiency ratio, as adjusted (non-GAAP), was 41.66 , compared to 46.44 reported for the third quarter of 2023. (See Table 25 for the non-GAAP tabular reconciliation). 
 Our annualized return on average assets was 1.74 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.78 for the same period in 2023. (See Table 22 for the related non-GAAP financial measures and tabular reconciliation). Our annualized return on average common equity was 10.23 and 10.65 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. (See Table 23 for the related non-GAAP financial measures and tabular reconciliation).

 Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Our net income decreased 5.0 million, or 1.63 , to 301.7 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, from 306.7 million for the same period in 2023. On a diluted earnings per share basis, our earnings were 1.51 per share for both the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company recorded 31.4 million in credit loss expense for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, The 31.4 million of credit loss expense includes 31.7 million in provision for credit losses on loans, which was partially offset by a a 330,000 recovery of credit losses on available-for-sale investments due to an improvement in the unrealized losses for one of our subordinated debt investments. Of the 31.7 million provision for credit losses on loans recorded, 16.7 million was used to establish a hurricane reserve for loans located in the FEMA disaster areas impacted by Hurricane Helene, which made landfall during the third quarter of 2024. The hurricane related reserve had a six-cent impact to diluted earnings per share. The remaining portion of the provision was related to loan growth. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a 2.1 million gain on sale of building from our Texas region, a 2.1 million increase in the fair value of marketable securities and 162,000 in bank owned life insurance bank owned life insurance ("BOLI") death benefits, partially offset by 2.3 million of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") special assessment and a 2.0 million deferred tax asset write-down. 
 Total interest income increased by 108.2 million, or 12.5 and non-interest expense decreased by 11.0 million, or 3.2 . This was partially offset by a 100.8 million, or 41.2 increase in total interest expense. These fluctuations are primarily due to the high interest rate environment. The increase in interest income resulted from a 92.0 million, or 12.6 , increase in loan interest income and a 24.4 million, or 227.6 , increase in interest income on deposits at other banks, partially offset by an 8.2 million, or 6.4 , decrease in investment income. The decrease in non-interest expense was due to a decrease of 13.3 million, or 6.9 , in salaries and employee benefits and a decrease of 1.8 million, or 4.0 , in occupancy and equipment expense, which was partially offset by an increase of 4.3 million, or 5.4 , in other operating expenses. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to a 78.1 million, or 37.5 , increase in interest on deposits, a 22.0 million, or 104.9 , increase in interest on FHLB and other borrowed funds and a 769,000, or 23.1 , increase in interest on securities sold under agreements to repurchase. 
 Our net interest margin decreased from 4.28 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 4.23 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. The yield on interest earning assets was 6.52 and 5.95 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as average interest earning assets increased from 19.63 billion to 20.16 billion. The increase in average interest earning assets is primarily due to a 564.7 million increase in average interest-bearing balances due from banks, a 326.0 million increase in average loans receivable and a 1.1 million increase in average federal funds sold, partially offset by a 368.8 million decrease in average investment securities. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company held excess liquidity of approximately 500.0 million which was dilutive to the net interest margin by approximately 10 basis points. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized 6.5 million and 8.3 million, respectively, in total net accretion for acquired loans and deposits. The reduction in accretion was dilutive to the net interest margin by one basis point. We recognized 3.4 million in event income for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.8 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Our efficiency ratio was 42.91 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 44.76 for the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our efficiency ratio, as adjusted (non-GAAP), was 42.87 , compared to 44.86 reported for the third quarter of 2023. (See Table 25 for the non-GAAP tabular reconciliation). 
 Our annualized return on average assets was 1.77 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.84 for the same period in 2023. (See Table 22 for the related non-GAAP financial measures and tabular reconciliation). Our annualized return on average common equity was 10.53 and 11.32 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. (See Table 23 for the related non-GAAP financial measures and tabular reconciliation).

 Financial Condition as of and for the Period Ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 
 Our total assets as of September 30, 2024 increased 166.5 million to 22.82 billion from 22.66 billion reported as of December 31, 2023. Cash and cash equivalents increased 17.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our loan portfolio balance increased to 14.82 billion as of September 30, 2024 from 14.42 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase in loans was primarily due to 350.4 million of organic loan growth in our community banking footprint and 48.9 million of organic loan growth from our Centennial Commercial Finance Group ("Centennial CFG") franchise. These increases were partially offset by a 242.1 million decrease in investment securities resulting from paydowns and maturities during the first nine months of 2024.

Stockholders equity increased 168.7 million to 3.96 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to 3.79 billion as of December 31, 2023. The 168.7 million increase in stockholders equity is primarily associated with the 301.7 million in net income and 54.2 million in other comprehensive income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was partially offset by the 111.2 million of shareholder dividends paid and stock repurchases of 83.6 million.

 The 2.8 million balance of non-accrual loans for our Centennial CFG Capital Markets Group consists of two loans that are assessed for credit risk by the Federal Reserve under the Shared National Credit Program. The loans are not current on either principal or interest, and we have reversed any interest that had accrued subsequent to the non-accrual date designated by the Federal Reserve. Any interest payments that are received will be applied to the principal balance. In addition, the 22.8 million balance of foreclosed assets held for sale for our Centennial CFG Property Finance Group consists of an office building located in California. This represents the largest component of the Company's 43.0 million in foreclosed assets held for sale. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Overview. We prepare our consolidated financial statements based on the selection of certain accounting policies, generally accepted accounting principles and customary practices in the banking industry. These policies, in certain areas, require us to make significant estimates and assumptions. Our accounting policies are described in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included as part of this document. 
 We consider a policy critical if (i) the accounting estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the accounting estimate; and (ii) different estimates that could reasonably have been used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, would have a material impact on our financial statements. Using these criteria, we believe that the accounting policies most critical to us are those associated with our lending practices, including the accounting for the allowance for credit losses, foreclosed assets, investments, intangible assets, income taxes and stock options.

 Credit Losses . We account for credit losses in accordance with ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ("ASC 326" or "CECL"). The measurement of expected credit losses under the CECL methodology is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables and held-to-maturity debt securities. It also applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance (loan commitments, standby letters of credit, financial guarantees, and other similar instruments) and net investments in leases recognized by a lessor in accordance with Topic 842 on leases. 
 Investments Available-for-sale . Securities available-for-sale ("AFS") are reported at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity and other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes. Securities that are held as available-for-sale are used as a part of our asset/liability management strategy. Securities that may be sold in response to interest rate changes, changes in prepayment risk, the need to increase regulatory capital, and other similar factors are classified as available-for-sale. The Company evaluates all securities quarterly to determine if any securities in a loss position require a provision for credit losses in accordance with ASC 326. The Company first assesses whether it intends to sell or is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For securities that do not meet this criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, and changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income. The Company has made the election to exclude accrued interest receivable on AFS securities from the estimate of credit losses and report accrued interest separately on the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. 
 Investments Held-to-Maturity. Debt securities held-to-maturity ("HTM"), which include any security for which we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity, are reported at historical cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Premiums and discounts are amortized/accreted to the call date to interest income using the constant effective yield method over the estimated life of the security. The Company evaluates all securities quarterly to determine if any securities in a loss position require a provision for credit losses in accordance with ASC 326. The Company measures expected credit losses on HTM securities on a collective basis by major security type, with each type sharing similar risk characteristics. The estimate of expected credit losses considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company has made the election to exclude accrued interest receivable on HTM securities from the estimate of credit losses and report accrued interest separately on the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a security is confirmed. 
 Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses . Except for loans acquired during our acquisitions, substantially all of our loans receivable are reported at their outstanding principal balance adjusted for any charge-offs, as it is management s intent to hold them for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff, except for mortgage loans held for sale. Interest income on loans is accrued over the term of the loans based on the principal balance outstanding. 
 The allowance for credit losses on loans receivable is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. Loans are charged off against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a loan balance is confirmed and expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off. 
 Management estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, or term as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in the national unemployment rate, gross domestic product, rental vacancy rate, housing price index and rental vacancy rate index.

 The allowance for credit losses is measured based on call report segment as these types of loans exhibit similar risk characteristics. The identified loan segments are as follows: 
 1-4 family construction 
 All other construction 
 1-4 family revolving home equity lines of credit HELOC junior liens 
 1-4 family senior liens 
 Multifamily 
 Owner occupies commercial real estate 
 Non-owner occupied commercial real estate 
 Commercial industrial, agricultural, non-depository financial institutions, purchase/carry securities, other 
 Consumer auto 
 Other consumer 
 Other consumer - Shore Premier Finance ("SPF") 
 The allowance for credit losses for each segment is measured through the use of the discounted cash flow method ("DCF"). Loans evaluated individually that are considered to be collateral dependent are not included in the collective evaluation. For these loans, where the Company has determined that foreclosure of the collateral is probable, or where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and the Company expects repayment of the loan to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, the allowance for credit losses is measured based on the difference between the fair value of the collateral, net of estimated costs to sell, and the amortized cost basis of the loan as of the measurement date. When repayment is expected to be from the operation of the collateral, expected credit losses are calculated as the amount by which the amortized cost basis of the loan exceeds the present value of expected cash flows from the operation of the collateral. The allowance for credit losses may be zero if the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date exceeds the amortized cost basis of the loan, net of estimated costs to sell. For individually analyzed loans which are not considered to be collateral dependent, an allowance is recorded based on the loss rate for the respective pool within the collective evaluation. 
 Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals, and modifications unless either of the following applies: 
 Management has a reasonable expectation at the reporting date that restructured loans made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty will be executed with an individual borrower. 
 The extension or renewal options are included in the original or modified contract at the reporting date and are not unconditionally cancellable by the Company. 
 Management qualitatively adjusts model results for risk factors that are not considered within our modeling processes but are nonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within our loan pools. These qualitative factors ("Q-Factors") and other qualitative adjustments may increase or decrease management's estimate of expected credit losses by a calculated percentage or amount based upon the estimated level of risk. The various risks that may be considered in making Q-Factor and other qualitative adjustments include, among other things, the impact of (i) changes in lending policies, procedures and strategies; (ii) changes in nature and volume of the portfolio; (iii) staff experience; (iv) changes in volume and trends in classified loans, delinquencies and nonaccruals; (v) concentration risk; (vi) trends in underlying collateral values; (vii) external factors such as competition, legal and regulatory environment; (viii) changes in the quality of the loan review system; and (ix) economic conditions. 
 Loans are placed on non-accrual status when management believes that the borrower s financial condition, after giving consideration to economic and business conditions and collection efforts, is such that collection of interest is doubtful, or generally when loans are 90 days or more past due. Loans are charged against the allowance for credit losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. Accrued interest related to non-accrual loans is generally charged against the allowance for credit losses when accrued in prior years and reversed from interest income if accrued in the current year. Interest income on non-accrual loans may be recognized to the extent cash payments are received, although the majority of payments received are usually applied to principal. Non-accrual loans are generally returned to accrual status when principal and interest payments are less than 90 days past due, the customer has made required payments for at least six months, and we reasonably expect to collect all principal and interest.

 The Company has purchased loans, some of which have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination. Purchase credit deteriorated PCD loans are recorded at the amount paid. An allowance for credit losses is determined using the same methodology as other loans. The initial allowance for credit losses determined on a collective basis is allocated to individual loans. The sum of the loan s purchase price and allowance for credit losses becomes its initial amortized cost basis. The difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a noncredit discount or premium, which is amortized into interest income over the life of the loan. Subsequent changes to the allowance for credit losses are recorded through the provision for credit loss. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses on Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures. The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for or reversal of credit loss expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life. 
 Foreclosed Assets Held for Sale . Real estate and personal property acquired through or in lieu of loan foreclosure are to be sold and are initially recorded at fair value at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Valuations are periodically performed by management, and the real estate and personal property are carried at fair value less costs to sell. Gains and losses from the sale of other real estate and personal property are recorded in non-interest income, and expenses used to maintain the properties are included in non-interest expenses. 
 Intangible Assets . Intangible assets consist of goodwill and core deposit intangibles. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business acquisitions. The core deposit intangible represents the excess intangible value of acquired deposit customer relationships as determined by valuation specialists. The core deposit intangibles are being amortized over 48 months to 121 months on a straight-line basis. Goodwill is not amortized but rather is evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis. We perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and core deposit intangibles as required by FASB ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other , in the fourth quarter or more often if events and circumstances indicate there may be an impairment. 
 Income Taxes . We account for income taxes in accordance with income tax accounting guidance (ASC 740, Income Taxes ). The income tax accounting guidance results in two components of income tax expense: current and deferred. Current income tax expense reflects taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period by applying the provisions of the enacted tax law to the taxable income or excess of deductions over revenues. We determine deferred income taxes using the liability (or balance sheet) method. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and enacted changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which they occur. 
 Deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the tax position will be realized or sustained upon examination. The term more likely than not means a likelihood of more than 50 percent; the terms examined and upon examination also include resolution of the related appeals or litigation processes, if any. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The determination of whether or not a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold considers the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date and is subject to the management s judgment. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of evidence available, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. 
 Both we and our subsidiary file consolidated tax returns. Our subsidiary provides for income taxes on a separate return basis, and remits to us amounts determined to be currently payable. 
 Stock Compensation . In accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation , and FASB ASC 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees , the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant. We recognize compensation expense for the grant-date fair value of the option award over the vesting period of the award.

 Results of Operations 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Our net income increased 1.6 million, or 1.6 , to 100.0 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, from 98.5 million for the same period in 2023. On a diluted earnings per share basis, our earnings were 0.50 per share for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.49 per share for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. The Company recorded 18.9 million in credit loss expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The 18.9 million of credit loss expense includes 18.2 million in provision for credit losses on loans. Of the 18.2 million provision for credit losses on loans recorded, 16.7 million was used to establish a hurricane reserve for loans located in the FEMA disaster areas impacted by Hurricane Helene, which made landfall during the quarter. The hurricane related reserve had a six-cent impact to diluted earnings per share for the quarter. The remaining portion of the provision was related to loan growth. The Company also recorded a 1.0 million provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments, and we recorded a 330,000 recovery of credit losses on available-for-sale investments due to an improvement in the unrealized losses for one of our subordinated debt investments. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a 1.4 million increase in the fair value of marketable securities. 
 Our net income decreased 5.0 million, or 1.63 , to 301.7 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, from 306.7 million for the same period in 2023. On a diluted earnings per share basis, our earnings were 1.51 per share for both the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company recorded 31.4 million in credit loss expense for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, The 31.4 million of credit loss expense includes 31.7 million in provision for credit losses on loans, which was partially offset by a a 330,000 recovery of credit losses on available-for-sale investments due to an improvement in the unrealized losses for one of our subordinated debt investments. Of the 31.7 million provision for credit losses on loans recorded, 16.7 million was used to establish a hurricane reserve for loans located in the FEMA disaster areas impacted by Hurricane Helene, which made landfall during the third quarter of 2024. The hurricane related reserve had a six-cent impact to diluted earnings per share. The remaining portion of the provision was related to loan growth. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a 2.1 million gain on sale of building from our Texas region, a 2.1 million increase in the fair value of marketable securities and 162,000 in bank owned life insurance BOLI death benefits, partially offset by 2.3 million of FDIC special assessment and a 2.0 million deferred tax asset write-down. 
 
 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income, our principal source of earnings, is the difference between the interest income generated by earning assets and the total interest cost of the deposits and borrowings obtained to fund those assets. Factors affecting the level of net interest income include the volume of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, yields earned on loans and investments, rates paid on deposits and other borrowings, the level of non-performing loans and the amount of non-interest-bearing liabilities supporting earning assets. Net interest income is analyzed in the discussion and tables below on a fully taxable equivalent basis. The adjustment to convert certain income to a fully taxable equivalent basis consists of dividing tax-exempt income by one minus the combined federal and state income tax rate (24.989 for 2024 and 24.6735 for 2023).

 The Federal Reserve Board sets various benchmark rates, including the Federal Funds rate, and thereby influences the general market rates of interest, including the deposit and loan rates offered by financial institutions. The Federal Reserve increased the target rate four times during 2023. First, on February 1, 2023, the target rate was increased to 4.50 to 4.75 , second, on March 22, 2023, the target rate was increased to 4.75 to 5.00 , third, on May 3, 2023, the target rate was increased to 5.00 to 5.25 and fourth, on July 26, 2023, the target rate was increased to 5.25 to 5.50 . On September 18, 2024, the Federal Reserve reduced the target rate to 4.75 to 5.00 . 
 Our net interest margin increased from 4.19 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 4.28 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. The yield on interest earning assets was 6.60 and 6.09 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and average interest earning assets increased from 19.26 billion to 20.23 billion. The increase in average interest earning assets is primarily due to a 706.1 million increase in average interest-bearing balances due from banks and a 571.2 million increase in average loans receivable, partially offset by a 315.8 million decrease in average investment securities. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company held excess liquidity of approximately 500.0 million which was dilutive to the net interest margin by 10 basis points. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized 1.9 million and 2.4 million, respectively, in total net accretion for acquired loans and deposits. The reduction in accretion was dilutive to the net interest margin by two basis points. We recognized 573,000 in event income for the three-months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 521,000 for the three-months ended September 30, 2023. The remaining increase in the net interest margin was due to an increase in interest income resulting from an increase in average interest-bearing assets at higher interest rates primarily as a result of the high interest rate environment. 
 Our net interest margin decreased from 4.28 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 4.23 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. The yield on interest earning assets was 6.52 and 5.95 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as average interest earning assets increased from 19.63 billion to 20.16 billion. The increase in average interest earning assets is primarily due to a 564.7 million increase in average interest-bearing balances due from banks, a 326.0 million increase in average loans receivable and a 1.1 million increase in average federal funds sold, partially offset by a 368.8 million decrease in average investment securities. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company held excess liquidity of approximately 500.0 million which was dilutive to the net interest margin by 10 basis points. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized 6.5 million and 8.3 million, respectively, in total net accretion for acquired loans and deposits. The reduction in accretion was dilutive to the net interest margin by one basis point. We recognized 3.4 million in event income for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.8 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased 14.6 million, or 7.2 , to 217.8 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, from 203.2 million for the same period in 2023. This increase in net interest income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was the result of a 39.9 million increase in interest income, which was partially offset by a 25.3 million increase in interest expense, on a fully taxable equivalent basis. The 39.9 million increase in interest income was primarily the result of the high interest rate environment. The higher yield on earning assets resulted in an increase in interest income of approximately 22.9 million, in addition to an increase of 17.0 million in interest income due to the change in average interest earning asset balances. The 25.3 million increase in interest expense is also primarily the result of the high interest rate environment. The higher rates on interest bearing liabilities resulted in an increase in interest expense of approximately 14.2 million, in addition to an increase in average interest bearing liabilities which increased interest expense by approximately 11.1 million. 
 Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased 9.2 million, or 1.5 , to 637.8 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, from 628.6 million for the same period in 2023. This increase in net interest income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was the result of a 110.0 million increase in interest income, which was partially offset by a 100.8 million increase in interest expense, on a fully taxable equivalent basis. The 110.0 million increase in interest income was primarily the result of the high interest rate environment. The higher yield on earning assets resulted in an increase in interest income of approximately 80.6 million, in addition to an increase of 29.4 million in interest income due to the change in average interest earning asset balances. The 100.8 million increase in interest expense is also primarily the result of the high interest rate environment. The higher rates on interest bearing liabilities resulted in an increase in interest expense of approximately 70.6 million, in addition to an increase in average interest bearing liabilities which increased interest expense by approximately 30.2 million.

 Provision for Credit Losses 
 Credit Loss Expense : During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded 18.9 million in credit loss expense. The 18.9 million of credit loss expense includes 18.2 million in provision for credit losses on loans. Of the 18.2 million provision for credit losses on loans recorded, 16.7 million was used to establish a hurricane reserve for loans located in the FEMA disaster areas impacted by Hurricane Helene, which made landfall during the quarter. The hurricane related reserve had a six-cent impact to diluted earnings per share for the quarter. The remaining portion of the provision was related to loan growth. The Company also recorded a 1.0 million provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments and recorded a 330,000 recovery of credit losses on available-for-sale investments due to an improvement in the unrealized losses for one of our subordinated debt investments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded 31.4 million in credit loss expense. The 31.4 million of credit loss expense includes 31.7 million in provision for credit losses on loans, which as partially offset by the 330,000 recovery of credit losses on available-for-sale investments due to an improvement in the unrealized losses for one of our subordinated debt investments. Of the 31.7 million provision for credit losses on loans recorded, 16.7 million was used to establish a hurricane reserve for loans. The remaining portion of the provision was related to loan growth. For both the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, the Company determined the 2.0 million allowance for credit losses on the held-to-maturity portfolio was adequate. Therefore, no additional provision was considered necessary for the HTM portfolio. 
 Net charge-offs to average total loans was 0.04 and 0.08 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and net charge-offs to average total loans was 0.07 and 0.10 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 Non-interest income decreased 634,000, or 1.5 , to 42.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 43.4 million for the same period in 2023. The primary factor that resulted in this decrease was the decreases in fair value adjustment for marketable securities, which was partially offset by increases in other service charges and fees, mortgage lending income and other income. 
 Additional details for the three months ended September 30, 2024 on some of the more significant changes are as follows: 
 The 362,000 increase in other service charges and fees is primarily related to an increase in Centennial CFG property finance loan fees. 
 The 1.3 million increase in mortgage lending income is primarily related to an increase in volume of secondary market loans from the lower volume of loans during 2023. 
 The 3.1 million decrease in the fair value adjustment for marketable securities is due to the changes in the fair value of marketable securities held by the Company. 
 The 1.3 million increase in other income is primarily due to a 737,000 increase in rental income from other real estate owned ("OREO"), a 230,000 increase in investment brokerage fee income and a 705,000 increase in recoveries on historic losses, partially offset by a 338,000 reduction in BOLI death benefit income. 
 Non-interest income increased 266,000, or 0.2 , to 127.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 127.1 million for the same period in 2023. The primary factors that resulted in this increase were the increases in fair value adjustment for marketable securities, trust fees, mortgage lending income and the gain on sale of branches, equipment and other assets, net, which was partially offset by decreases in other service charges and fees and other income.

 The 485,000 decrease in advertising expense is primarily due to a decreased volume of advertising. 
 The 382,000 decrease in amortization of intangibles is due to the core deposit intangible ("CDI") from the acquisition of Liberty Bank being fully amortized in 2023. 
 The 566,000 increase in FDIC and state assessment expense is primarily due to a true-up which was recorded in September 2023 as a result of an FDIC assessment rate reduction. 
 The 388,000 increase in legal and accounting expense is primarily due to ongoing legal matters. 
 The 2.2 million increase in other expense is primarily due to increases in OREO expense. 
 Non-interest expense decreased 11.0 million, or 3.2 , to 334.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 345.7 million for the same period in 2023. The primary factors that resulted in this decrease were the decrease in salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expense, advertising expense, amortization of intangibles, electronic banking expense and other professional fees, which were partially offset by an increase in FDIC and state assessment, legal and accounting expense and other expense. 
 Additional details for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 on some of the more significant changes are as follows:

 Financial Condition as of and for the Period Ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 
 Our total assets as of September 30, 2024 increased 166.5 million to 22.82 billion from 22.66 billion reported as of December 31, 2023.

Our loan portfolio balance increased to 14.82 billion as of September 30, 2024 from 14.42 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase in loans was primarily due to 350.4 million of organic loan growth in our community banking footprint and 48.9 million of organic loan growth from our Centennial CFG franchise. These increases were partially offset by a 242.1 million decrease in investment securities resulting from paydowns and maturities during the first nine months of 2024. Total deposits decreased 82.0 million to 16.71 billion as of September 30, 2024 from 16.79 billion as of December 31, 2023.

 Loan Portfolio 
 Loans Receivable 
 Our loan portfolio averaged 14.76 billion and 14.19 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our loan portfolio averaged 14.63 billion and 14.31 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Loans receivable were 14.82 billion and 14.42 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 From December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, the Company experienced an increase of approximately 399.3 million in loans. The increase in loans was primarily due to 350.4 million of organic loan growth in our community banking footprint and 48.9 million of organic loan growth from our Centennial CFG franchise. 
 The most significant components of the loan portfolio were commercial real estate, residential real estate, consumer and commercial and industrial loans. These loans are generally secured by residential or commercial real estate or business or personal property. Although these loans are primarily originated within our franchises in Arkansas, Florida, Texas, Alabama and Centennial CFG, the property securing these loans may not physically be located within our market areas of Arkansas, Florida, Texas, Alabama and New York. Loans receivable were approximately 3.38 billion, 4.10 billion, 3.90 billion, 115.8 million, 1.32 billion and 2.00 billion as of September 30, 2024 in Arkansas, Florida, Texas, Alabama, SPF and Centennial CFG, respectively.

 Commercial Real Estate Loans. We originate non-farm and non-residential loans (primarily secured by commercial real estate), construction/land development loans, and agricultural loans, which are generally secured by real estate located in our market areas. Our commercial mortgage loans are generally collateralized by first liens on real estate and amortized (where defined) over a 15 to 30-year period with balloon payments due at the end of one to five years. These loans are generally underwritten by assessing cash flow (debt service coverage), primary and secondary source of repayment, the financial strength of any guarantor, the strength of the tenant (if any), the borrower s liquidity and leverage, management experience, ownership structure, economic conditions and industry specific trends and collateral. Generally, we will loan up to 85 of the value of improved property, 65 of the value of raw land and 75 of the value of land to be acquired and developed. A first lien on the property and assignment of lease is required if the collateral is rental property, with second lien positions considered on a case-by-case basis. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 1.13 billion of construction/land development loans which were collateralized by land. This consisted of approximately 104.8 million for raw land and approximately 1.02 billion for land with commercial and/or residential lots. 
 As of September 30, 2024, commercial real estate ("CRE") loans totaled 8.57 billion, or 57.8 , of loans receivable, as compared to 8.17 billion, or 56.7 , of loans receivable, as of December 31, 2023. CRE loans originated in our Arkansas, Florida, Texas, Alabama, SPF and Centennial CFG markets were 2.18 billion, 2.57 billion, 2.19 billion, 46.7 million, zero and 1.59 billion at September 30, 2024, respectively.

 (2) Excludes multi-family residential loans of 482.6 million and 435.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which are included in the residential real estate loans throughout the filing. Multi-family residential loans are included in CRE for regulatory purposes. 
 Our loan policy states that in order to achieve a well-balanced, diversified credit portfolio, concentrations containing inappropriate or excessive risk are to be avoided. It is the goal of the Company to maintain a prudent diversification of loans. We define a concentration of credit as direct or indirect obligations according to the following guidelines: (i) concentrations of 25 or more of total risk-based capital by individual borrower, small, interrelated group of individuals, single repayment source or individual project; (ii) concentrations of 100 or more of total risk-based capital by industry or product line. As of September 30, 2024, we have not met the threshold for the concentration limits. In addition, the Bank's Board of Directors monitors the CRE loan portfolio for concentrations related to geography, industry, and collateral type and determines applicable guidelines. The Chief Lending Officer also reviews the portfolio periodically to determine if any concentrations exist and makes recommendations with respect to setting internal guidelines. 
 The Company also monitors key risk indicators ("KRIs") on a quarterly basis for the overall loan portfolio as well as specific KRIs for the CRE portfolio. The KRIs are tied to the Bank's appetite for credit risk which is reflected in the Bank's credit policy and underwriting criteria. The KRIs related to underwriting include loan downgrades by loan review, loan downgrades to classified levels and loan policy exceptions (loan to value, debt coverage ratio and credit score). The KRIs related to CRE loans include concentrations of construction and land loans, concentrations of total CRE loans, CRE loans in excess of loan to value guidelines and total real estate loans in excess of loan to value guidelines. The results of the KRI analysis are presented to the Bank's Asset Quality Committee on a quarterly basis. Any exceptions to established limits and thresholds are monitored and addressed in a timely manner as required by the Asset Quality Committee. 
 The Company has a CRE strategy and contingency plan which outlines the principles required to adequately manage our CRE exposures. It discusses the inherent risks within CRE lending, as well as the risks unique to specific lending activities and property taxes. In addition, the plan outlines internal limits related to CRE lending, reasoning for operating outside those limits, and provides for a contingency plan to reduce the CRE exposures under adverse economic conditions or other situations where it is deemed necessary to do so. The responsibility for monitoring the CRE Strategy and Contingency Plan, and subsequent reporting to Management and the Board of Directors lies with the Chief Lending Officer and the Asset Quality Committee of the Board of Directors. Within the CRE Strategy and Contingency Plan, we established four adverse economic triggers to measure on an ongoing basis to attempt to determine when a change in CRE strategy might be warranted, at least from an external economic perspective. If one or a combination of these triggers have exceeded Board approved thresholds, the Executive Risk Committee will determine which action or combination of actions to take based on the specific situation. The required actions are likely to focus on tightening/loosening of underwriting criteria, potential capital raises or loan distribution actions such as selling or participating loans. However, other action steps may be considered necessary depending upon the specific situation. As of September 30, 2024, the leading economic indicator trigger exceeded our internal guidelines, but we have not recommended any additional changes to our underwriting standards because the Company considers the current standards to be adequate in addressing the risks to our CRE portfolio. 
 Residential Real Estate Loans. We originate one to four family, residential mortgage loans generally secured by property located in our primary market areas. Approximately 55.8 and 37.5 of our residential mortgage loans consist of owner occupied 1-4 family properties and non-owner occupied 1-4 family properties (rental), respectively, as of September 30, 2024, with the remaining 6.7 relating to condominiums and mobile homes. Residential real estate loans generally have a loan-to-value ratio of up to 90 . These loans are underwritten by giving consideration to the borrower s ability to pay, stability of employment or source of income, debt-to-income ratio, credit history and loan-to-value ratio. 
 As of September 30, 2024, residential real estate loans totaled 2.42 billion, or 16.3 , of loans receivable, compared to 2.28 billion, or 15.8 , of loans receivable, as of December 31, 2023. Residential real estate loans originated in our Arkansas, Florida, Texas, Alabama, SPF and Centennial CFG markets were 572.2 million, 1.03 billion, 621.0 million, 37.9 million, zero and 149.8 million at September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Consumer Loans. Our consumer loans are composed of secured and unsecured loans originated by our bank, the primary portion of which consists of loans to finance United States Coast Guard registered high-end sail and power boats within our SPF division. The performance of consumer loans will be affected by the local and regional economies as well as the rates of personal bankruptcies, job loss, divorce and other individual-specific characteristics. 
 As of September 30, 2024, consumer loans totaled 1.22 billion, or 8.2 , of loans receivable, compared to 1.15 billion, or 8.0 , of loans receivable, as of December 31, 2023. Consumer loans originated in our Arkansas, Florida, Texas, Alabama, SPF and Centennial CFG markets were 23.0 million, 7.0 million, 11.8 million, 454,000, 1.18 billion and zero at September 30, 2024, respectively.

 Commercial and Industrial Loans. Commercial and industrial loans are made for a variety of business purposes, including working capital, inventory, equipment and capital expansion. The terms for commercial loans are generally one to seven years. Commercial loan applications must be supported by current financial information of the borrower and, where appropriate, by adequate collateral. Commercial loans are generally underwritten by addressing cash flow (debt service coverage), primary and secondary sources of repayment, the financial strength of any guarantor, the borrower s liquidity and leverage, management experience, ownership structure, economic conditions and industry specific trends and collateral. The loan to value ratio depends on the type of collateral. Generally, accounts receivable are financed at between 50 and 80 of accounts receivable less than 60 days past due. Inventory financing will range between 50 and 80 (with no work in process) depending on the borrower and nature of inventory. We require a first lien position for those loans. 
 As of September 30, 2024, commercial and industrial loans totaled 2.08 billion, or 14.1 , of loans receivable, compared to 2.32 billion, or 16.1 , of loans receivable, as of December 31, 2023. Commercial and industrial loans originated in our Arkansas, Florida, Texas, Alabama, SPF and Centennial CFG markets were 416.1 million, 448.5 million, 821.4 million, 25.2 million, 143.2 million and 230.2 million at September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 
 Non-Performing Assets 
 We classify our problem loans into three categories: past due loans, special mention loans and classified loans (accruing and non-accruing). 
 When management determines that a loan is no longer performing, and that collection of interest appears doubtful, the loan is placed on non-accrual status. Loans that are 90 days past due are placed on non-accrual status unless they are adequately secured and there is reasonable assurance of full collection of both principal and interest. Our management closely monitors all loans that are contractually 90 days past due, treated as special mention or otherwise classified or on non-accrual status. 
 Purchased loans that have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination are PCD loans. An allowance for credit losses is determined using the same methodology as other loans. The Company develops separate PCD models for each loan segment with PCD loans not individually analyzed for credit losses. The sum of the loan s purchase price and allowance for credit losses becomes its initial amortized cost basis. The difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a non-credit discount or premium, which is amortized into interest income over the life of the loan. Subsequent changes to the allowance for credit losses are recorded through the provision for credit losses. The Company held approximately 79.6 million and 130.7 million in PCD loans, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Table 11 sets forth information with respect to our non-performing assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As of these dates, all non-performing restructured loans are included in non-accrual loans.

 Our non-performing loans are comprised of non-accrual loans and accruing loans that are contractually past due 90 days. Our bank subsidiary recognizes income principally on the accrual basis of accounting. When loans are classified as non-accrual, the accrued interest is charged off and no further interest is accrued, unless the credit characteristics of the loan improve. If a loan is determined by management to be uncollectible, the portion of the loan determined to be uncollectible is then charged to the allowance for credit losses. 
 Total non-performing loans were 101.1 million and 64.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Non-performing loans at September 30, 2024 were 30.4 million, 40.8 million, 20.0 million, 391,000, 6.8 million and 2.8 million in the Arkansas, Florida, Texas, Alabama, SPF and Centennial CFG markets, respectively. 
 The 2.8 million balance of non-accrual loans for our Centennial CFG Capital Markets Group consists of two loans that are assessed for credit risk by the Federal Reserve under the Shared National Credit Program. The loans are not current on either principal or interest, and we have reversed any interest that had accrued subsequent to the non-accrual date designated by the Federal Reserve. Any interest payments that are received will be applied to the principal balance. In addition, the 22.8 million balance of foreclosed assets held for sale for our Centennial CFG Property Finance Group consists of an office building located in California. This represents the largest component of the Company's 43.0 million in foreclosed assets held for sale. 
 Debt restructuring generally occurs when a borrower is experiencing, or is expected to experience, financial difficulties in the near term. As a result, we will work with the borrower to prevent further difficulties, and ultimately to improve the likelihood of recovery on the loan. In those circumstances it may be beneficial to restructure the terms of a loan and work with the borrower for the benefit of both parties, versus forcing the property into foreclosure and having to dispose of it in potentially an unfavorable and depressed real estate market. When we have modified the terms of a loan, we usually either reduce the monthly payment and/or interest rate for generally about three to twelve months. For our restructured loans that accrue interest at the time the loan is restructured, it would be a rare exception to have charged-off any portion of the loan. As of September 30, 2024, we had 6.5 million of restructured loans that are in compliance with the modified terms and are not reported as past due or non-accrual, and we had 17.7 million of restructured loans that are not in compliance with the modified terms and are reported as non-accrual. Of the 6.5 million of restructured loans that are in compliance with the modified terms, our Arkansas market contained 1.5 million, our Florida market contained 1.2 million, our Texas market contained 1.5 million and our New York region contained 2.2 million of these restructured loans. Of the 17.7 million of restructured loans not in compliance with the modified terms, our Arkansas market contained 1.3 million, our Florida market contained 16.0 million and our Texas market contained 425,000. 
 A loan modification that might not otherwise be considered may be granted. These loans can involve loans remaining on non-accrual, moving to non-accrual, or continuing on an accrual status, depending on the individual facts and circumstances of the borrower. Generally, a non-accrual loan that is restructured remains on non-accrual for a period of nine months to demonstrate that the borrower can meet the restructured terms. However, performance prior to the restructuring, or significant events that coincide with the restructuring, are considered in assessing whether the borrower can pay under the new terms and may result in the loan being returned to an accrual status after a shorter performance period. If the borrower s ability to meet the revised payment schedule is not reasonably assured, the loan will remain in a non-accrual status. 
 The majority of the Bank s restructured loans relate to real estate lending and generally involve reducing the interest rate, changing from a principal and interest payment to interest-only, lengthening the amortization period, or a combination of some or all of the three. In addition, it is common for the Bank to seek additional collateral or guarantor support when modifying a loan. At September 30, 2024, the amount of restructured loans was 24.2 million. As of September 30, 2024, 26.8 of all restructured loans were performing to the terms of the restructure. 
 
 Total foreclosed assets held for sale were 43.0 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 30.5 million as of December 31, 2023, for an increase of 12.6 million. The foreclosed assets held for sale as of September 30, 2024 are comprised of 21,000 located in Arkansas, 7.3 million located in Florida, 13.0 million located in Texas, zero in Alabama, zero in SPF and 22.8 million in Centennial CFG. The majority of the foreclosed assets held for sale is comprised of three properties. The first is an office building located in Santa Monica, California with a carrying value of 22.8 million. The second is an apartment complex which is under construction in Gunter, Texas with a carrying value of 12.8 million, and the third is an office building located in Miami, Florida with a carrying value of 7.0 million. These three properties account for 42.6 million of the balance of foreclosed assets held for sale at September 30, 2024.

 If non-accrual loans had been accruing interest in accordance with the original terms of their respective agreements, interest income of approximately 1.5 million and 1.9 million, respectively, would have been recorded for both of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. If non-accrual loans had been accruing interest in accordance with the original terms of their respective agreements, interest income of approximately 4.5 million and 5.5 million, respectively, would have been recorded for both of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The interest income recognized on non-accrual loans for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was considered immaterial.

 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 Overview. The allowance for credit losses on loans receivable increased from 288.2 million as of December 31, 2023 to 312.6 million as of September 30, 2024. The specific reserve for loans individually analyzed for credit losses was 20.4 million on 206.8 million of individually analyzed loans as of September 30, 2024, compared to a reserve of 6.4 million on 171.7 million of individually analyzed loans as of December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans was 2.11 and 2.00 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Loans Collectively Evaluated for Credit Loss. Loans receivable collectively evaluated for credit loss increased by approximately 364.1 million from 14.25 billion at December 31, 2023 to 14.62 billion at September 30, 2024. The percentage of the allowance for credit losses allocated to loans receivable collectively evaluated for credit loss to the total loans collectively evaluated for credit loss was 2.00 and 1.98 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Charge-offs and Recoveries. Total charge-offs decreased to 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.4 million for the same period in 2023. Total charge-offs decreased to 9.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 12.5 million for the same period in 2023. Total recoveries were 519,000 and 528,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Total recoveries were 1.7 million and 2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net charge-offs were 538,000 for Arkansas, 310,000 for Florida, 503,000 for Texas, 4,000 for Alabama, 127,000 for SPF and zero for Centennial CFG. These equal a net charge-off position of 1.5 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net charge-offs were 3.1 million for Arkansas, 835,000 for Florida, 2.9 million for Texas, 23,000 for Alabama, 287,000 for SPF and 222,000 for Centennial CFG. These equal a net charge-off position of 7.4 million. 
 We have not charged off an amount less than what was determined to be the fair value of the collateral as presented in the appraisal, less estimated costs to sell (for collateral dependent loans), for any period presented. Loans partially charged-off are placed on non-accrual status until it is proven that the borrower's repayment ability with respect to the remaining principal balance can be reasonably assured. This is usually established over a period of 6-12 months of timely payment performance.

 Investment Securities 
 Our securities portfolio is the second largest component of earning assets and provides a significant source of revenue. Securities within the portfolio are classified as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, or trading based on the intent and objective of the investment and the ability to hold to maturity. Fair values of securities are based on quoted market prices where available. If quoted market prices are not available, estimated fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable securities. The estimated effective duration of our securities portfolio was 4.6 years as of September 30, 2024. 
 Securities held-to-maturity, which include any security for which we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity, are reported at historical cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Premiums and discounts are amortized/accreted to the call date to interest income using the constant effective yield method over the estimated life of the security. We had 1.28 billion of held-to-maturity securities at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 At September 30, 2024, 1.11 billion, or 86.7 , was invested in obligations of state and political subdivisions, compared to 1.11 billion, or 86.5 , as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, 43.5 million, or 3.4 , was invested in obligations of U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises, compared to 43.3 million, or 3.4 , as of December 31, 2023. We had 125.9 million, or 9.9 , invested in U.S. government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities at September 30, 2024, compared to 130.3 million, or 10.2 , at December 31, 2023. 
 Securities available-for-sale are reported at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity as other comprehensive (loss) income. Securities that may be sold in response to interest rate changes, changes in prepayment risk, the need to increase regulatory capital, and other similar factors are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities were 3.27 billion and 3.51 billion as September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Table of Contents 

 As of September 30, 2024, 1.43 billion, or 43.6 , of our available-for-sale securities were invested in U.S. government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities, compared to 1.52 billion, or 43.3 , of our available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2023. To reduce our income tax burden, 900.9 million, or 27.5 , of our available-for-sale securities portfolio as of September 30, 2024, were primarily invested in tax-exempt obligations of state and political subdivisions, compared to 916.3 million, or 26.1 , of our available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2023. We had 311.8 million, or 9.5 , invested in obligations of U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises as of September 30, 2024, compared to 346.6 million, or 9.9 , of our available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2023. We had 262.2 million, or 8.0 , invested in non-government-sponsored asset backed securities as of September 30, 2024, compared to 363.5 million, or 10.4 , of our available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, 177.9 million, or 5.4 , of our available-for-sale securities were invested in private mortgage-backed securities, compared to 175.4 million, or 5.0 , of our available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2023. Also, we had approximately 192.3 million, or 5.9 , invested in other securities as of September 30, 2024, compared to 185.6 million, or 5.3 of our available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2023. 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company recovered 330,000 in AFS reserves due to an improvement in the unrealized loss position of one of the Company's subordinated debt investments. For both the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, the Company determined the 2.0 million allowance for credit losses on the held-to-maturity portfolio was adequate. Therefore, no additional provision was considered necessary for the HTM portfolio. 
 See Note 3 to the Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the carrying value and fair value of investment securities. 
 
 Deposits 
 Our deposits averaged 16.86 billion and 16.85 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Our deposits averaged 16.68 billion and 17.17 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Total deposits were 16.71 billion as of September 30, 2024, and 16.79 billion as of December 31, 2023. Deposits are our primary source of funds. We offer a variety of products designed to attract and retain deposit customers. Those products consist of checking accounts, regular savings deposits, NOW accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. Deposits are gathered from individuals, partnerships and corporations in our market areas. In addition, we obtain deposits from state and local entities and, to a lesser extent, U.S. Government and other depository institutions. 
 Our policy also permits the acceptance of brokered deposits. From time to time, when appropriate in order to fund strong loan demand, we accept brokered time deposits, generally in denominations of less than 250,000, from a regional brokerage firm, and other national brokerage networks. We also participate in the One-Way Buy Insured Cash Sweep ICS service and similar services, which provide for one-way buy transactions among banks for the purpose of purchasing cost-effective floating-rate funding without collateralization or stock purchase requirements. Management believes these sources represent a reliable and cost-efficient alternative funding source for the Company. However, to the extent that our condition or reputation deteriorates, or to the extent that there are significant changes in market interest rates which we do not elect to match, we may experience an outflow of brokered deposits. In that event we would be required to obtain alternate sources for funding. 
 Table 17 reflects the classification of the brokered deposits as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 The interest rates paid are competitively priced for each particular deposit product and structured to meet our funding requirements. We will continue to manage interest expense through deposit pricing. We may allow higher rate deposits to run off during periods of limited loan demand. We believe that additional funds can be attracted, and deposit growth can be realized through deposit pricing if we experience increased loan demand or other liquidity needs.

 The Federal Reserve Board sets various benchmark rates, including the Federal Funds rate, and thereby influences the general market rates of interest, including the deposit and loan rates offered by financial institutions. The Federal Reserve increased the target rate four times during 2023. First, on February 1, 2023, the target rate was increased to 4.50 to 4.75 , second, on March 22, 2023, the target rate was increased to 4.75 to 5.00 , third, on May 3, 2023, the target rate was increased to 5.00 to 5.25 and fourth, on July 26, 2023, the target rate was increased to 5.25 to 5.50 . On September 18, 2024, the Federal Reserve reduced the target rate to 4.75 to 5.00 .

 Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase 
 We enter into short-term purchases of securities under agreements to resell (resale agreements) and sales of securities under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements) of substantially identical securities. The amounts advanced under resale agreements and the amounts borrowed under repurchase agreements are carried on the balance sheet at the amount advanced. Interest incurred on repurchase agreements is reported as interest expense. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased 37.3 million, or 26.3 , from 142.1 million as of December 31, 2023 to 179.4 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 FHLB and Other Borrowed Funds 
 The Company s FHLB borrowed funds, which are secured by our loan portfolio, were 600.0 million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the entire 600.0 million of the outstanding balances were classified as long-term advances. The FHLB advances mature from 2025 to 2037 with fixed interest rates ranging from 3.37 to 4.84 . Expected maturities could differ from contractual maturities because FHLB may have the right to call, or the Company may have the right to prepay certain obligations.

 Other borrowed funds were 700.8 million as of September 30, 2024 and were classified as short-term advances. The Company had 701.3 million in other borrowed funds as of December 31, 2023. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had drawn 700.0 million from the Bank Term Funding Program in the ordinary course of business, and these advances mature on January 16, 2025. 
 Additionally, the Company had 1.24 billion and 1.33 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, in letters of credit under a FHLB blanket borrowing line of credit, which are used to collateralize public deposits. 
 Subordinated Debentures 
 Subordinated debentures were 439.4 million and 439.8 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 On April 1, 2022, the Company acquired 140.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.500 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2030 (the 2030 Notes from Happy, and the Company recorded approximately 144.4 million which included fair value adjustments. The 2030 Notes are unsecured, subordinated debt obligations of the Company and will mature on July 31, 2030. From and including the date of issuance to, but excluding July 31, 2025 or the date of earlier redemption, the 2030 Notes will bear interest at an initial rate of 5.50 per annum, payable in arrears on January 31 and July 31 of each year. From and including July 31, 2025 to, but excluding, the maturity date or earlier redemption, the 2030 Notes will bear interest at a floating rate equal to the Benchmark rate (which is expected to be 3-month Secured Overnight Funding Rate (SOFR)), each as defined in and subject to the provisions of the applicable supplemental indenture for the 2030 Notes, plus 5.345 , payable quarterly in arrears on January 31, April 30, July 31, and October 31 of each year, commencing on October 31, 2025. 
 
 The Company may, beginning with the interest payment date of July 31, 2025, and on any interest payment date thereafter, redeem the 2030 Notes, in whole or in part, subject to prior approval of the Federal Reserve if then required, at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the 2030 Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date of redemption. The Company may also redeem the 2030 Notes at any time, including prior to July 31, 2025, at the Company s option, in whole but not in part, subject to prior approval of the Federal Reserve if then required, if certain events occur that could impact the Company s ability to deduct interest payable on the 2030 Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes or preclude the 2030 Notes from being recognized as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes, or if the Company is required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. In each case, the redemption would be at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the 2030 Notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. 
 On January 18, 2022, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of 300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.125 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2032 (the 2032 Notes for net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and issuance costs, of approximately 296.4 million.

 Liquidity and Capital Adequacy Requirements 
 Risk-Based Capital. We, as well as our bank subsidiary, are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and other discretionary actions by regulators that, if enforced, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Our capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators as to components, risk weightings and other factors. 
 In July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule to revise their risk-based and leverage capital requirements and their method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with the agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in Basel III: A Global Regulatory Framework for More Resilient Banks and Banking Systems and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act Basel III ). Basel III applies to all depository institutions, bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of 500 million or more, and savings and loan holding companies. Basel III became effective for the Company and its bank subsidiary on January 1, 2015. Basel III limits a banking organization s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, which is in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. 
 Basel III amended the prompt corrective action rules to incorporate a common equity Tier 1 ("CET1") capital requirement and to raise the capital requirements for certain capital categories. In order to be adequately capitalized for purposes of the prompt corrective action rules, a banking organization is required to have at least a 4.5 CET1 risk-based capital ratio, a 4 Tier 1 leverage ratio, a 6 Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and an 8 total risk-based capital ratio. 
 Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require us to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total and Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, and of Tier 1 capital to average assets. Management believes that, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we met all regulatory capital adequacy requirements to which we were subject. 
 On December 21, 2018, the federal banking agencies issued a joint final rule to revise their regulatory capital rules to permit bank holding companies and banks to phase-in, for regulatory capital purposes, the day-one impact of the new CECL accounting rule on retained earnings over a period of three years. As part of its response to the impact of COVID-19, on March 27, 2020, the federal banking regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that provided the option to temporarily delay certain effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period. The interim final rule allows bank holding companies and banks to delay for two years 100 of the day-one impact of adopting CECL and 25 of the cumulative change in the reported allowance for credit losses since adopting CECL. The Company has elected to adopt the interim final rule, which is reflected in the risk-based capital ratios presented below.

 As of the most recent notification from regulatory agencies, our bank subsidiary was well-capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well-capitalized, we, as well as our banking subsidiary, must maintain minimum CET1 capital, leverage, Tier 1 risk-based capital, and total risk-based capital ratios as set forth in the table. There are no conditions or events since that notification that we believe have changed the bank subsidiary s category.

The items used in these calculations are included in financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. 
 Earnings, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are meaningful non-GAAP financial measures for management, as they exclude certain items such as merger expenses and/or certain gains and losses. Management believes the exclusion of these items in expressing earnings provides a meaningful foundation for period-to-period and company-to-company comparisons, which management believes will aid both investors and analysts in analyzing our financial measures and predicting future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of our business, because management does not consider these items to be relevant to ongoing financial performance. 
 In Table 20 below, we have provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP calculation of the financial measure for the periods indicated.

 We had 1.44 billion, 1.45 billion, and 1.45 billion in total goodwill and core deposit intangibles as of September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Because of our level of intangible assets and related amortization expenses, management believes tangible book value per share, return on average assets excluding intangible amortization, return on average tangible equity, return on average tangible equity excluding intangible amortization, and tangible equity to tangible assets are useful in evaluating our company. Management also believes return on average assets, as adjusted, return on average equity, as adjusted, and return on average tangible equity, as adjusted, are meaningful non-GAAP financial measures, as they exclude items such as certain non-interest income and expenses that management believes are not indicative of our primary business operating results. These calculations, which are similar to the GAAP calculations of book value per share, return on average assets, return on average equity, and equity to assets, are presented in Tables 21 through 24, respectively.

 The efficiency ratio is a standard measure used in the banking industry and is calculated by dividing non-interest expense less amortization of core deposit intangibles by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and non-interest income. The efficiency ratio, as adjusted, is a meaningful non-GAAP measure for management, as it excludes certain items and is calculated by dividing non-interest expense less amortization of core deposit intangibles by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and non-interest income excluding items such as merger expenses and/or certain gains, losses and other non-interest income and expenses. In Table 25 below, we have provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP calculation of the financial measure for the periods indicated.

 Item 3: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Liquidity and Market Risk Management 
 At September 30, 2024, we held 2.50 billion in assets that could be used for liquidity purposes, which we refer to as net available internal liquidity. This balance consisted of 1.51 billion in unpledged investment securities which could be used for additional secured borrowing capacity, 718.9 million in cash on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank ("FRB") and 270.4 million in other liquid cash accounts. 
 Consistent with our practice of maintaining access to significant external liquidity, we had 3.15 billion in net available sources of borrowed funds, which we refer to as net available external liquidity, as of September 30, 2024. This included 4.80 billion in total borrowing capacity with the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB"), of which 1.84 billion has been drawn upon in the ordinary course of business, resulting in 2.97 billion in net available liquidity with the FHLB as of September 30, 2024. The 1.84 billion consisted of 600.0 million in outstanding FHLB advances and 1.24 billion used for pledging purposes. We also had access to approximately 785.6 million in liquidity with the FRB as of September 30, 2024, of which 700.0 million has been drawn upon in the ordinary course of business, resulting in 85.6 million in net available liquidity with the FRB as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company also had access to 55.0 million from First National Bankers Bank ("FNBB"), and 45.0 million from other various external sources.

 We have continued to limit our exposure to uninsured deposits and have been actively monitoring this exposure in light of the current banking environment. As of September 30, 2024, we held approximately 8.18 billion in uninsured deposits of which 766.2 million were intercompany subsidiary deposit balances and 2.81 billion were collateralized deposits, for a net position of 4.61 billion. This represented approximately 27.6 of total deposits. In addition, net available liquidity exceeded uninsured and uncollateralized deposits by 1.04 billion as of September 30, 2024.

 Asset/Liability Management . Our management actively measures and manages interest rate risk. The asset/liability committees of the boards of directors of our holding company and bank subsidiary are also responsible for approving our asset/liability management policies, overseeing the formulation and implementation of strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and earnings, and reviewing our interest rate sensitivity position. 
 Our objective is to manage liquidity in a way that ensures cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers are met in a timely and orderly fashion while ensuring the reliance on various funding sources does not become so heavily weighted to any one source that it causes undue risk to the bank. Our liquidity sources are prioritized based on availability and ease of activation. Our current liquidity condition is a primary driver in determining our funding needs and is a key component of our asset and liability management. 
 Various sources of liquidity are available to meet the cash flow needs of depositors and borrowers. Our principal source of funds is core deposits, including checking, savings, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. We may also from time to time obtain wholesale funding through brokered deposits. Secondary sources of funding include advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window and other borrowings, such as through correspondent banking relationships. These secondary sources enable us to borrow funds at rates and terms which, at times, are more beneficial to us. Additionally, as needed, we can liquidate or utilize our available-for-sale investment portfolio as collateral to provide funds for an intermediate source of liquidity.

 Interest Rate Sensitivity . Our primary business is banking and the resulting earnings, primarily net interest income, are susceptible to changes in market interest rates. It is management s goal to maximize net interest income within acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risks. 
 A key element in the financial performance of financial institutions is the level and type of interest rate risk assumed. The single most significant measure of interest rate risk is the relationship of the repricing periods of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The more closely the repricing periods are correlated, the less interest rate risk we assume. We use net interest income simulation modeling and economic value of equity as the primary methods in analyzing and managing interest rate risk. 
 One of the tools that our management uses to measure short-term interest rate risk is a net interest income simulation model. This analysis calculates the difference between net interest income forecasted using base market rates and using a rising and a falling interest rate scenario. The income simulation model includes various assumptions regarding the re-pricing relationships for each of our products. Many of our assets are floating rate loans, which are assumed to re-price immediately, and proportional to the change in market rates, depending on their contracted index. Some loans and investments include the opportunity of prepayment (embedded options), and accordingly, the simulation model uses indexes to estimate these prepayments and reinvest their proceeds at current yields. Our non-term deposit products re-price overnight in the model while we project certain other deposits by product type to have stable balances based on our deposit history. This accounts for the portion of our portfolio that moves more slowly than market rates and changes at our discretion. 
 This analysis indicates the impact of changes in net interest income for the given set of rate changes and assumptions. It assumes the balance sheet remains static and that its structure does not change over the course of the year. It does not account for all factors that impact this analysis, including changes by management to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes or secondary impacts such as changes to our credit risk profile as interest rates change. 
 Furthermore, loan prepayment rate estimates and spread relationships change regularly. Interest rate changes create changes in actual loan prepayment rates that will differ from the market estimates incorporated in this analysis. Changes that vary significantly from the assumptions may have significant effects on our net interest income. 
 
 For the rising and falling interest rate scenarios, the base market interest rate forecast was increased and decreased over twelve months by 200 and 100 basis points, respectively. At September 30, 2024, our net interest margin exposure related to these hypothetical changes in market interest rates was within the current guidelines established by us. 
 Table 26 presents our sensitivity to net interest income as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. 
 Table 26: Sensitivity of Net Interest Income 
 Percentage Change from Base Percentage Change from Base September 30,

 There have been no material changes in our market risk exposure from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024. Our balance sheet mix has remained consistent, and there has been only one target rate change by the Federal Reserve reducing the target rate from 5.25 to 5.50 as of July 26, 2023, to 4.75 to 5.00 on September 18, 2024.
