 Beginning in 2022, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017 eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures for tax purposes in the period the expenses were incurred and instead requires all U.S. and foreign research and development expenditures to be amortized over five and fifteen tax years, respectively. 
 Due to this required capitalization of research and development expenditures, the Company has recorded current U.S. income tax expense of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The current U.S. income tax provision is primarily for federal and state taxes currently payable that we anticipate paying as a result of statutory limitations on our ability to offset expected taxable income with net operating loss carry forwards. 
 The realization of tax benefits of net deferred tax assets is dependent upon future levels of taxable income, of an appropriate character, in the periods the items are expected to be deductible or taxable. Based on the available objective evidence, except with respect to the UK deferred tax assets described below, the Company does not believe it is more likely than not that certain net deferred tax assets will be realizable. Accordingly, the Company continues to provide a full valuation allowance against the entire domestic net deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company intends to maintain the full valuation allowance on the U.S. net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support a reversal of, or decrease in, the valuation allowance. 
 On September 30, 2024, RingCentral UK Ltd RC UK ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a License Agreement and a Limited Risk Distributor Agreement with the Company, which resulted in the reclassification of RC UK from a Full Risk Distributor into a Limited Risk Distributor. The Company determined that it was more likely than not that the UK deferred tax assets were realizable. As a result, during the third quarter of 2024, the Company released the valuation allowance against the UK deferred tax assets and recorded a million income tax benefit under (benefit from) provision for income taxes in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits.

 Pursuant to the terms of the respective Convertible Notes Indentures, effective January 1, 2022, the Company made an irrevocable election to settle the principal portion of the Convertible Notes only in cash, with the conversion premium to be settled in cash or shares. 
 The Company calculates the potential dilutive effect of its Convertible Notes under the if-converted method. Under this method, only the amounts settled in excess of the principal will be considered in diluted earnings per share, in line with the terms of the Convertible Notes Indentures. 
 The denominator for diluted net income per share does not include any effect from the capped call transactions the Company entered into concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Notes as this effect would be anti-dilutive. In the event of conversion of the Convertible Notes, if shares are delivered to the Company under the capped call, they will offset the dilutive effect of the shares that the Company would issue under the Convertible Notes.

 Our portfolio of cloud-based offerings are subscription based and made available at different rates varying by the specific functionalities, services, and number of users. We primarily generate revenues from the sale of subscriptions to our offerings. Our subscription plans have monthly, annual, or multi-year contractual terms. We believe that this flexibility in contract duration is important to meet the different needs of our customers. For each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, subscriptions revenues accounted for over 90 of our total revenues. The remainder of our revenues are primarily comprised of product revenues from the sale of pre-configured phones and professional services. We do not develop or manufacture physical phones and only offer them as a convenience to our customers. We rely on third-party providers to develop and manufacture these devices and fulfillment partners to successfully serve our customers. 
 We use our direct inside sales force and indirect sales channels to market our brand and our subscription offerings. Our indirect sales channels who sell our solutions consist of: 
 Regional and global network of resellers and distributors; 
 Global Service Providers and strategic partners who market and sell our RingEX, RingCX or other solutions, including co-branded solutions. 
 Our revenue growth has primarily been driven by our flagship RingEX, RingCentral contact center solutions, and recurring license and other fees. Our revenue is derived from sales through our direct and indirect sales channels, including resellers and distributors, strategic partners and global service providers. As of September 30, 2024, we had customers from a range of industries, including financial services, education, healthcare, legal services, real estate, retail, technology, insurance, construction, hospitality, and state and local government, among others. For each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the vast majority of our total revenues were generated in the U.S. and Canada. 
 The growth of our business and our future success depend on many factors, including our ability to expand our customer base, expand our indirect sales channels, continue to innovate, grow revenues from our existing customer base, increase our sales and revenues from our existing and new products, expand our distribution channels, and scale internationally. 
 Beginning in 2023, pursuant to our approved reduction-in-force plan as part of broader efforts to optimize the Company s cost structure, we have been actively implementing various measures to enhance operational efficiencies. These include stricter discipline in spending, increased productivity, efficiency gains, and optimizing our go-to-market strategies. 
 Macroeconomic Conditions and Other Factors 
 We are subject to risks and exposures caused by the current macroeconomic environment. Macroeconomic factors include persistent inflation, higher interest rates, supply chain disruptions, decreased economic output, geopolitical conflict and fluctuations in currency exchange rates, all of which can cause uncertainty. The overall macroeconomic environment may affect buying behavior from larger customers that could have an adverse impact on our results. We have in the past and may in the future experience lower upsell and increased downsell of additional RingEX (formerly Ring MVP) services within our existing base as customers slow hiring and rationalize their employee counts. We continuously monitor the impact of these circumstances on our business and financial results, as well as the overall global economy and geopolitical landscape. The implications of macroeconomic conditions on our business, results of operations and overall financial position, particularly in the long term, remain uncertain. 
 
 Key Business Metrics 
 In addition to United States generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP and financial measures such as total revenues, gross margin, and cash flows from operations, we regularly review a number of key business metrics to evaluate growth trends, measure our performance, and make strategic decisions. We discuss revenues and gross margin under Results of Operations , and cash flow from operations and free cash flows under Liquidity and Capital Resources. Other key business metrics are discussed below. 
 Annualized Exit Monthly Recurring Subscriptions 
 We believe that our Annualized Exit Monthly Recurring Subscriptions ARR is a leading indicator of our anticipated subscriptions revenues. We believe that trends in revenue are important to understanding the overall health of our business, and we use these trends in order to formulate financial projections and make strategic business decisions. Our ARR equals our Monthly Recurring Subscriptions multiplied by 12. Our Monthly Recurring Subscriptions equals the monthly value of all customer recurring charges at the end of a given month. For example, our Monthly Recurring Subscriptions at September 30, 2024 was 206.7 million. As such, our ARR at September 30, 2024 was 2.48 billion compared to 2.26 billion at September 30, 2023.

 Net Monthly Subscription Dollar Retention Rate 
 We believe that our Net Monthly Subscription Dollar Retention Rate provides insight into our ability to retain and grow subscriptions revenue, as well as our customers potential long-term value to us. We believe that our ability to retain our customers and expand their use of our solutions over time is a leading indicator of the stability of our revenue base and we use these trends in order to formulate financial projections and make strategic business decisions. We define our Net Monthly Subscription Dollar Retention Rate as (i) one plus (ii) the quotient of Dollar Net Change divided by Average Monthly Recurring Subscriptions. 
 We define Dollar Net Change as the quotient of (i) the difference of our Monthly Recurring Subscriptions at the end of a period minus our Monthly Recurring Subscriptions at the beginning of a period minus our Monthly Recurring Subscriptions at the end of the period from new customers we added during the period, all divided by (ii) the number of months in the period. We define our Average Monthly Recurring Subscriptions as the average of the Monthly Recurring Subscriptions at the beginning and end of the measurement period. 
 For example, if our Monthly Recurring Subscriptions were 118 at the end of a quarterly period and 100 at the beginning of the period, and 20 at the end of the period from new customers we added during the period, then the Dollar Net Change would be equal to 0.67), or the amount equal to the difference of 118 minus 100 minus 20, all divided by three months. Our Average Monthly Recurring Subscriptions would equal 109, or the sum of 100 plus 118, divided by two. Our Net Monthly Subscription Dollar Retention Rate would then equal 99.4 , or approximately 99 , or one plus the quotient of the Dollar Net Change divided by the Average Monthly Recurring Subscriptions. 
 Our key business metrics for the five quarterly periods ended September 30, 2024 were as follows (dollars in billions, except percentages):

 Subscriptions revenue . Subscriptions revenue increased by 51.9 million, or 10 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 154.6 million, or 10 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the respective prior year periods. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of new customers, sale of new products, upsells of RingEX and additional offerings to our existing customer base, derived from sales through our direct and indirect sales channels, including resellers, distributors, and global service providers. Although we expect to continue to add new customers and increase the usage of our product for existing customers, we will monitor the impact of macroeconomic factors that could have an impact on customer buying behavior and demand, including contract duration, timing of customer purchases, churn, upsell and down-sell, renewals, payment terms, and credit card declines, all of which could cause variability in our revenue. 
 Other revenue. Other revenue decreased by 1.3 million, or (5) , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the respective prior year period, primarily due to the timing of performance of revenue contracts for professional services. 
 Other revenue remained flat for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the respective prior year period. This was primarily driven by a 4.8 million increase in device sales as a result of overall growth in business, which was largely offset by a 4.6 million decrease in professional service due to the timing of performance of revenue contracts.

 Subscriptions cost of revenues and gross margin . Cost of subscriptions revenues increased by 9.7 million, or 7 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the respective prior year period. The higher cost of subscription revenues was primarily due to a 6.6 million increase in third-party costs to support our solution offerings, a 5.4 million increase in infrastructure support costs, and a 3.0 million increase in personnel and contractor costs, partially offset by a 5.7 million decrease in the amortization of our intangible assets. 
 Cost of subscriptions revenues increased by 29.0 million, or 7 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the respective prior year period. The higher cost of subscription revenues was primarily due to a 26.3 million increase in third-party costs to support our solution offerings, a 10.1 million increase in infrastructure support costs, and a 3.3 million increase in personnel and contractor costs, partially offset by an 11.1 million decrease in the amortization of our intangible assets. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the respective prior year period, our subscription gross margin remained relatively consistent period over period. We expect to continue investing in our infrastructure and capacity to improve the availability of our subscription offerings, including new products, supporting the growth of both our new and existing customers. 
 Other cost of revenues and gross margin . Cost of other revenues increased by 1.5 million, or 5 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 4.3 million, or 5 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the respective prior year period, primarily due to an increase in costs associated with phone sales.

 Sales and marketing expenses increased by 6.2 million, or 2 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the respective prior year period. This increase was primarily due to a 13.9 million increase in third-party commissions and a 6.0 million increase in amortization of deferred sales commission costs. These increases were partially offset by a 7.8 million reduction in advertising and marketing costs, and a 5.0 million decrease in personnel and contractor costs, primarily due to headcount reductions and decrease in share-based compensation due to reduced stock grants to employees. 
 Sales and marketing expenses increased by 23.8 million, or 3 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the respective prior year period. This increase was primarily driven by a 36.9 million increase in third-party commissions and an 18.4 million increase in amortization of deferred sales commission costs. These increases were partially offset by a 21.9 million decrease in personnel and contractor costs, primarily due to headcount reductions and decrease in share-based compensation due to reduced stock grants to employees, a 6.8 million reduction in advertising and marketing costs, and a 2.9 million reduction in professional fees. 
 We expect to incur incremental sales and marketing expenses to support our growth while driving cost efficiencies by further optimizing our go-to-market strategies.

 General and administrative expenses decreased by 36.6 million, or (15) , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the respective prior year period, primarily due to a 27.5 million reduction in personnel and contractor costs driven by a decrease in share-based compensation due to reduced stock grants to employees and 11.5 million reduction in professional fees, partially offset by 2.8 million increase in overhead costs. 
 We expect the general and administrative expenses to reflect the impact of our operational efficiency measures as we realign our hiring strategies and rationalize our discretionary spending.

 Interest expense . Interest expense increased by 4.2 million, or 35 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 29.2 million, or 150 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the respective prior year period. This increase was mainly attributable to interest incurred under our Credit Agreement and the 2030 Senior Notes. 
 Other income . Other income decreased by 19.4 million, or (95) , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the respective prior year period. This decline was primarily due to an 11.8 million reduction in gains from the early extinguishment of debt, and a 7.0 million gain from our amended agreement with a strategic partner during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other income decreased 48.7 million, or (79) , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the respective prior year period. This decline primarily due to a 42.9 million reduction in gains from the early extinguishment of debt during the three months ended September 30, 2023, and a 3.8 million decrease in gains related to our amended agreement with a strategic partner. 
 Other income and expense, net, can fluctuate in the future due to changes in interest rates on our money market funds, interest expense on our Credit Agreement, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates in the current macroeconomic environment. 
 Net Loss 
 Net loss decreased by 34.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the respective prior year period. This decrease was largely due to a 57.5 million reduction in loss from operations, driven by higher subscription revenues and lower operating expenses, both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue. The reduction in operating expenses was achieved through continued disciplined spending, including a 28.0 million decrease in share-based compensation and a 6.0 million reduction in professional fees. These reductions in operating expenses were partially offset by non-operating factors, including an 11.8 million decrease in gain from the early extinguishment of debt, a 7.0 million decrease in gains from our amended agreement with a strategic partner recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2023, and a 4.2 million increase in interest expense related to our 2030 Senior Notes during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Net loss decreased by 66.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the respective prior year period. This decrease was largely due to a 140.8 million reduction in loss from operations, driven by higher subscription revenues and lower operating expenses, both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue. The reduction in operating expenses was achieved through continued disciplined spending, including a 55.9 million decrease in share-based compensation and a 23.7 million reduction in professional fees.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity is a measure of our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short-term and long-term cash requirements of our business operations, and debt obligations as they become due. 
 We finance our operations primarily through sales to our customers, which could be billed either monthly or annually one year in advance. For customers with annual or multi-year contracts and those who opt for annual invoicing, we generally invoice only one annual period in advance and revenue is deferred for such advanced billings. We also have access to additional liquidity from our Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of 212.7 million and 222.2 million, respectively. 
 Our outstanding principal debt as of September 30, 2024 was comprised of 161.3 million from our 2025 Convertible Notes due on March 1, 2025, 609.1 million from our 2026 Convertible Notes due on March 15, 2026, 375.0 million under our Term Loan due on February 14, 2028, as well as 400.0 million under our 2030 Senior Notes due on August 15, 2030. As of September 30, 2024, we have 350.0 million available under our delayed draw-down Term Loan and 225.0 million available under our Revolving Credit Facility. Refer to Note 6, Long-Term Debt , in the accompanying notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our Credit Agreement, the 2030 Senior Notes and the Convertible Notes. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we held 7.4 million in restricted cash in the form of a bank deposit for issuance of a foreign bank guarantee. 
 Under our share repurchase programs, share repurchases may be made at our discretion from time to time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, or other means, subject to a minimum cash balance. The programs do not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares of our Class A Common Stock. The timing and number of any shares repurchased under the programs will depend on a variety of factors, including stock price, trading volume, and general business and market conditions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased and settled approximately 7.5 million shares of our Class A Common Stock, by paying an aggregate amount of approximately 245.0 million under the plans previously authorized by our Board. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 242.8 million remained authorized and available under our share repurchase programs for future share repurchases. Refer to Note 11, Stockholders Deficit in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 In June 2024, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of Mitel for 26.3 million paid in cash. Refer to Note 8 - Business Combinations , in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 We believe that our operations, existing liquidity sources as well as capital resources and ability to raise cash through additional financing will satisfy our future cash requirements and obligations for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including revenue growth and costs incurred to support customer growth, acquisitions and expansions, sales and marketing, research and development, increased general and administrative expenses to support the anticipated growth in our operations, and capital equipment required to support our headcount and in support of our co-location data center facilities, our interest payments for both our Term Loan and 2030 Senior Notes, the repurchase, repayment or otherwise settlement of a portion of our 2025 Convertible Notes and/or our 2026 Convertible Notes, as well as the impact of the global macroeconomic conditions. Our capital expenditures in future periods are expected to grow in line with our business. We continually evaluate our capital needs and may decide to raise additional capital to fund the growth of our business for general corporate purposes through public or private equity offerings or through additional debt financing. The timing and amount of any such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors, including the maturity dates of our existing debt. We may from time to time seek to refinance certain of our outstanding debt through issuances of new notes or convertible debt, term loans, exchange transactions or debt repurchases. Such issuances, exchanges or repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our ability to negotiate acceptable terms, our liquidity position and other factors. Refer to risk factors in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for discussion of risks relating to our liquidity and capital resources.

 The table below provides selected cash flow information for the periods indicated (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 350,394 285,818 Net cash used in investing activities (88,306) (70,465) Net cash used in financing activities (273,067) (51,798) Effect of exchange rate changes 1,436 (1,187) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (9,543) 162,368 
 Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities 
 Cash provided by operating activities is driven by the timing of customer collections, as well as the amount and timing of disbursements to our vendors, the amount of cash we invest in personnel, marketing, and infrastructure costs to support the anticipated growth of our business, and payments under strategic arrangements. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 350.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The cash flow from operating activities was primarily driven by timing of cash receipts from customers and global service providers, offset by cash payments for personnel-related costs and payments to vendors along with interest payments on our debt obligations. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 64.6 million as compared to the respective prior year period. This change reflects working capital impacts resulting from the timing of payments and collections as well as interest payments on our debt obligations. 
 Net Cash Used In Investing Activities 
 Our primary investing activities consist of our capital expenditures and expenditures for internal-use software, intellectual property assets, and cash paid for business acquisitions. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 88.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This was primarily driven by 59.5 million in capital expenditures, including personnel-related costs associated with the development of internal-use software, and 26.3 million in cash paid for the acquisition of certain assets from Mitel. 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 17.8 million as compared to the respective prior year period. This increase was primarily driven by 11.6 million for business acquisitions, and 3.7 million in capital expenditures, including personnel-related costs associated with the development of internal-use software. 
 Net Cash Used In Financing Activities 
 Our primary financing activities include utilizing cash to repurchase Class A Common Stock under our share repurchase programs, servicing and repaying debt, paying contingent consideration, raising capital through stock issuance under our stock plans, paying taxes related to these plans, and meeting our existing financing commitments. 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 273.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This was primarily driven by 245.0 million paid to repurchase and retire approximately 7.5 million shares of Class A Common Stock under our share repurchase program. Additionally, cash outflows included 19.3 million for debt service costs and debt repayments, 10.3 million for contingent consideration, 5.3 million for taxes associated with our stock plans, and 3.1 million to fulfill our existing financing commitments. These expenditures were partially offset by 10.0 million in proceeds from issuance of stock in connection with our stock plans. 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 221.3 million as compared to the respective prior year period. This increase was primarily due to a 205.4 million net financing cash inflow during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of issuance of new debt and repurchase of convertible notes. The increase in net cash used in financing activities also included 14.3 million for debt service costs and repayments, as well as an 8.7 million increase in contingent consideration payments. These increases were partially offset by a 4.6 million reduction in payments for the repurchase and retirement of our Class A Common Stock. 
 Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow 
 To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows to analyze cash flow generated from our operations. We define free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as GAAP net cash provided by (used in) operating activities adjusted for capitalized expenditures that include purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software. We believe information regarding free cash flow provides useful information to management and investors in understanding the strength of liquidity and available cash. A limitation of the use of free cash flow is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. Free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to cash flows from operations, and should be considered alongside our other GAAP-based financial liquidity performance measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities and our other GAAP financial results. 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods presented (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 350,394 285,818 Capitalized expenditures (59,475) (55,756) Non-GAAP free cash flow 290,919 230,062 
 
 Remaining Performance Obligations 
 We have generally signed new customer contracts with typical subscription term ranging from one month to five years. At any point in the contract term, there can be amounts allocated to services that we have not yet contractually performed, which constitute our remaining performance obligations. Until we meet our performance obligations, we do not recognize them as revenues in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Given the variability in our contract length, our remaining performance obligations exclude contracts with an original expected length of less than one year. We believe that our remaining performance obligation is not a reliable indicator of future revenues as it is influenced by several factors, including contract renewal timing, average contract terms and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not utilize remaining performance obligation as a key management metric internally. 
 
 Deferred Revenue 
 Deferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of monthly or annual invoiced fees for our subscriptions, which we recognize as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. For customers with multi-year contracts, we generally invoice for only one monthly or annual subscription period in advance. Therefore, our deferred revenue balance does not capture the full contract value of multi-year contracts. Accordingly, we believe that deferred revenue is not a reliable indicator of future revenues and we do not utilize deferred revenue as a key management metric internally.

 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 Except as set forth below, and in Notes 3, 6, 9 and 10 in the accompanying notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there were no significant changes in our commitments under contractual obligations, as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as amended on April 24, 2024. 
 Contingencies 
 We are and may be in the future subject to certain legal proceedings and from time to time may be involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations, and proceedings relating to contractual disputes, intellectual property rights, employment matters, regulatory compliance matters, and other matters relating to various claims that arise in the normal course of business. We record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount of loss. Such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a significant impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Use of Estimates 
 The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The significant estimates made by management affect revenues, the allowance for doubtful accounts, deferred and prepaid sales commission costs, goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets, share-based compensation, capitalization of internally developed software, return reserves, derivative instruments, provision for income taxes, uncertain tax positions, valuation of contingent consideration, loss contingencies, sales tax liabilities and accrued liabilities. Management periodically evaluates these estimates and will make adjustments prospectively based upon the results of such periodic evaluations. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 The majority of our sales and contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore our net revenue is not currently subject to significant foreign currency risk. As part of our international operations, we charge customers in British Pounds, European Union EU Euro, Canadian Dollars and Australian Dollars, among others. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and volatility in the market due to global economic conditions could cause variability in our subscriptions revenues, total revenues, annualized exit monthly recurring subscriptions revenues and operating results. Our operating expenses are generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located, which are primarily in the U.S., and to a lesser extent in Canada, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is generally the local currency. Our consolidated results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. To date, we have not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency risk. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to 
 39 

Table of Contents 

 our business would not have had a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. As our international operations continue to expand, risks associated with fluctuating foreign currency rates may increase. We will continue to reassess our approach to managing these risks. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 212.7 million. We invest our cash and cash equivalents in short-term money market funds. The carrying amount of our cash equivalents reasonably approximates fair values. Due to the short-term nature of our money-market funds, we believe that exposure to changes in interest rates will not have a material impact on the fair value of our cash equivalents. Interest income may further fluctuate in the future due to interest rate volatility in the current macroeconomic environment. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in overall interest rates would not have had a material impact on our interest income. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 161.3 million and 609.1 million outstanding from our 2025 Convertible Notes and 2026 Convertible Notes, respectively. We carry the Convertible Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our balance sheet, and we present the fair value for required disclosure purposes only. The Convertible Notes have a zero percent fixed annual interest rate and, therefore, we have no economic exposure to changes in interest rates. The fair value of the Convertible Notes is exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair value of our fixed interest rate Convertible Notes will increase as interest rates decline and decrease as interest rates increase. In addition, the fair values of the Convertible Notes are affected by our stock price. The fair value of the Convertible Notes will generally increase as our Class A common stock price increases and will generally decrease as our Class A common stock price decrease in value. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility and 375.0 million outstanding under our Term Loan under our Credit Agreement. Borrowings under our Credit Agreement will bear interest under a floating rate mechanism, which exposes us to interest-rate risk. To address this risk, we entered into a five-year floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreement with the objective of reducing exposure to the fluctuating interest rates associated with our variable rate borrowing program by paying a fixed interest rate of 3.79 , plus a margin of 2 to 3 . The interest rate swap agreement became effective on June 30, 2023, and terminates on February 14, 2028, consistent with the duration of the maturity of the Term Loan. Our interest rate swap agreement is designated as cash flow hedge and highly effective in offsetting changes in our future expected cash flows due to the fluctuation of our variable rate debt. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 400.0 million outstanding under our 2030 Senior Notes. The 2030 Senior Notes have fixed annual interest rates, and therefore we do not have economic interest rate exposure on these debt obligations. However, the fair values of our 2030 Senior Notes are exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair values of the 2030 Senior Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. 
 Inflation Risk 
 We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Nonetheless, if our costs in connection with the operation of our business were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

 Information with respect to this item may be found in Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies , in the accompanying notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under Legal Matters , which is incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risk factors set forth below. The risks and uncertainties described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also affect our business. See the section entitled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the forward-looking statements that are qualified by these risk factors. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs and have a material adverse effect on us, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed. 
 Summary Risk Factors 
 An investment in our Class A Common Stock involves a high degree of risk, and the following is a summary of key risk factors when considering an investment. This is only a summary. You should read this summary together with the more detailed description of each risk factor contained in the subheadings further below and other risks. 
 We have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows in the past and anticipate continuing to incur losses for at least the foreseeable future, and we may therefore not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future. 
 Our quarterly and annual results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may continue to do so in the future. As a result, we may fail to meet or to exceed the expectations of research analysts or investors, which could cause our stock price to fluctuate. 
 We rely on third parties, including third parties in countries outside the U.S., primarily in Georgia and the Philippines for a significant portion of our software development and design, quality assurance, operations, and customer support. 
 Global economic conditions may harm our industry, business and results of operations, including the effects of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and related international sanctions against Russia, the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, any potential worsening or expansion of these wars, and relations between the United States and China. 
 Our growth and the quickly changing markets in which we operate make it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects, which may increase the risk of investing in our stock. 
 We face intense competition in our markets and may lack sufficient financial or other resources to compete successfully. 
 We rely and may in the future rely significantly on our agents, brokers, resellers, and global service providers to market and sell our subscriptions; our failure to effectively develop, manage, and maintain our indirect sales channels could materially and adversely affect our revenues. 
 To deliver our subscriptions, we rely on third parties for our network connectivity and for certain of the features in our subscriptions. 
 We rely on third-party competitors to deliver video, contact center and SMS services to customers, and changes in these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Interruptions or delays in service from our third-party data center hosting facilities and other third-party providers could impair the delivery of our subscriptions, require us to issue credits or pay penalties and harm our business.

 Failures in Internet infrastructure or interference with broadband access could cause current or potential users to believe that our systems are unreliable, possibly leading our customers to switch to our competitors or to avoid using our subscriptions. 
 A security incident, such as a cyber-attack, information security breach or denial of service event could delay or interrupt service to our customers, harm our reputation or business, impact our subscriptions, and subject us to significant liability. 
 We depend largely on the continued services of our senior management and other highly-skilled employees, and if we are unable to hire, retain, manage and motivate our employees, we may not be able to grow effectively and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 Increased customer turnover, or costs we incur to retain and upsell our customers, could materially and adversely affect our financial performance. 
 If we are unable to attract new customers to our subscriptions or upsell to those customers on a cost-effective basis, our business will be materially and adversely affected. 
 The AI technology and features incorporated into our solutions include new and evolving technologies that may present both legal and business risks. 
 Our subscriptions are subject to regulation, and future legislative or regulatory actions could adversely affect our business and expose us to liability in the U.S. and internationally. 
 Our Credit Agreement imposes operating and financial restrictions on us. 
 Servicing our debt, including the Notes and Credit Agreement, may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay all of our indebtedness. 
 The Senior Notes Indenture contains restrictive, operational, and financial covenants that may limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. 
 For as long as the dual class structure of our common stock as contained in our charter documents is in effect, voting control will be concentrated with a limited number of stockholders that held our stock prior to our initial public offering, including primarily our founders and their affiliates, and limiting other stockholders ability to influence corporate matters. 
 Our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock has rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to the rights of, our common stockholders, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. 
 Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry 
 We have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows in the past and anticipate continuing to incur losses for at least the foreseeable future, and we may therefore not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future. 
 We have incurred substantial net losses since our inception. We have historically spent considerable amounts of time and money to develop new business communications solutions and enhanced versions of our existing business communications solutions to position us for future growth. Additionally, we have incurred substantial losses and expended significant resources upfront to market, promote and sell our solutions and expect to continue to do so in the future. We also expect to continue to invest for future growth, including for advertising, customer acquisition, technology infrastructure, storage capacity, services development, regulatory compliance, and international expansion. In addition, as a public company, we incur significant accounting, legal, and other expenses. 
 We expect to continue to incur losses for at least the foreseeable future and will have to generate and sustain increased revenues to achieve future profitability. Achieving profitability will require us to increase revenues, manage our cost structure, and avoid significant liabilities. Revenue growth has slowed and in the future, revenues may decline, or we may incur significant losses in the future for a number of possible reasons, including general macroeconomic conditions, increasing competition (including competitive pricing pressures), a decrease in customer demand or the growth of the markets in which we compete, in particular the UCaaS, CCaaS and software-as-a-service SaaS markets, or if we fail for any reason to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities, including those related to our AI-based initiatives. Additionally, we may encounter unforeseen operating expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, service delivery, and quality problems and other unknown factors that may result in losses in future periods. If these losses exceed our expectations or our revenue growth expectations are not met in future periods, our financial performance will be harmed and our stock price could be volatile or decline.

 Our quarterly and annual results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may continue to do so in the future. As a result, we may fail to meet or to exceed the expectations of research analysts or investors, which could cause our stock price to fluctuate. 
 Our quarterly and annual results of operations have varied historically from period to period, and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including: 
 our ability to expand and retain existing customers, resellers, partners, and global service providers GSPs ), and expand our existing customers user base, and attract new customers; 
 our ability to realize the benefits of our existing GSP relationships and other GSP relationships that we may enter into in the future; 
 our ability to introduce and effectively market and sell new solutions, including both solutions that we develop or license, and solutions we purchase for resale from third parties; 
 the actions of our competitors, including pricing changes or the introduction of new solutions; 
 our ability to effectively manage our growth and achieve profitability; 
 our ability to successfully penetrate the market for larger businesses and key verticals; 
 our ability to upsell our customers to our existing and new products and services; 
 our ability to limit and manage down sell and churn; 
 our dependency on third-party vendors and competitors of hardware, software and services that we resell to our customers and our ability to effectively offer customers an alternate solution; 
 the mix of monthly, annual and multi-year subscriptions at any given time; 
 the timing, cost, and effectiveness of our advertising and marketing efforts; 
 the timing, operating cost, and capital expenditures related to the operation, maintenance and expansion of our business; 
 our ability to successfully and timely execute on, integrate, and realize the benefits of any acquisition, investment, strategic partnership, or other strategic transaction or partnership we may make or undertake; 
 service outages or actual or perceived information security breaches or incidents caused by us or the third parties upon which we rely and any related impact on our reputation; 
 our ability to accurately forecast revenues and appropriately plan our expenses; 
 our ability to realize our deferred tax assets; 
 costs associated with defending and resolving intellectual property infringement and other claims; 
 changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting rules; 
 our ability to effectively manage and repay our existing and any future debt; 
 our ability to repurchase shares of Class A Common Stock; 
 the retention of our senior management and other key employees, their ability to execute on our business plan and the loss of services of senior management or other key employees, whether in the past or in the future; 
 the timing and cost of developing or acquiring technologies, services or businesses, and our ability to successfully manage any such acquisitions; 
 our ability to execute our operating plans successfully while reducing costs and optimizing operating margin; 
 our ability to generate and grow our non-GAAP free cash flow; 
 the impact of foreign currencies on our business as we continue to expand our business internationally; and 
 the impact of worldwide economic, political, industry, and market conditions, including the effects of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and related international sanctions against Russia, the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, any potential worsening or expansion of these or other conflicts and wars, and U.S.-China relations.

 Any one of the factors above, or the cumulative effect of some or all of the factors referred to above, may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results of operations. This variability and unpredictability could result in our failure to meet our publicly announced guidance or the expectations of securities analysts or investors for any period, which could cause our stock price to decline. In addition, a significant percentage of our operating expenses is fixed in nature and are based on forecasted revenues trends. Accordingly, in the event of revenue shortfalls, we may not be able to mitigate the negative impact on net income (loss) and margins in the short term. If we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of research analysts or investors, the market price of our shares could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class-action suits. 
 
 We rely on third parties, including third parties in countries outside the U.S., primarily in Georgia and the Philippines, for a significant portion of our software development and design, quality assurance, operations, and customer support. 
 We currently depend on various third parties for some of our software development efforts, quality assurance, operations, and customer support services, including third parties in countries outside the U.S. Specifically, we have outsourced a significant portion of our software development and design, quality assurance, and operations activities to third-party contractors that have employees and consultants in Tbilisi, Georgia. 
 In addition, we outsource a significant portion of our customer support, inside sales, network operation control functions, and general and administrative activities to third-party contractors located in Manila, the Philippines. For example, we offer customer support from third-party contractors located in the Philippines through both our online account management website and our toll-free customer support number in multiple languages. The ability to support our customers may be disrupted by natural disasters, inclement weather conditions, civil unrest, strikes, and other adverse events in the Philippines. 
 Furthermore, as we continue to expand our operations internationally, we may need to make further significant expenditures and investments in our customer service and support to adequately address the complex needs of international customers, such as support in additional foreign languages. We also use third parties to deliver onsite professional services to our customers in deploying our solutions. If these vendors do not deliver timely and high-quality services to our customers, our reputation could be damaged, and we could lose customers. In addition, third-party professional services vendors may not be available when needed, which would adversely impact our ability to deliver on our customer commitments. Our dependence on third-party contractors, including those in countries outside the U.S., creates a number of risks, in particular, the risk that we may not maintain service quality, control, or effective management with respect to these business operations. 
 We also rely on purchased or leased hardware and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our subscriptions, and in some cases, we integrate third-party licensed software components into our platform. Any errors or defects in third-party hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our subscriptions which could harm our business. 
 We anticipate that we will continue to depend on our third-party relationships in order to grow our business for the foreseeable future. If we are unsuccessful in maintaining existing and, if needed, establishing new relationships with third parties, our ability to efficiently operate existing services or develop new services and provide adequate customer support could be impaired, and, as a result, our competitive position or our results of operations could suffer. 
 Global economic conditions may harm our industry, business and results of operations, including the effects of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and related international sanctions against Russia, the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, any potential worsening or expansion of these wars, and relations between the United States and China. 
 We operate globally and, as a result, our business, revenues and profitability are impacted by local microeconomic and global macroeconomic conditions. The success of our activities is affected by general economic and market conditions, including, among others, inflation rate fluctuations, interest rates, supply chain constraints, consumer confidence, volatile equity capital markets, tax rates, economic uncertainty, political instability, changes in laws, instability in the banking and financial system, and trade barriers and sanctions. Such economic volatility could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and future market disruptions could negatively impact us. Unfavorable economic conditions could increase our operating costs and, because our typical contracts with customers lock in our price for a few years such that we are generally unable to make corresponding increases in contract pricing, our profitability could be negatively affected. Geopolitical destabilization could impact global currency exchange rates, supply chains, trade and movement of resources, the price of commodities such as energy, as well as demand for our products and services, which may adversely affect the technology spending of our customers and potential customers. Geopolitical conflicts, including the effects of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and related international sanctions against Russia, the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, any potential worsening or expansion of these conflicts and wars, and U.S.-China relations, are heightening these risks.

 The U.S. presidential election could lead to changes in economic conditions or economic uncertainties in the United States and globally. Any such changes or uncertainties, including in international trade relations, legislation and regulations (including those related to taxation and importation), or economic and monetary policies, could result in heightened diplomatic tensions or political and civil unrest, among other potential impacts, and have a material adverse effect on the global economy as a whole and/or our business, or may require us to significantly modify one or more of our current business practices. 
 Some of our international agreements provide for payment denominated in local currencies, and the majority of our local costs are denominated in local currencies. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies may impact our operating results when translated into U.S. dollars. Thus, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Bulgarian Lev, Chinese Yuan, Indian Rupee, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, and Singapore Dollar, and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Certain changes in exchange rates have and may continue to negatively affect our revenues, expenses, and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars in the future. 
 Our growth and the quickly changing markets in which we operate make it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects, which may increase the risk of investing in our stock. 
 We have encountered and expect to continue to encounter risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing markets. If our assumptions regarding these uncertainties are incorrect or change in reaction to changes in our markets, or if we do not manage or address these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations, and our business could suffer. 
 Growth may place significant demands on our management and our infrastructure. 
 We continue to experience growth in our business. This growth has placed and may continue to place significant demands on our management, organizational structure, and our operational and financial infrastructure, particularly as we try to become more profitable and financially and operationally efficient. As our operations continue to scale and become more complex, we may need to increase our sales and marketing efforts and may add additional sales and marketing personnel in various regions worldwide and improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to attract, service, and retain an increasing number of customers. For example, we expect the volume of simultaneous calls and video conferences to increase significantly as our customer base grows. Our network hardware and software may not be able to accommodate this additional simultaneous call volume. The expansion of our systems and infrastructure could require us to commit substantial financial, operational, and technical resources in advance of an increase in the volume of business, with no assurance that the volume of business will increase. Any such additional capital investments will increase our cost base. 
 Continued growth could also strain our ability to maintain reliable service levels for our customers, resellers, partners, and GSPs, develop and improve our operational, financial and management controls, enhance our billing and reporting systems and procedures, and recruit, train and retain highly skilled personnel. In addition, our existing systems, processes, and controls may not prevent or detect all errors, omissions, or fraud. We may also experience difficulties in managing improvements to our systems, processes, and controls or in connection with third-party software licensed to help us with such improvements. Any future growth, particularly further international expansion and the transition to a multi-product company, could add complexity to our organization, require effective communication and coordination throughout our organization, and result in additional costs. To manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial, operating, security and administrative systems and controls, and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans and processes. Additionally, our productivity and the quality of our solutions and services may be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively. If we fail to achieve the necessary level of efficiency in our organization as we grow, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. 
 We face intense competition in our markets and may lack sufficient financial or other resources to compete successfully. 
 The cloud-based business communications and collaboration solutions industry is highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future. We face intense competition from other providers of UCaaS, CCaaS, Communications Platform as a Service CPaaS ), messaging, video, fax, virtual events, AI (including quality management, sales assistant and other AI driven functionalities), virtual assistant, work-force management/optimization WFM/WFO and other communication products and services. Our competitors include traditional on-premises, hardware business communications providers, cloud, hybrid and hosted communications providers, global service providers and each of their channel partners, resellers, distributors and agents who offer proprietary or other third-party cloud business communications products and 
 46 

Table of Contents 

 services. As a result, several of the companies with whom we have commercial relationships, such as our global service providers, OEM resellers, and channel partners, also offer, market and sell competing products and services. 
 Our competitors include but are not limited to: 8x8, Inc., Dialpad, Inc., LogMeIn, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, Nextiva, Inc., Twilio Inc., Ericsson Vonage ), Zoom Video Communications, Inc. Zoom ), Amazon.com, Inc., AT T Inc. AT T ), BT Group plc BT ), TELUS Corporation TELUS ), Vodafone Group Plc Vodafone ), Deutsche Telekom DT ), Avaya LLC Avaya ), Mitel Networks Corporation Mitel ), Cisco Systems, Inc. WebEx ), Alphabet Inc. Google Voice ), Meta Platforms, Inc., Oracle Corporation, and Salesforce.com, Inc., Five9, Inc., NICE InContact (including LiveVox Holdings, Inc.), Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories, Inc., Talkdesk, Inc., Verint Systems Inc., Calabrio, Inc., yellow.ai, ON24, Inc., Cvent Holding Corp., Gong.io Inc. and Outreach Corporation. 
 Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater resources and name recognition, more diversified offerings, international presence, and larger customer bases than we have. As a result, these competitors may have greater credibility with our existing and potential customers and may be better able to withstand an extended period of downward pricing pressure. In addition, certain of our competitors have partnered with, or been acquired by, and may in the future partner with or acquire, other competitors to offer services, leveraging their collective competitive positions, which makes it more difficult to compete with them and could significantly and adversely affect our results of operations. Demand for our platform is also sensitive to price. Many factors, including our marketing, user acquisition and technology costs, and our current and future competitors pricing and marketing strategies, can significantly affect our pricing strategies. Our competitors may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and promotions and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their services than we can to ours. Some of our competitors have in the past and may choose in the future to sacrifice revenues and/or profitability to gain market share by offering their services at lower prices or for free, or offering alternative pricing models, such as freemium pricing, in which a basic offering is provided for free with advanced features provided for a fee, on the services they offer. Our competitors may also offer bundled service arrangements that provide more complete service offerings with other functionality that we do not offer (such as broadband), thereby making them more attractive to potential customers despite the technical merits or advantages of our platform. Competition could result in a decrease to our prices, increase customer acquisition costs, slow our growth, increase our customer turnover, reduce our sales, or decrease our market share, any or all of which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and growth. 
 We rely and may in the future rely significantly on our agents, brokers, resellers, and global service providers to market and sell our subscriptions; our failure to effectively develop, manage, and maintain our indirect sales channels could materially and adversely affect our revenues. 
 Our future success depends on our continued ability to establish and maintain a network of channel relationships and partnerships, including GSPs and Avaya. A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from our network of sales agents, brokers, and resellers, which we refer to collectively as channel partners, many of which sell or may in the future decide to sell their own business communications services or business communications services from other providers. Governmental regulators and contractual restrictions with telecom carriers may also restrict the ability of our channel partners and resellers to resell our products and services in some countries. We generally do not have long-term contracts with these channel partners, and the loss of or reduction in sales through these third parties could materially reduce our revenues. Our competitors may in some cases be effective in causing our current or potential channel partners to favor their services or prevent or reduce sales of our subscriptions. Furthermore, while some of our GSPs, such as AT T, BT, TELUS, Vodafone and DT, as well as Avaya, also sell and market our solutions on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis, they may also sell and market competing business communications. Some of these companies have significantly greater resources than us and currently, or may in the future, develop and/or host their own or third-party cloud solutions. Such competitors may cease marketing or selling our solutions to their customers and may ultimately be able to transition some or all of those customers onto their competing solutions, which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and growth. 
 We have also entered into certain agreements with our strategic partners and global service providers to sell and market certain of our solutions. However, there can be no guarantee that our strategic partners, global service providers and/or any of their respective channel partners will be successful in marketing or selling our solutions or that they will not cease marketing or selling our solutions in the future. Further, certain strategic partners have failed in the past, and may fail in the future, to meet their minimum contractual seat and/or revenue commitments, including recoupment of advance payments. We have in the past, and may in the future, renegotiate the terms of our GSP relationships and strategic partnership agreements, including converting strategic partners from exclusive to non-exclusive partners. 
 47

 In addition, we are in the process of transforming our channel partner go-to-market strategy, to better enable a resale/wholesale model, which requires significant changes to our systems and processes. These system and process changes could result in longer time to implement our strategy which could have an impact on our revenue. 
 If our strategic partners and global service providers and/or any of their respective channel partners are not successful in marketing and selling our solutions or cease to market and sell our solutions, our revenues and growth could be significantly and adversely affected. If we fail to maintain relationships with our channel partners, GSPs and strategic partners or fail to develop new and expanded relationships in existing or new markets, or if our networks of indirect channel relationships are not successful in their sales efforts, sales of our subscriptions may decrease and our operating results would suffer. In addition, we may not be successful in managing, training, and providing appropriate incentives to our existing resellers and other channel partners, GSPs and strategic partners, and they may not be able to commit adequate resources in order to successfully sell our solutions. 
 To deliver our subscriptions, we rely on third parties for our network connectivity and for certain of the features in our subscriptions. 
 We currently use the infrastructure of third-party network service providers, including Inteliquent, Inc., Lumen Technologies, Inc. and Bandwidth.com, Inc. in North America and several others internationally, to deliver our subscriptions over their networks. Our third-party network service providers provide access to their Internet protocol IP networks and public switched telephone networks, and provide call termination and origination services, including 911 emergency calling in the U.S. and equivalent services internationally, and local number portability for our customers. We expect that we will continue to rely heavily on third-party network service providers to provide these subscriptions for the foreseeable future. 
 If any of these network service providers stop providing us with access to their infrastructure, fail to provide these services to us on a cost-effective basis or at reasonable levels of quality and security, cease operations, or otherwise terminate these services, the delay caused by qualifying and switching to another third-party network service provider, if one is available, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 Finally, if problems occur with any of these third-party network service providers, it may cause outages, errors or poor call quality in our subscriptions, and we could encounter difficulty identifying the source of the problem. The occurrence of outages, errors or poor call quality in our subscriptions, whether caused by our systems or a third-party network or service provider, may result in the loss of our existing customers, delay or loss of market acceptance of our subscriptions, termination of our relationships and agreements with our channel partners, strategic partners, or global service providers, or liability for failure to meet service level agreements which may require us to issue service credits or pay damages, and may seriously harm our business and results of operations. 
 We rely on third-party competitors to deliver video, contact center and SMS services to customers, and changes in these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 We currently use third-party technology from Zoom, NICE inContact and Bandwidth to provide video, contact center and SMS solutions, respectively, to certain of our customers. We use, or in the future, may use and rely on technologies of other third-parties to deliver features and functionalities. We cannot assure you that we will be able to renew our agreements with any of these third-party providers and any of these service providers could elect or attempt to stop providing us with access to their services. In addition, these third-party providers may terminate or breach their contracts with us, or allow these contracts to expire. If any of these service providers cease to provide us with their services, fails to provide these services to us on a cost-effective basis or at reasonable levels of quality and security, ceases operations, or otherwise terminates or discontinues these services, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our inability to continue to offer Zoom and NICE InContact solutions to our customers and/or our inability to effectively offer or migrate these customers to our own alternative or other third-party alternative solutions would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Relatedly, U.S. mobile carriers are now requiring businesses using SMS on over-the-top providers, including all CPaaS and UCaaS providers, such as RingCentral, to register with The Campaign Registry TCR ), to ensure text messages are compliant with wireless carrier guidelines, as well as to reduce spam. These new rules affect our customers, and we have built integrations with TCR to facilitate those registrations for our customers. TCR registration and related vetting can be cumbersome and costly and may cause customer churn, especially for SMB customers that have more limited person-to-person SMS needs. Additionally, SMS aggregators and wireless carriers sometimes block legitimate SMS traffic without prior notice, which may negatively impact our customers. Bandwidth, RingCentral s SMS aggregator, has announced that starting December 
 48 

Table of Contents 

 1, 2024, they will block any and all SMS sent by phone numbers that have not been registered with TCR and associated with an approved messaging campaign. Despite our ongoing efforts to minimize the impact on our customers, our potential inability to provide SMS to affected customers may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 We also offer solutions through third-party integrations, such as with Microsoft and Salesforce, often where we may not have recourse to the underlying third-party provider. For example, we offer a direct routing integration with Microsoft Teams; however, there is a limited certification process for the Microsoft Teams direct routing integration, which is offered by Microsoft at its option, and Microsoft may elect to discontinue the integration in the future. Microsoft might also promote or encourage or alternatively discourage these solutions through their field teams without any standardization. Our inability to provide some or all of our third-party integrations could cause customers to seek other solutions and would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 We rely on third-party software that may be difficult to replace or which could cause errors or failures of our subscriptions. 
 We rely on software licensed from certain third parties in order to offer our solutions. In some cases, we integrate third-party licensed software components into our platform. This software may not continue to be available at reasonable prices or on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of this software could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our solutions until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained, and integrated. Any errors or defects in third-party software could result in errors or a failure of our solutions, which could harm our business. 
 Interruptions or delays in service from our third-party data center hosting facilities and other third-party providers could impair the delivery of our subscriptions, require us to issue credits or pay penalties and harm our business. 
 We currently serve our North American customers from geographically disparate data center hosting facilities in North America, where we lease space from Equinix, Inc., and other providers, and we serve our European customers from third-party data center hosting facilities in Europe. We also use third-party co-location facilities located in various international regions to serve our customers in these regions. Certain of our solutions are hosted by third-party data center facilities including Amazon Web Services, Inc. AWS and Google Cloud Platform. Damage to, or failure of, these facilities, the communications network providers with whom we or they contract, or with the systems by which our communications providers allocate capacity among their customers, including us, or software errors, have in the past and could in the future result in interruptions in our services. Additionally, in connection with the addition of new data centers or expansion or consolidation of our existing data center facilities, we may move or transfer our data and our customers data to other data centers. Despite precautions that we take during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair or cause disruptions in the delivery of our subscriptions. Interruptions in our subscriptions may reduce our revenues, may require us to issue credits or pay penalties, subject us to claims and litigation, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new and retain existing customers. Our ability to attract and retain customers depends on our ability to provide customers with a highly reliable subscription and even minor interruptions in our subscriptions could harm our brand and reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 As part of our current disaster recovery arrangements, our North American, European, and Asia Pacific infrastructure and our North American, European, and Asia Pacific customers data is currently replicated in near real-time at data center facilities in the U.S., Europe, and Asia Pacific, respectively. We do not control the operation of these facilities or of our other data center facilities, and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, and similar events. They may also be subject to human error or to break-ins, sabotage, acts of vandalism, and similar misconduct. 
 Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster, public health crisis or pandemic, human error, cybersecurity incident, including ransomware or denial-of-service attack, an act of terrorism or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our subscriptions. Even with the disaster recovery arrangements in place, our subscriptions could be interrupted. 
 We may also be required to transfer our servers to new data center facilities in the event that we are unable to renew our leases on acceptable terms, if at all, or the owners of the facilities decide to close their facilities, and we may incur significant costs and possible subscription interruption in connection with doing so. In addition, any financial difficulties, such as bankruptcy or foreclosure, faced by our third-party data center operators, or any of the service providers with which we or they contract may have negative effects on our business, the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict. Additionally, if 
 49 

Table of Contents 

 our data centers are unable to keep up with our increasing needs for capacity, our ability to grow our business could be materially and adversely impacted. 
 We rely on third parties to fulfill various aspects of our E-911 service. If these third parties do not provide our customers with reliable, high-quality service, our reputation will be harmed, and we may lose customers. 
 We contract with third parties to provide emergency services calls in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., and other jurisdictions in which we provide access to emergency services dialing, including assistance in routing emergency calls and terminating emergency services calls. Our domestic providers operate a national call center that is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to receive certain emergency calls and maintain PSAP databases for the purpose of deploying and operating E-911 services. We rely on providers for similar functions in other jurisdictions in which we provide access to emergency services dialing. On mobile devices, we rely on the underlying cellular or wireless carrier to provide emergency services dialing. Interruptions in service from our vendors could cause failures in our customers access to E-911/999/112 services and expose us to liability and damage our reputation. 
 If these third parties do not provide reliable, high-quality service, or the service is not provided in compliance with regulatory requirements, our reputation and our business will be harmed. In addition, industry consolidation among providers of services to us may impact our ability to obtain these services or increase our costs for these services. 
 Failures in Internet infrastructure or interference with broadband access could cause current or potential users to believe that our systems are unreliable, possibly leading our customers to switch to our competitors or to avoid using our subscriptions. 
 Unlike traditional communications services, our subscriptions depend on our customers high-speed broadband access to the Internet. Increasing numbers of users and increasing bandwidth requirements may degrade the performance of our services and applications due to capacity constraints and other Internet infrastructure limitations. As our customer base grows and their usage of our services increases, we will likely be required to make additional investments in network capacity to maintain adequate data transmission speeds, the availability of which may be limited, or the cost of which may be on terms unacceptable to us. If adequate capacity is not available to us as our customers usage increases, our network may be unable to achieve or maintain sufficiently high reliability or performance. In addition, if Internet access service providers have outages or deteriorations in their quality of service, our customers will not have access to our subscriptions or may experience a decrease in the quality of our services. Frequent or persistent interruptions could cause current or potential users to believe that our systems or services are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our subscriptions, and could permanently harm our reputation and brands. 
 In addition, users who access our subscriptions and applications through mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, must have a high-speed connection, such as Wi-Fi , 4G, 5G, or LTE, to use our services and applications. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant and increasing market power in the broadband and Internet access marketplace, including incumbent phone companies, cable companies, and wireless companies. Some of these providers offer solutions and subscriptions that directly compete with our own offerings, which can potentially give them a competitive advantage. Also, these providers could take measures that degrade, disrupt or increase the cost of user access to third-party services, including our offerings, by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate third-party services or by charging increased fees to third parties or the users of third-party services, any of which would make our subscriptions less attractive to users, and reduce our revenues. 
 Interruptions in our services caused by undetected errors, failures, or bugs in our services could harm our reputation, result in significant costs to us, and impair our ability to sell our subscriptions. 
 Our services may have errors or defects that customers identify after they begin using them that could result in unanticipated interruptions of service. Internet-based services frequently contain undetected errors and bugs when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. While the substantial majority of our customers are small and medium-sized businesses, the use of our services in complicated, large-scale network environments may increase our exposure to undetected errors, failures, or bugs in our services. Although we test our services to detect and correct errors and defects before their general release, we have, from time to time, experienced significant interruptions in our services as a result of such errors or defects and may experience future interruptions of service if we fail to detect and correct these errors and defects. The costs incurred in correcting such defects or errors may be substantial and could harm our results of operations. In addition, we rely on hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties to offer our services.

 Any defects in, or unavailability of, our or third-party software or hardware that cause interruptions of our services could, among other things: 
 cause a reduction in revenues or a delay in market acceptance of our services; 
 require us to pay penalties or issue credits or refunds to our customers, channel partners, strategic partners, or global service providers, or expose us to claims for damages; 
 cause us to lose existing customers and make it more difficult to attract new customers; 
 divert our development resources or require us to make extensive changes to our software, which would increase our expenses and slow innovation; 
 increase our technical support costs; 
 harm our reputation and brand; and 
 result in litigation and regulatory action against the company. 
 A security incident, such as a cyber-attack, information security breach or denial of service event could delay or interrupt service to our customers, harm our reputation or business, impact our subscriptions, and subject us to significant liability. 
 Our operations depend on our ability to protect our production and corporate information technology services from interruption or damage from cyber-attacks, denial-of-service events, social engineering data breaches, unauthorized entry, insider threats, rogue employees or contractors, computer malware or other security incidents, including events beyond our control. Although we require our employees to undertake privacy and cybersecurity training, we have from time to time been subject to communications fraud, social engineering tactics, cyber-attacks by malicious actors, and denial of service events, and we may be subject to similar attacks in the future, particularly as the frequency and sophistication of cyber-attacks increases. For example, cybersecurity researchers have warned of a potential increase in cyber-attack activity in connection with the war between Russia and Ukraine. We cannot assure you that our backup systems, regular data backups, security controls, personnel training, and other procedures currently in place, or that may be in place in the future, will prevent significant damage, system failure, service outages, data incidents, data loss, unauthorized access, loss of use, interruption, or increased charges from our technology vendors. 
 Also, our services are web-based. The amount of data we store for our customers and users increases as our business grows. We host services, which includes hosting customer data, both in co-located data centers and in multiple public cloud services. Our solutions allow users to store files, tasks, calendar events, messages and other data on our services indefinitely or as may be directed by our customers, at least until termination of the agreement. We also maintain sensitive data related to our technology and business, and that of our employees, strategic partners, global service providers, channel partners, and customers, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personally identifiable information (also called personal data) on our own systems and in multiple vendors cloud services. As a result of maintaining larger volumes of data and user files and/or as a result of our continued movement up market, or movement into new customer segments and acquisition of larger and more recognized customers, we may become more of a target for hackers, nation states and other malicious actors. 
 In addition, we use third-party vendors who, in some cases, have access to our data and our employees , partners , and customers data. We employ layered security measures and have a means of working with third parties who report vulnerabilities to us. Despite the implementation of security measures by us or our vendors, our computing devices, infrastructure, or networks, or our vendors computing devices, infrastructure, or networks have in the past, and may in the future, be vulnerable to hackers, computer viruses, worms, ransomware, other malicious software programs, employee theft or misuse, phishing, denial-of-service attacks, or similar disruptive problems that are caused by or through a security weakness or vulnerability in our or our vendors infrastructure, network, or business practices or our or our vendors customers, employees, business partners, consultants, or other Internet users who attempt to invade our or our vendors corporate and personal computers, tablets, mobile devices, software, data networks, or voice networks. Security weaknesses or vulnerabilities in our, our vendors , or our customers infrastructure, networks, or business practices that are successfully targeted could lead to increased costs, liability claims, including contractual liability claims relating to security obligations in agreements with our partners and our customers, fines, claims, investigations and other proceedings, reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position. In addition, even if not targeted, in strengthening our security controls or in remediating security vulnerabilities, we could incur increased costs and capital expenditures. 
 We have implemented remote working protocols and offer work-issued devices to certain employees, but the actions of employees while working remotely may have a greater effect on the security of our infrastructure, networks, and the 
 51 

Table of Contents 

 information, including personally identifiable information, we process, including for example by increasing the risk of compromise to systems or data arising from employees combined personal and private use of devices, accessing our networks or information using wireless networks that we do not control, or the ability to transmit or store company-controlled information outside of our secured network. Although many of these risks are not unique to the remote working environment, they have been heightened by the dramatic increase in the numbers of our employees who have been and are continuing to work from home since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also currently allow a substantial number of our employees to work from home some or all of the time, although we may change our work from home/return-to-office policy in the future. Our employees or third parties intentional, unintentional, or inadvertent actions may increase our vulnerability or expose us to security threats, such as ransomware, other malware and phishing attacks, and we may remain responsible for unauthorized access to, loss, alteration, destruction, acquisition, disclosure or other processing of information we or our vendors, business partners, or consultants process or otherwise maintain, even if the security measures used to protect such information comply with applicable laws, regulations and other actual or asserted obligations. Additionally, due to political uncertainty and military actions and related activities associated with the war between Russia and Ukraine and the conflicts in the Middle East, we and our vendors, business partners, and consultants are vulnerable to heightened risks of cyber-attacks from nation-state actors or their affiliated entities, including attacks that could materially disrupt our systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute our services. Also, cyber-attacks, including on the supply chain (including our software supply chain), continue to increase in frequency and magnitude, and we cannot provide assurances that our preventative efforts, or those of our suppliers, will be successful. 
 We rely on encryption and authentication technology to ensure secure transmission of and access to confidential information, including customer credit card numbers, debit card numbers, direct debit information, customer communications, and files uploaded by our customers. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, discovery of software bugs or vulnerabilities, discovery of hardware bugs or vulnerabilities, social engineering activities, or other developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology we use to protect our data and our customer data, or of the data itself. We also have incorporated AI-powered features into our solutions and may continue to incorporate additional AI features and technologies into our solutions in the future. Our use of AI features and technologies may create additional cybersecurity risks or increase cybersecurity risks, including risks of security breaches and incidents. Further, AI technologies may be used in connection with certain cybersecurity attacks, resulting in heightened risks of security breaches and incidents. 
 Additionally, third parties have in the past successfully induced, and may attempt in the future to induce using social engineering or other methods, domestic and international employees, consultants, or customers into disclosing sensitive information, such as usernames, provisioning data, customer proprietary network information CPNI or other information in order to gain access to our customers user accounts or data, or to our data. CPNI includes information such as the phone numbers called by a customer, the frequency, duration, and timing of such calls, and any services purchased by the consumer, such as call waiting, call forwarding, and caller ID, in addition to other information that may appear on a customer s bill. Third parties may also attempt to induce employees, consultants, or customers into disclosing information regarding our and our customers intellectual property, personal data and other confidential business information. In addition, the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, to perform hacking, phishing and social engineering, or to sabotage systems change and evolve frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, may be new and previously unknown or little-known, or may not be detected or understood until well after such actions are conducted. We may be unable to anticipate all of these techniques and therefore may be unsuccessful in implementing appropriate preventative measures, and any security breach or other incident may take longer than expected to remediate or otherwise address. Any system failure or security breach or incident that causes interruptions or data loss in our operations or in the computer systems of our customers or leads to the misappropriation of our or our customers confidential or personal information could result in significant liability to us, loss of our intellectual property, cause our subscriptions to be perceived as not being secure, cause considerable harm to us and our reputation (including requiring notification to customers, regulators, or the media), and deter current and potential customers from using our subscriptions. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 It is critical to our business that our sensitive information and that of our employees , strategic partners , global service providers , channel partners and customers remains secure and that our customers perceive that this information is secure. An information security incident could result in unauthorized access to, loss of, or unauthorized disclosure of such information. A cybersecurity breach or incident could expose us to litigation, indemnity obligations, government notification and investigations, contractual liability, and other possible liabilities. Additionally, a cyber-attack or other information security incident, whether actual or perceived, could result in negative publicity, which could harm our reputation and reduce our customers confidence in the effectiveness of our solutions, which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. A breach of our security systems could also expose us to increased costs, including remediation costs, disruption of operations, or increased cybersecurity protection costs, that may have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, a cybersecurity breach or incident of our customers systems can also result in exposure of their authentication 
 52 

Table of Contents 

 credentials, unauthorized access to their accounts, exposure of their account information and data (including CPNI), and fraudulent calls on their accounts, which can subsequently have similar actual or perceived impacts to us as described above. A cybersecurity breach or incident of our partners or vendors systems can result in similar actual or perceived impacts. 
 While we maintain cybersecurity insurance, our insurance may be insufficient to cover all liabilities incurred by privacy or security incidents. We also cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient for data handling or data security liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that an insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results, and reputation. 
 Laws, regulations, and enforcement actions relating to security and privacy of information continue to evolve. For example, in 2023, the SEC adopted cybersecurity risk management and disclosure rules, which require the disclosure of information pertaining to cybersecurity incidents and cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance. Additionally, we are closely monitoring the development of rules and guidance that may apply to us, including, for example, pursuant to the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022. The Federal Communications Commission FCC formed the Privacy and Data Protection Task Force that focuses on approaches to data breaches and data security vulnerabilities, which may result in future privacy rulemaking and enforcement initiatives. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant expenses to prevent security incidents. Determining whether a cybersecurity incident is notifiable or reportable may not be straightforward and may be costly and could lead to negative publicity, loss of customer or partner confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures, diversion of management s attention, governmental investigations, and the expenditure of significant capital and other resources to respond to or alleviate problems caused by the actual or perceived security breach. It is possible that, in order to support changes to applicable laws and to support our expansion of sales into new geographic areas or into new industry segments, we will need to change or enhance our cybersecurity systems, which may make it more expensive to operate in certain jurisdictions and may also increase the risk of our non-compliance with such changing laws and regulations. 
 Potential problems with our information systems could interfere with our business and operations. 
 We rely on our information systems and those of third parties for processing customer orders, distribution of our subscriptions, billing our customers, processing credit card transactions, customer relationship management, supporting financial planning and analysis, accounting functions and financial statement preparation, and otherwise running our business. Information systems may experience interruptions, including interruptions of related services from third-party providers, which may be beyond our control. Such business interruptions could cause us to fail to meet customer requirements. All information systems, both internal and external, are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches and incidents, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures, employee or other theft, and third-party provider failures. In addition, since telecommunications billing is inherently complex and requires highly sophisticated information systems to administer, our internally developed billing system may experience errors or we may improperly operate the system, which could result in the system incorrectly calculating the fees owed by our customers for our subscriptions or related taxes and administrative fees. Any such errors in our customer billing could harm our reputation and cause us to violate truth in billing laws and regulations. Our current internally developed billing system requires us to process an increasing number of invoices manually, which could result in billing errors. Any errors or disruption in our information systems and those of the third parties upon which we rely could have a significant impact on our business. In addition, we may implement further and enhanced information systems in the future to meet the demands resulting from our growth and to provide additional capabilities and functionality. The implementation of new systems and enhancements is frequently disruptive to the underlying business of an enterprise, and can be time-consuming and expensive, increase management responsibilities, and divert management attention. 
 We depend largely on the continued services of our senior management and other highly-skilled employees, and if we are unable to hire, retain, manage and motivate our employees, we may not be able to grow effectively and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 Our future performance depends on the continued services and contributions of our senior management and other key employees to execute on our business plan, and to identify and pursue opportunities and services innovations. The loss of services of senior management or other key employees, whether in the past or in the future, could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business, financial, developmental and strategic objectives. In particular, we depend to a considerable degree on the vision, skills, experience, and effort of our co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Vladimir 
 53 

Table of Contents 

 Shmunis, who has provided our strategic direction for over 20 years and has built and maintained what we believe is an attractive workplace culture. Any future changes resulting from the hiring or departure of executives, could disrupt our business and could impact our ability to preserve our culture, which could negatively affect our ability to recruit and retain personnel. None of our executive officers or other senior management personnel is bound by a written employment agreement and any of them may therefore terminate employment with us at any time with limited or no advance notice. The replacement of any current or future senior management personnel could involve significant time and costs, and any such loss could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives. 
 Our future success also depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. Despite many recent layoffs in the technology industry and at the company, we believe that there is, and will continue to be, intense competition for highly skilled technical and other personnel with experience in our industry in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters is located, in Denver, Colorado, where a significant portion of our U.S. sales and customer support office and our network operations center is located, and in other locations where we maintain offices, and in some or all of the other locations where we have employees. In addition, changes to U.S. immigration policies, particularly to H-1B and other visa programs, and restrictions on travel could restrain the flow of technical and professional talent into the U.S. and may inhibit our ability to hire qualified personnel. Similar risks exist with respect to immigration regulations in other countries where we operate, may operate in the future or have employees or contractors. We must provide competitive compensation packages and a high-quality work environment to hire, retain, and motivate employees. If we are unable to retain and motivate our existing employees and attract qualified personnel to fill key positions, we may be unable to manage our business effectively, including the development, marketing, and sale of existing and new subscriptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. To the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or divulged proprietary or other confidential information. Volatility in, or lack of performance of, our stock price may also affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel. 
 Increased customer turnover, or costs we incur to retain and upsell our customers, could materially and adversely affect our financial performance. 
 Although we have entered into long-term subscription contracts with larger customers, those customers with month to month contracts with us may terminate their subscriptions at any time without penalty or early termination charges and customers under contract may not renew. We cannot accurately predict the rate of customer terminations or average monthly subscription cancellations or failures to renew, which we refer to as turnover. Our customers with subscription agreements have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period, which is typically between one and three years, and a substantial portion of our large contracts are up for renewal every year. In the event that these customers do renew their subscriptions, they may choose to renew for fewer users, shorter contract lengths, or for a less expensive subscription plan or edition. We cannot predict the renewal rates or types for customers that have entered into subscription contracts with us. 
 Customer turnover, as well as reductions in the number of users or pricing tier(s) for which a customer subscribes, each could have a significant impact on our results of operations, as does the cost we incur in our efforts to retain our customers and encourage them to renew and upgrade their subscriptions and increase their number of users. Our turnover rate could increase in the future if customers are not satisfied with our services, including third-party services and products that we integrate or sell as separate items to our customers, the value proposition of our services, the pricing of our services relative to similar services of our competitors, the customer support we provide, or our ability to otherwise meet their needs and expectations. Turnover and reductions in the number of users for whom a customer subscribes may also increase due to factors beyond our control, including the failure or unwillingness of customers to pay their monthly subscription fees due to financial constraints and the impact of a slowing economy and higher interest rates. In addition, the impact of the global economic conditions, including concerns about heightened inflation and an associated economic downturn, and instability in the banking and financial system, could cause financial hardship for our customers, decrease technology spending, materially and negatively impact our customers willingness to enter into or renew subscriptions with us, cause our customers to seek a decrease in the number of users or solutions for which they subscribe, or impact our ability to collect, in a timely manner, monies due from the customer. For example, to address customer hardships, we may work with customers to provide greater flexibility to manage challenges they are facing in their own businesses, but we cannot be assured that they will not reduce their number of users or terminate their subscriptions altogether. Due to turnover and reductions in the number of users for whom a customer subscribes, we must acquire new customers, or acquire new users within our existing customer base, on an ongoing basis simply to maintain our existing level of customers and revenues. If a significant number of customers terminate, reduce, or fail to renew their subscriptions, or do not pay their subscription fees, we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing and/or sales expenditures than we currently anticipate in order to compensate for this higher turnover by increasing the number of new 
 54 

Table of Contents 

 customers or upselling existing customers, and such additional marketing and/or sales expenditures could harm our business and results of operations. 
 Our future success also depends in part on our ability to execute upon our multi-product strategy to sell additional subscriptions and additional functionalities to our current customers. Any increase in the costs necessary to upgrade, expand and retain existing customers could materially and adversely affect our financial performance. If our efforts to convince customers to add users and, in the future, to purchase additional functionalities are not successful, our business may suffer. In addition, such increased costs could cause us to increase our subscription rates, which could increase our turnover rate. 
 If we are unable to attract new customers to our subscriptions or upsell to those customers on a cost-effective basis, our business will be materially and adversely affected. 
 In order to grow our business, we must continue to attract new customers, retain existing customers, and expand the number of users in, and services provided to, our existing customer base on a cost-effective basis. We use and periodically adjust the mix of advertising and marketing programs to promote our services. Significant increases in the pricing of one or more of our advertising channels would increase our advertising costs or may cause us to choose less expensive and perhaps less effective channels to promote our services. As we add to or change the mix of our advertising and marketing strategies, we may need to expand into channels with significantly higher costs than our current programs, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, a global slowdown of economic activity may disrupt our sales channels and our ability to attract new customers, which may require us to adjust our advertising and marketing programs or make further investments in these programs. We will incur advertising and marketing expenses in advance of when we anticipate recognizing any revenues generated by such expenses, and we may fail to otherwise experience an increase in revenues or brand awareness as a result of such expenditures. We have made in the past, and may make in the future, significant expenditures and investments in new advertising campaigns, and we cannot assure you that any such investments will lead to the cost-effective acquisition of additional customers. If we are unable to maintain effective advertising programs, our ability to attract new customers could be materially and adversely affected, our advertising and marketing expenses could increase substantially, and our results of operations may suffer. 
 Some of our potential customers learn about us through leading search engines, such as Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft Bing. While we employ search engine optimization and search engine marketing strategies, our ability to maintain and increase the number of visitors directed to our website is not entirely within our control. If search engine companies modify their search algorithms in a manner that reduces the prominence of our listing, or if our competitors search engine optimization efforts are more successful than ours, or if search engine companies restrict or prohibit us from using their services, fewer potential customers may click through to our website. In addition, the cost of purchased listings has increased in the past and may increase in the future. A decrease in website traffic or an increase in search costs could materially and adversely affect our customer acquisition efforts and our results of operations. 
 A significant portion of our revenues today come from small and medium-sized businesses, which may have fewer financial resources to weather an economic downturn. 
 A significant portion of our revenues today come from small and medium-sized businesses. These customers may be materially and adversely affected by economic downturns to a greater extent than larger, more established businesses. These businesses typically have more limited financial resources, including capital-borrowing capacity, than larger entities. Any economic downturn could decrease technology spending and the number of employees of small and medium sized businesses in ways that adversely affect demand for our offerings, could increase churn or down-sell and harm our business and results of operations. As the majority of our customers pay for our subscriptions through credit and debit cards, weakness in certain segments of the credit markets and in the U.S. and global economies may in the future result in increased numbers of rejected credit and debit card payments, which could materially affect our business by increasing customer cancellations and impacting our ability to engage new small and medium-sized customers. If small and medium-sized businesses experience financial hardship as a result of a weak economy, industry consolidation or for any other reason, the overall demand for our subscriptions could be materially and adversely affected. 
 We face significant risks in our strategy to target medium-sized and larger businesses for sales of our subscriptions and, if we do not manage these efforts effectively, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
 As we continue to target more of our sales efforts to medium-sized and larger businesses, we expect to incur higher costs and longer sales cycles and we may be less effective at predicting if and when we will complete these sales. In these 
 55 

Table of Contents 

 market segments, the decision to purchase our subscriptions generally requires the approval of more technical personnel and management levels within a potential customer s organization, and therefore, these types of sales require us to invest more time educating these potential customers about the benefits of our subscriptions. In addition, larger customers may demand more features, integration services, customization, more complex contract negotiations, and may require highly skilled sales and support personnel. Our investment in marketing our subscriptions to these potential customers may not be successful, which could significantly and adversely affect our results of operations and our overall ability to grow our customer base. Furthermore, many medium-sized and larger businesses that we target for sales may already purchase business communications solutions from our larger competitors or, due to economic conditions or otherwise, reduce their technology spending or reduce the number of new employees for whom they purchase our solutions or reduce the number of existing employees using our solution (i.e., down-sell). As a result of these factors, these medium and large sales opportunities may require us to devote greater research and development resources and sales support to individual customers, and invest in hiring and retaining highly skilled personnel, resulting in increased costs and could likely lengthen our typical sales cycle, which could strain our sales and support resources. Moreover, these larger transactions may require us to delay recognizing the associated revenues we derive from these customers until any technical or implementation requirements have been met. 
 Support for smartphones and tablets are an integral part of our solutions. If we are unable to develop robust mobile applications that operate on the mobile platforms that our customers use, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
 Our solutions allow our customers to use and manage our cloud-based business communications solution on smart devices. As new smart devices and operating systems are released, we may encounter difficulties supporting these devices and services. We also need to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of our mobile applications. In addition, if we experience difficulties in the future integrating our mobile applications into smart devices or if problems arise with our relationships with providers of mobile operating systems, such as those of Apple Inc. or Alphabet Inc., our future growth and our results of operations could suffer. 
 Third-party application stores may also impose new requirements, including, for example, updates to their terms of access or policies on how we or our channel partners must collect, use and share data. Compliance with any such requirements could be costly or burdensome, and could prevent us from timely updating our current solutions or uploading new solutions. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could lose access to, or be required to remove our mobile applications from, third-party application stores. 
 If we are unable to develop, license, or acquire new services or applications on a timely and cost-effective basis, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 
 The cloud-based business communications industry is characterized by rapid development of and changes in customer requirements, frequent introductions of new and enhanced services, and continuing and rapid technological advancement. We cannot predict the effect of technological changes or the introduction of new, disruptive technologies on our business, and the market for cloud-based business communications may develop more slowly than we anticipate, or develop in a manner different than we expect, and our solutions could fail to achieve market acceptance. Our continued growth depends on continued use of voice, video communications, AI and messaging by businesses, as compared to email and other data-based methods, and future demand for and adoption of Internet voice, video communications, AI and messaging systems and services. In addition, to compete successfully, we must anticipate and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards, and continue to design, develop, manufacture, and sell new and enhanced services that provide increasingly higher levels of performance and reliability. Currently, we derive a majority of our revenues from subscriptions to RingEX (formerly RingCentral MVP), and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future. However, our future success may also depend on our ability to introduce and sell new services, features, and functionality, such as RingCX, RingSense and RingCentral Events that enhance or are beyond the subscriptions we currently offer, as well as to improve usability and support and increase customer satisfaction. For example, we and our peers and competitors are investing more significantly in AI (including machine learning and large language models). There are significant risks involved in deploying AI and there can be no assurance that using AI in our platforms and products, such as our AI-powered feature, RingSense, will enhance or be beneficial to our business, including our profitability. Our failure to develop solutions that satisfy customer preferences in a timely and cost-effective manner may harm our ability to compete effectively, renew our subscriptions with existing customers, increase our subscription revenues from our existing customers, and create or increase demand for our subscriptions and may materially and adversely impact our results of operations. 
 The introduction of new services by competitors, including those that incorporate AI and machine learning, or the development of entirely new technologies to replace existing offerings could make our solutions outdated, obsolete or adversely 
 56 

Table of Contents 

 affect our business and results of operations. Announcements of future releases and new services and technologies by our competitors or us could cause customers to defer purchases of our existing subscriptions, which also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may experience difficulties with software development, operations, design, or marketing that could delay or prevent our development, introduction, or implementation of new or enhanced services and applications. We have in the past experienced delays in the planned release dates of new features and upgrades and have discovered defects in new services and applications after their introduction. We cannot assure you that new features or upgrades will be released according to schedule, or that, when released, they will not contain defects or bugs. Either of these situations could result in adverse publicity, loss of revenues, delay in market acceptance, or claims by customers brought against us, all of which could harm our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. Moreover, the development of new or enhanced services or applications will require substantial investment, and we must continue to invest a significant amount of resources in our research and development efforts to develop these services and applications to remain competitive. We do not know whether these investments will be successful. If customers do not widely adopt any new or enhanced services and applications, we may not be able to realize a return on our investment. If we are unable to develop, license, or acquire new or enhanced services and applications on a timely and cost-effective basis, or if such new or enhanced services and applications do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 
 The AI technology and features incorporated into our solutions include new and evolving technologies that may present both legal and business risks. 
 We have incorporated a number of AI-powered features, including RingSense, into our solutions and are making investments in expanding our AI capabilities. AI technologies are complex and rapidly evolving, and we face significant competition from other companies as well as an evolving legal and regulatory landscape. The successful integration of new and emerging AI technologies, such as generative AI, automated speech recognition (ASR), text-to-speech (TTS) and natural language processing (NLP) into our platforms and solutions will require additional investment, and the development of new approaches and processes, which will be costly and increase our expenses. 
 Further, the incorporation of AI-powered features into our solutions will subject us to new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, confidentiality or security risks, ethical concerns, or other complications that could harm our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. Intellectual property ownership and license rights, including copyright, surrounding AI technologies are new, evolving, and have not been fully addressed by federal or state laws or by U.S. courts, and the manner in which we configure and use AI technologies may expose us to claims of copyright infringement or other intellectual property misappropriation. Many existing state privacy laws, which regulate automated decision making, apply to AI, and the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Department of Justice, and other federal agencies have issued a joint statement noting that existing legal authorities apply to the use of automated systems and innovative new technologies. More recently, the FCC applied restrictions in the TCPA on AI-generated voices. Several state legislatures are considering regulation of AI, and Colorado has enacted comprehensive AI legislation focusing on automated decision-making systems. It is possible that new laws and regulations will be adopted in the United States and in other countries, or that existing laws and regulations, such as the European Union s recently adopted AI Act (the EU AI Act ), will be interpreted in ways that would affect the operation of our solution and the way in which we use AI. In addition, the cost to comply with such laws or regulations could be significant and would increase our operating expenses, which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Relatedly, large language models, or LLMs, can generate written content that contains bias, factual errors, misrepresentations, offensive language, or inappropriate statements. While we attempt to use LLMs in a way that mitigates these risks, there is no guarantee that we will be successful and these risks could harm our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. 
 In addition, the use of AI involves significant technical complexity and requires specialized expertise, and competition for specialized personnel in the AI industry is intense. Any disruption or failure in our AI systems or infrastructure could result in delays or errors in our operations, which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The use of AI by our workforce may present risks to our business. 
 Our workforce is exposed to and uses AI technologies for certain tasks related to our business. We have guidelines and policies specifically directed at the use of AI tools in the workplace. Nevertheless, the use of these AI tools, whether authorized or unauthorized, by our workforce, poses potential risks relating to the protection of data, including cybersecurity risk, exposure of our proprietary confidential information to unauthorized recipients, and the misuse of our or third-party intellectual property.

Table of Contents 

 Use of AI technology by our workforce, even when used consistent with our guidelines, may result in allegations or claims against us related to violation of third-party intellectual property rights, unauthorized access to or use of proprietary information, and failure to comply with open source software requirements. In addition, our employees use AI tools for various design and engineering tasks such as writing code and building content, and these AI technology tools may produce inaccurate responses that could lead to errors in our decision-making, solution development or other business activities, which could have a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Our ability to mitigate these risks will depend on our continued effective training, monitoring and enforcement of appropriate policies, guidelines and procedures governing the use of AI technology, and compliance by our workforce. 
 If we fail to continue to develop our brand or our reputation is harmed, our business may suffer. 
 We believe that continuing to strengthen our current brand will be critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our subscriptions and will require continued focus on active marketing efforts. The demand for and cost of online and traditional advertising has been increasing and may continue to increase. Accordingly, we may need to increase our investment in, and devote greater resources to, advertising, marketing, and other efforts to create and maintain brand loyalty among users. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenues, and even if they do, any increased revenues may not offset the expenses incurred in building our brand. In addition, if we do not handle customer complaints effectively, our brand and reputation may suffer, we may lose our customers confidence, and they may choose to terminate, reduce or not to renew their subscriptions. Many of our customers also participate in social media and online blogs about Internet-based software solutions, including our subscriptions, and our success depends in part on our ability to minimize negative and generate positive customer feedback through such online channels where existing and potential customers seek and share information. If we fail to sufficiently invest in, promote and maintain our brand, our business could be materially and adversely affected. 
 If we experience excessive fraudulent activity or cannot meet evolving credit card association merchant standards, we could incur substantial costs and lose the right to accept credit cards for payment, which could cause our customer base, new sales, and revenues to decline significantly. 
 Most of our customers authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly for service fees that we charge. If customers pay for our subscriptions with stolen credit cards, we could incur substantial third-party vendor costs for which we may not be reimbursed. Further, our customers provide us with credit card billing information online or over the phone, and we do not review the physical credit cards used in these transactions, which increases our risk of exposure to fraudulent activity. We also incur charges, which are referred to in the industry as chargebacks, from the credit card companies from claims that a customer did not authorize the specific credit card transaction to purchase our subscription. If the number of chargebacks becomes excessive, we could be assessed substantial fines or be charged higher transaction fees, and we could lose the right to accept credit cards for payment. In addition, credit card issuers may change merchant and/or service provider standards, including data protection standards, required to utilize their services from time to time. We have established and implemented measures intended to comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard PCI DSS ). If we fail to maintain compliance with such standards or fail to meet new standards, the credit card associations could fine us or terminate their agreements with us, and we would be unable to accept credit cards as payment for our subscriptions. If we fail to maintain compliance with current service provider standards, such as the PCI DSS, or fail to meet new standards, customers may choose not to use our services. If such a failure to comply with relevant standards occurs, we may also face legal liability if we are found to not comply with applicable laws that incorporate, by reference or by adoption of substantially similar provisions, merchant or service provider standards, including the PCI DSS. Our subscriptions may also be subject to fraudulent usage, including but not limited to revenue share fraud, domestic traffic pumping, subscription fraud, premium text message scams, and other fraudulent schemes. This usage can result in, among other things, substantial bills from our vendors, for which we would be responsible, for terminating fraudulent call traffic. In addition, third parties may have attempted in the past, and may attempt in the future, to induce employees, sub-contractors, or consultants into disclosing customer credentials and other account information using social engineering and other methods, which can result in unauthorized access to customer accounts and customer data, unauthorized use of customers services, charges to customers for fraudulent usage and costs that we must pay to global service providers. Although we have implemented multiple fraud prevention, detection controls and personnel trainings, we cannot assure you that these controls will be adequate to protect against fraud. Substantial losses due to fraud or our inability to accept credit card payments could cause our paid customer base to significantly decrease, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and ability to grow our business.

 Our international operations and customer base may expose us to significant risks. 
 We have significant operations directly or through third parties in many countries outside of the U.S. and Canada, including, the U.K., China, the Philippines, Germany, Georgia, Bulgaria, Spain, Australia, India, and France. We also sell our solutions to customers in several countries in Europe, as well as in the Asia Pacific region, including Australia, India, and Singapore and we may continue to grow our international presence in the future. The future success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to expand our operations and customer base worldwide, as well as our ability to acquire and maintain international customers in a cost effective manner. Operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory, economic, and political risks that are different from those in the U.S. Due to our limited experience with international operations and developing and managing sales and distribution channels in international markets, our international expansion efforts may not be successful. In addition, we will face risks in doing business internationally that could materially and adversely affect our business, including: 
 our ability to comply with differing and evolving technical and environmental standards, telecommunications regulations, and certification requirements outside the U.S.; 
 difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations; 
 our ability to effectively price our subscriptions in competitive international markets; 
 potentially greater difficulty collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles; 
 the need to adapt and localize our subscriptions and product offerings for specific countries and local regulators; 
 the need to offer customer care, product information, websites, and other marketing collateral in various native languages; 
 the need to contract and bill in various native languages, currencies, and under a variety of different legal systems; 
 reliance on third parties over which we have limited control, including those that market and resell our subscriptions in international markets; 
 availability of reliable broadband connectivity and wide area networks in targeted areas for expansion; 
 lower levels of adoption of credit or debit card usage for Internet related purchases by foreign customers and compliance with various foreign regulations related to credit or debit card processing and data protection requirements; 
 difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations, and customs in foreign jurisdictions, including with respect to foreign labor laws and regulations, which may adversely affect our ability to manage our headcount and the cost of our foreign work force; 
 restrictions on travel to or from countries in which we operate or inability to access certain areas; 
 export controls and economic sanctions; changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, including tariffs and other non-tariff barriers, such as quotas and local content rules; 
 U.S. government and applicable foreign trade restrictions, including those which may impose restrictions, including prohibitions, on the exportation, re-exportation, sale, shipment or other transfer of programming, technology, components, and/or services to foreign persons; 
 our ability to comply with different and evolving laws, rules, and regulations, including the European General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR ), and other data privacy and data protection laws, rules and regulations; 
 compliance with various anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and U.K. Bribery Act of 2010; 
 more limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; 
 adverse tax consequences; 
 fluctuations in currency exchange rates; 
 exchange control regulations, which might restrict or prohibit our conversion of other currencies into U.S. dollars; 
 restrictions on the transfer of funds; 
 59

 new and different sources of competition; 
 natural disasters or global health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; 
 deterioration of political relations between the U.S. and other countries where we have personnel who support our business, particularly China, India, Bulgaria, Spain, and the Philippines; and 
 political or social unrest, economic instability, conflict or war in such countries, or sanctions implemented by the U.S. against these countries, such as the ongoing geopolitical tensions related to the war between Russia and Ukraine, and resulting sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other countries, and retaliatory actions taken by Russia in response to such sanctions, as well as the conflicts in the Middle East, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. 
 Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our future international operations and our overall business. 
 We may expand through acquisitions of, investments in, GSPs or other strategic transactions with, other companies, each of which may divert our management s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders, increase expenses, disrupt our operations, and harm our results of operations. 
 Our business strategy may, from time to time, include acquiring or investing in new or complementary services, technologies or businesses, strategic investments and partnerships, or other strategic transactions, such as our investment in and partnerships with our global service providers such as AT T, BT, Vodafone, and Charter Communications, Inc. We cannot assure you that we will successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates or transaction counterparties, securely or effectively integrate or manage disparate technologies, lines of business, personnel and corporate cultures, realize our business strategy or the expected return on our investment, or manage a geographically dispersed company. Any such acquisition, investment, strategic partnership, or other strategic transaction could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. The process of negotiating, effecting, and realizing the benefits from acquisitions, investments, strategic partnerships, and strategic transactions is complex, expensive and time-consuming, and may cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, development and sales activities and operations of both companies, and we may incur substantial cost and expense, as well as divert the attention of management. We may issue equity securities which could dilute current stockholders ownership, incur debt, assume contingent or other liabilities and expend cash in acquisitions, investments, strategic partnerships, and other strategic transactions which could negatively impact our financial position, stockholder equity, and stock price. 
 Acquisitions, investments, strategic partnerships, and other strategic transactions involve significant risks and uncertainties, including: 
 the potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the acquisition, investment, strategic partnership, or other strategic transaction, including recoupment or write-down of our investments in the partnership; 
 unanticipated costs and liabilities; 
 difficulties in integrating new solutions and subscriptions, software, businesses, operations, and technology infrastructure in an efficient and effective manner; 
 difficulties in maintaining and effectively servicing the customers acquired in the transaction; 
 the potential loss of key employees of any acquired businesses; 
 the diversion of the attention of our senior management from the operation of our daily business; 
 the potential adverse effect on our cash position to the extent that we use cash for some or all of the transaction consideration; 
 the potential significant increase of our interest expense, leverage, and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition, investment, strategic partnership, or other strategic transaction; 
 the potential issuance of securities that would dilute our stockholders percentage ownership; 
 the potential to incur large and immediate write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses; 
 the potential liability or expenses associated with new types of data stored, existing security obligations or liabilities, unknown weaknesses in our solutions, insufficient security measures in place, and compromise of our networks via access to our systems from assets not previously under our control; 
 the inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, policies, and procedures; and 
 60 

Table of Contents 

 the inability to set up the necessary processes and systems to efficiently operate our partnerships and GSP relationships. 
 Any acquisition, investment, strategic partnership, or other strategic transaction could expose us to unknown liabilities. Moreover, we cannot assure you that we will realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, investment, strategic partnership, or other strategic transaction. In addition, our inability to successfully operate and integrate newly acquired businesses or newly formed strategic partnerships appropriately, effectively, and in a timely manner could impair our ability to take advantage of future growth opportunities and other advances in technology, as well as our revenues and gross margins. 
 We may be subject to liabilities on past sales for taxes, surcharges, and fees and our operating results may be harmed if we are required to collect such amounts in jurisdictions where we have not historically done so. 
 We believe we collect state and local sales tax and use, excise, utility user, and ad valorem taxes, fees, or surcharges in all relevant jurisdictions in which we generate sales, based on our understanding of the applicable laws in those jurisdictions. Such tax, fees and surcharge laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction, and the application of such taxes to e-commerce businesses, such as ours, is complex and continuing to develop. There is uncertainty as to what constitutes sufficient in state presence for a state to levy taxes, fees, and surcharges for sales made over the Internet, and after the U.S. Supreme Court s ruling in South Dakota v. Wayfair , U.S. states may require an online retailer with no in-state property or personnel to collect and remit sales tax on sales to the state s residents, which may permit wider enforcement of sales tax collection requirements. Therefore, the application of existing or future laws relating to indirect taxes to our business, or the audit of our business and operations with respect to such taxes or challenges of our positions by taxing authorities, all could result in increased tax liabilities for us or our customers that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our relationships with our customers. Further, we have in the past and may in the future be audited by federal, state, and local tax authorities which could lead to liabilities for past unpaid taxes, fines, and penalties. 
 We may be unable to use some or all of our net operating loss and research credit carryforwards, which could materially and adversely affect our reported financial condition and results of operations. 
 As of December 31, 2023, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards NOLs of 1.8 billion, of which 66.1 million are set to expire in 2037, while the remaining portion does not expire. Additionally, we have state net operating loss carryforwards of 1.3 billion that began to expire in 2024. We also have federal research tax credit carryforwards that will begin to expire in 2028. Realization of these net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards depends on future income, and there is a risk that our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect our reported financial condition and results of operations. 
 In addition to the potential carryforward limitations described above, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code ), as amended, our ability to utilize NOLs or other tax attributes, such as research tax credits, in any taxable year may be limited if we experience an ownership change. An ownership change generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders, who each own at least 5 of our stock, increase their collective ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. In addition, California recently enacted legislation that suspends the use of NOLs for taxable years 2024, 2025 and 2026, which may adversely affect our company if it earns taxable income in the impacted tax years. 
 No material deferred tax assets have been recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheets related to these NOLs, as they are fully offset by a valuation allowance. If we have previously had, or have in the future, one or more Section 382 ownership changes, including in connection with our initial public offering or another offering, or if we do not generate sufficient taxable income, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of our NOLs, even if we achieve profitability. If we are limited in our ability to use our NOLs in future years in which we have taxable income, we will pay more taxes than if we were able to fully utilize our NOLs. This could materially and adversely affect our reported financial condition and results of operations. 
 If we are unable to effectively process local number and toll-free number portability provisioning in a timely manner, our growth may be negatively affected. 
 We support local number and toll-free number portability, which allows our customers to transfer to us and thereby retain their existing phone numbers when subscribing to our services. Transferring numbers is a manual process that can take up to 15 business days or longer to complete. A new customer of our subscriptions must maintain both our subscription and the 
 61 

Table of Contents 

 customer s existing phone service during the number transferring process. Any delay that we experience in transferring these numbers typically results from the fact that we depend on third-party global service providers to transfer these numbers, a process that we do not control, and these third-party global service providers may refuse or substantially delay the transfer of these numbers to us. Local number portability is considered an important feature by many potential customers, and if we fail to reduce any related delays, we may experience increased difficulty in acquiring new customers. Moreover, the FCC requires Internet voice communications providers to comply with specified number porting timeframes when customers leave our subscription for the services of another provider. Several international jurisdictions have imposed similar number portability requirements on subscription providers like us. If we or our third-party global service providers are unable to process number portability requests within the requisite timeframes, we could be subject to fines and penalties. Additionally, in the U.S., both customers and global service providers may seek relief from the relevant state public utility commission, the FCC, or in state or federal court for violation of local number portability requirements. 
 Our business could suffer if we cannot obtain or retain direct inward dialing numbers or are prohibited from obtaining local or toll-free numbers or if we are limited to distributing local or toll-free numbers to only certain customers. 
 Our future success depends on our ability to procure large quantities of local and toll-free direct inward dialing numbers DIDs in the U.S. and foreign countries in desirable locations at a reasonable cost and without restrictions. Our ability to procure and distribute DIDs depends on factors outside of our control, such as applicable regulations, the practices of the communications global service providers that provide DIDs, the cost of these DIDs, and the level of demand for new DIDs. For instance, France implemented new rules requiring service providers to obtain DIDs directly from regulatory authorities. Further, due to their limited availability, there are certain popular area code prefixes that we generally cannot obtain. Our inability to acquire DIDs for our operations would make our subscriptions less attractive to potential customers in the affected local geographic areas. In addition, future growth in our customer base, together with growth in the customer bases of other providers of cloud-based business communications, has increased, which increases our dependence on needing sufficiently large quantities of DIDs. 
 We may not be able to manage our inventory levels effectively, which may lead to inventory obsolescence that would force us to incur inventory write-downs. 
 Our vendor-supplied phones have lead times of up to several months for delivery to our fulfillment agents and are built to forecasts that may be imprecise. It is likely that, from time to time, we will have either excess or insufficient product inventory. In addition, because we rely on third-party vendors for the supply of our vendor-supplied phones, our inventory levels are subject to the conditions regarding the timing of purchase orders and delivery dates that are not within our control. Excess inventory levels would subject us to the risk of inventory obsolescence, while insufficient levels of inventory may negatively affect relations with customers. For instance, our customers rely upon our ability to meet committed delivery dates, and any disruption in the supply of our services could result in loss of customers or harm to our ability to attract new customers. Any reduction or interruption in the ability of our vendors to supply our customers with vendor-supplied phones could cause us to lose revenue, damage our customer relationships and harm our reputation in the marketplace. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 We currently depend on a limited number of phone device suppliers and fulfillment agents to configure and deliver the phones that we sell and any delay or interruption in manufacturing, configuring and delivering by these third parties would result in delayed or reduced shipments to our customers and may harm our business. 
 We rely on a limited number of suppliers to provide phones that we offer for sale to our customers that use our services, and we rely on a limited number of fulfillment agents to configure and deliver the phones that we sell to our customers. Accordingly, we could be adversely affected if such third parties fail to maintain competitive phones or configuration services or fail to continue to make them available on attractive terms, or at all. 
 If our fulfillment agents are unable to deliver phones of acceptable quality, or if there is a reduction or interruption in their ability to deliver the phones in a timely manner including due to the end of life of any particular unit, our ability to bring services to market, the reliability of our services and our relationships with customers or our overall reputation in the marketplace could suffer, which could cause us to lose revenue. We expect that it could take several months to effectively transition to new third-party manufacturers or fulfillment agents.

 If our vendor-supplied phones are not able to interoperate effectively with our own back-end servers and systems, our customers may not be able to use our subscriptions, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Hard phones must interoperate with our back-end servers and systems, which contain complex specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards and software applications. Currently, the phones used by our customers are manufactured by a limited number of third-party providers. If any of these providers changes the operation of their phones or implements new or updated firmware releases for their phones, we will be required to undertake development and testing efforts to ensure that the new phones interoperate with our system. In addition, we must be successful in integrating our solutions with strategic partners devices in order to market and sell these solutions. These efforts may require significant capital and employee resources, and we may not accomplish these development efforts quickly or cost-effectively, if at all. If our vendor-supplied phones do not interoperate effectively with our system, our customers ability to use our subscriptions could be delayed or orders for our subscriptions could be canceled, which would harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Any future global health crisis or pandemics could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic impacted worldwide economic activity and financial markets, and forced us to take measures such as temporarily closing our offices and restricting travel. Any resurgence of COVID-19 or any other future pandemic could again result in temporarily suspending travel and restricting the ability to do business in person, which could negatively affect our customer success efforts, sales, and marketing efforts, challenge our ability to enter into customer and other commercial contracts in a timely manner and our ability to source, assess, negotiate, and successfully implement and execute on, and realize the benefits of, acquisitions, investments, strategic partnerships and other strategic transactions, slow down our recruiting efforts, or create operational or other challenges, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, COVID-19 or any future pandemic could disrupt the operations of our customers, channel partners, strategic partners, global service providers, suppliers and other third-party providers, and could generally adversely affect economies and financial markets globally in the future, both of which could decrease technology spending and adversely affect demand for our solutions and harm our business.

 Risks Related to Regulatory Matters 
 Our subscriptions are subject to regulation, and future legislative or regulatory actions could adversely affect our business and expose us to liability in the U.S. and internationally. 
 Federal Regulation 
 Our business is regulated by the FCC. As a communications services provider, we are subject to existing or potential FCC regulations relating to privacy, data security, disability access, access to and porting of numbers and enabling abbreviated dialing to designated numbers, maintaining records for disconnected numbers, cooperation with law enforcement, Federal Universal Service Fund USF contributions, Enhanced 911 E-911 and Next Generation 911 NG 911 ), outage reporting, call authentication, call spoofing, call blocking and other requirements and regulations. The FCC is increasing enforcement of call authentication and related Know-Your-Customer obligations and continues to adopt and consider additional rules related to robocalling and robotexting. FCC classification of our Internet voice communications services as telecommunications services could result in additional federal and state regulatory obligations. If we do not comply with FCC rules and regulations, we could be subject to FCC enforcement actions, fines, loss of licenses or authorizations, repayment of funds, and possibly restrictions on our ability to operate or offer certain of our subscriptions. Any enforcement action by the FCC, which may be a public process, would hurt our reputation in the industry, possibly impair our ability to sell our subscriptions to customers and could have a materially adverse impact on our revenues. In addition, the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act TCPA and FCC rules implementing the TCPA prohibit sending unsolicited facsimile advertisements or making illegal robocalls, subject to certain exceptions. The FCC may take enforcement action against persons or entities that send junk faxes, or make illegal robocalls and individuals also may have a private cause of action. Although the FCC s rules prohibiting unsolicited fax advertisements or making illegal robocalls apply to those who send the advertisements or make the calls, fax transmitters or other service providers that have a high degree of involvement in, or actual notice of, unlawful sending of junk faxes or making of illegal robocalls and have failed to take steps to prevent such transmissions may also face liability under the FCC s rules, or in the case of illegal robocalls, Federal Trade Commission FTC rules. We have implemented processes to prevent our systems from being used to make illegal robocalls or send unsolicited faxes on a large scale, and we do not believe that we have notice of the use of our systems to broadcast junk faxes or make illegal robocalls on a large scale. However, because fax transmitters and related service providers do not enjoy an absolute exemption from liability under the TCPA and related FCC rules, we could face FCC or FTC inquiry and enforcement or civil litigation, or private causes of action, if someone uses our system for such purposes. If any of these were to occur, we could be required to incur significant costs and management s attention could be diverted. Further, if we were to be held liable for the use of our service to send unsolicited faxes or make illegal robocalls or to settle any action or proceeding, any judgment, settlement, or penalties could cause a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, the FTC recently adopted new Click-to-Cancel rules that require businesses to simplify the subscription cancellation process for consumers. The new rules could impose unwarranted costs on our business and could decrease customer satisfaction by reducing opportunities for us to engage in tailored retention efforts 
 State Regulation 
 States currently do not regulate our Internet voice communications subscriptions, which are considered to be nomadic because they can be used from any broadband connection. However, a number of states require us to register as a Voice over Internet Protocol VoIP provider, contribute to state USF, contribute to E-911, and pay other surcharges and annual fees that fund various utility commission programs, while others are actively considering extending their public policy programs to include the subscriptions we provide. We pass USF, E-911 fees, and other surcharges through to our customers, which may result in our subscriptions becoming more expensive or require that we absorb these costs. State public utility commissions may attempt to apply state telecommunications regulations to Internet voice communications subscriptions like ours. 
 Both we and RCLEC are also subject to state consumer protection laws, including privacy and data security requirements, as well as U.S. state or municipal sales, use, excise, gross receipts, utility user and ad valorem taxes, fees, or surcharges. Various federal and state wiretapping laws, including California's CIPA, require at least one party to consent to the capture of the contents of communications. Some states, including California, require the consent of all parties to a conversation. California s CIPA has been a subject of increasing litigation, particularly in the form of class actions. We provide tools that enable customers choice in how they comply with their legal obligations when using our services, and may rely on customers to provide appropriate notifications and obtain necessary consents to ensure compliance under applicable wiretapping laws. Should customers using our services engage in unauthorized recording of calls, we may face third-party claims or class actions, arguing that we contributed to, benefited from, or facilitated our customers' alleged violations. We recently successfully defended litigation involving the CIPA matter as discussed under Note 10 - Commitments and 
 64 

Table of Contents 

 Contingencies in the accompanying notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Successful claims under CIPA allow for the recovery of statutory damages on a per-violation basis, which could result in massive statutory damages. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, or financial condition. 
 International Regulation 
 As we expand internationally, we may be subject to telecommunications, consumer protection, data protection, emergency call services, and other laws, regulations, taxes, and fees in the foreign countries where we offer our subscriptions. Any foreign regulations could impose substantial compliance costs on us, restrict our ability to compete, and impact our ability to expand our service offerings in certain markets. Moreover, the regulatory environment is constantly evolving and changes to the applicable regulations could impose additional compliance costs and require modifications to our technology and operations and go to market practices. European Union member states are currently implementing the new European Electronic Communications Code, including major modifications to the telecommunication laws and regulations in Germany, United Kingdom, and France. Updated regulations in Europe and in the United Kingdom require providers to perform assessments and to improve on the security and resilience of their networks (i.e., the UK Telecommunication Security Act and the EU NIS-2 Directive) as well as to verify the accuracy of their metering and billing systems (UK Total Metering and Billing System audit and Germany art. 63 TKG Metering Audit). Regulators in many of our markets, including the United Kingdom, require providers to implement Know-Your-Customer vetting which may complicate and elongate the sales process. Local telecom regulatory restrictions in France limit our ability to sell numbers and other services in a wholesale motion to channel partners; other European countries have passed or are considering similar regulations. The recent EU Digital Service Act requires cloud and digital providers to adopt measures to prevent disinformation, increase transparency and improve protection for users of digital services in the EU. Internationally, we currently sell our subscriptions in Canada, the U.K., Australia, Singapore, Taiwan, India, and several European countries. We also offer our Global RingEX solution, enabling our multinational customers in locations where we sell our solutions, to establish local phone solutions in various countries internationally. We may be subject to telecommunications, consumer protection, data protection, emergency call services, call authentication, and other laws and regulations in additional countries as we continue to expand our Global RingEX solution internationally. Further, for resellers in certain markets, we may be unable to effectively oversee and quality check certain reseller compliance processes, including those relating to customer verification and fraud mitigation. Any resultant improper or non-compliant use of our service offerings by customers of resellers could result in regulatory or contractual fines, penalties or damages, and could also adversely impact our ability to continue to provide services in impacted markets. 
 In addition, our international operations are potentially subject to country-specific governmental regulation and related actions that may increase our costs or impact our solution and service offerings or prevent us from offering or providing our solutions and subscriptions in certain countries. Certain of our subscriptions may be used by customers located in countries where VoIP and other forms of IP communications may be illegal or require special licensing or in countries on a U.S. embargo list. Even where our solutions are reportedly illegal or become illegal or where users are located in an embargoed country, users in those countries may be able to continue to use our solutions and subscriptions in those countries notwithstanding the illegality or embargo. We may be subject to penalties or governmental action if customers continue to use our solutions and subscriptions in countries where it is illegal to do so, and any such penalties or governmental action may be costly and may harm our business and damage our brand and reputation. We may be required to incur additional expenses to meet applicable international regulatory requirements or be required to discontinue those subscriptions if required by law or if we cannot or will not meet those requirements. 
 The increasing growth and popularity of Internet voice communications, video conferencing and messaging heighten the risk that governments will regulate or impose new or increased fees or taxes on these services. To the extent that the use of our subscriptions continues to grow, and our user base continues to expand, regulators may be more likely to seek to regulate or impose new or additional taxes, surcharges or fees on our subscriptions. 
 We process, store, and use personal information and other data, which subjects us and our customers to a variety of evolving international statutes, governmental regulation, industry standards and self-regulatory schemes, contractual obligations, and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection, which may increase our costs, decrease adoption and use of our solutions and subscriptions, and expose us to liability. 
 In the course of providing our services, we collect, store, and process many types of data, including personal data. Moreover, our customers can use our subscriptions to store contact and other personal or identifying information, and to process, transmit, receive, store, and retrieve a variety of communications and messages, including information about their own customers and other contacts. Customers are able, and may be authorized under certain circumstances, to use our subscriptions

 to transmit, receive, and/or store personal information, which may include, among others, personally identifiable health, financial, and other sensitive information. 
 RingCentral s collection, storage, retention, use, processing, transmission, sharing, disclosure, and safeguarding of personal data (collectively, processing is subject to a myriad of obligations and restrictions flowing from law, regulation, industry standards, and contract. In addition to U.S. federal, state, and local law and regulation, RingCentral is subject to numerous foreign laws and regulations governing these matters where we do business throughout the world. The scope and status of these obligations and restrictions is uncertain, changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions or conflict with other rules. Failure to comply with obligations and restrictions related to data privacy, data protection, and security in any jurisdiction in which we operate could subject us to lawsuits, fines, criminal penalties, statutory damages, consent decrees, injunctions, adverse publicity, and other losses that could harm our business. 
 For example, the GDPR, which came into force in May 2018, strengthened existing data protection regulations in the EU. Its provisions include increasing the maximum level of fines that EU regulators may impose for the most serious of breaches to the greater of 20 million or 4 of worldwide annual turnover. National data protection supervisory authorities have been actively monitoring and sanctioning noncompliance with applicable regulations with particular focus on use of cookies without consent, behavioral profiling, protection of data relating to children, and breach of security. The authority to impose such fines is in addition to (i) the rights of individuals to sue for damages in respect of any data privacy breach that causes them to suffer harm and (ii) the right of individual member states to impose additional sanctions over and above the administrative fines specified in the GDPR. Other European countries have adopted omnibus privacy laws that are based on or similar to the GDPR or are updating their existing privacy laws to reflect GDPR standards, including Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and members of the European Economic Area (the EEA ). 
 Among other requirements, these laws regulate data transferred to countries that have not been found to provide adequate protection to such personal data. On July 10, 2023, the EU Commission adopted the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework DPF to facilitate data flows between the U.S. and the EU. The U.S. and Switzerland have also agreed on a similar DPF. We have self-certified compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF for non-HR data. The U.K. also approved an addendum to the EU DPF to support personal data transfers from the U.K. to the U.S. in September of 2023, and we have self-certified compliance with that framework. The impact of the DPF on data transfers from Europe remains to be seen, and as such uncertainty regarding some details for cross-border data transfers remains. Legal challenges to the adequacy of the DPF have commenced, and there is uncertainty with respect to the speed and the outcome of the legal challenges. 
 In addition to the DPF, we continue to rely on the EU Commission s Standard Contractual Clauses SCCs ), updated in 2021, for the transfer of personal data from the EU to countries not deemed by the EU Commission as providing adequate protection of personal data (e.g., the U.S.). We adopted the 2021 SCCs with our customers and our suppliers transferring data out of the EEA and Switzerland (with approved modifications by the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner). On March 21, 2022, the U.K. Parliament approved the use of an International Data Transfer Agreement or a U.K.-specific addendum to the EU SCCs (collectively, the U.K. SCCs to support personal data transfers out of the U.K., which we adopted as a supplemental means to support data transfers from customers and suppliers in the U.K. to other jurisdictions, including the U.S. and the EU. Despite this, it may be difficult to maintain appropriate safeguards for the transfer of such data from the EEA, Switzerland, and U.K. (collectively, Europe ), as a result of continued legal and legislative activity that has challenged or called into question existing means of data transfers to countries that have not been found to provide adequate protection for personal data. 
 Following the U.K. s exit from the EU, the U.K. largely adopted the EU rules on cross-border data flows, but allowed flexibility to diverge. On June 28, 2021, the European Commission issued an adequacy decision under the GDPR and the Law Enforcement Directive, pursuant to which personal data generally may be transferred from the EU to the U.K. without restriction; however, this adequacy decision is subject to a four-year sunset period, after which the European Commission s adequacy decision may be renewed. If the adequacy decision is not renewed, RingCentral s (and other U.S. companies ability to transfer personal data from the EU to the U.K. for operational purposes could potentially be affected. RingCentral s implementation of the U.K. SCCs may mitigate but does not eliminate the risk associated with non-renewal of the European Commission s adequacy decision. 
 The current SCCs (EU, Swiss, and U.K.) include requirements to conduct personal data transfer impact assessments before transferring personal data out of the EEA, Switzerland, and the U.K. The assessment requires the parties to consider the specific circumstances of the transfer, the laws, and practices of the destination country, particularly relating to government access, and any additional relevant contractual, technical, or organizational safeguards. Each party is required to perform such an assessment and determine whether the transfer can proceed or must be suspended if there are insufficient safeguards to protect the transfer of personal data.

 We may, in addition to other impacts, experience additional costs associated with increased compliance burdens following the implementation of the 2021 SCCs and U.K. SCCs, including requirements to conduct the personal data transfer impact assessments described above, block, or require ad hoc verification of measures taken with respect to certain data flows from the EEA, Switzerland and the U.K. to the U.S and other non-EEA countries. Additionally, we and our customers face the potential for regulators in the EEA, Switzerland, or the U.K. to apply different standards to the transfer of personal data from the EEA, Switzerland, or the U.K. to the U.S. and other countries. Moreover, as regulatory requirements continue to change, RingCentral (and other U.S. companies) may be required to negotiate new contractual data protection obligations with new and existing vendors or third parties that aid in processing personal data on our behalf. 
 Outside of Europe, many other countries, including most countries where RingCentral either provides services or has employees, or both, have adopted or are considering adoption of data protection legislation based on the GDPR or its predecessor, the EU Data Protection Directive, including India, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, and South Korea. Several of these countries, including Australia and Canada, are actively considering legislative proposals to enhance existing privacy regulation. Quebec s Privacy Act, much of which came into effect in September 2023, imposes stringent new requirements for securing consent for personal data processing including via cookies, internal data governance, data transfers, use of personal data for marketing, and disclosure of automated processing. As implementation and enforcement of these existing and new laws and regulations progress, we could experience additional costs associated with increased compliance burdens and contractual obligations, be required to localize certain personal data, and/or be at risk for increased regulatory fines or damages. 
 In the U.S., there are numerous federal and state laws governing the privacy and security of personal information. In particular, at the federal level, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 HIPAA establishes privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information and requires the implementation of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect the privacy of protected health information and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information by certain institutions. We act as a Business Associate through our relationships with certain customers that are HIPAA Covered Entities and are thus directly subject to certain provisions of HIPAA. In addition, if we are unable to protect the privacy and security of protected health information, we could be found to have breached our contracts with customers with whom we have a Business Associate relationship and may also face regulatory liability. Recently, a number of states, including Washington, Connecticut, and Nevada, have adopted laws regulating the processing of consumer health data not regulated by HIPAA. We expect that these laws will cause us to incur additional costs related to compliance, in particular in handling consumer requests for access, deletion, and to exercise other rights. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act GLBA imposes obligations with respect to personal data that we process on behalf of financial institutions. The FTC, which enforces the GLBA in the context of non-bank financial institutions, adopted new breach notification rules in October 2023. Additionally, we are subject to FCC regulations imposing obligations related to our use and disclosure of certain data related to our interconnected VoIP service. The FCC recently announced the creation of a Privacy and Data Protection Task Force that will coordinate agency efforts on the rulemaking, enforcement, and public awareness needs in the privacy and data protection sectors. According to the FCC s Chair, the Task Force, which is headed by the chief of the agency s enforcement bureau, will oversee rulemaking, investigations, and enforcement around data breaches, cyber intrusions, and supply chain vulnerabilities involving third-party vendors that service regulated communications providers. If we experience a suspected data security incident, we may incur significant costs associated with investigation, mitigation, and remediation. In addition, in the event of a data security incident, we may be required by federal or state law or regulations to notify our customers, law enforcement, and/or relevant regulatory authorities. We may also be subject to enforcement actions if the FTC or state attorneys general have reason to believe we have engaged in unfair or deceptive privacy or data security practices. The FTC has also published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking public comment on the need for new regulation of commercial surveillance. 
 While Congress is actively considering comprehensive federal privacy legislation, U.S. states have taken the lead. California, for example, has enacted and subsequently amended (pursuant to a ballot initiative known as the California Privacy Rights Act) the California Consumer Privacy Act CCPA ). Pursuant to the CCPA, we are required, among other things, to make certain enhanced disclosures to California residents regarding our use or disclosure of their personal information, allow California residents to opt-out of certain uses and disclosures of their personal information without penalty, provide Californians with other choices related to personal data in our possession, and obtain opt-in consent before engaging in certain uses of personal information relating to Californians under the age of 16. The California Attorney General may seek substantial monetary penalties and injunctive relief in the event of our non-compliance with the CCPA. The CCPA also allows for private lawsuits from Californians in the event of certain data breaches, and we recently sucessfully defended litigation involving the CIPA matter as discussed under Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Many other states have enacted or are considering laws similar to CCPA, and additional state legislatures are actively considering doing so. When in effect, these laws give consumers additional rights to control the collection, use, and sharing of personal data, including the 
 67 

Table of Contents 

 right to opt-out of the sale or sharing of their data for marketing and, in many cases require opt-in consent to process sensitive personal data. The right to opt-out of personal data processing may impact our marketing activities, particularly those that involve the use of third-party cookies on our websites. This may require that we undertake rigorous due diligence and implement specific contractual terms when we engage marketing entities to market our product and services and may limit our efforts to reach our target audience, as well as require us to implement opt-out icons on our websites. All of these new and evolving state laws, have created further uncertainty and may require us to enter into additional contractual terms with customers and vendors, modify our policies and practices, and otherwise incur additional costs and expenses, in our efforts to comply. 
 Noncompliance with laws and regulations relating to privacy and security of personal information, including HIPAA (including contractual obligations under any Business Associate agreement), GLBA, and state privacy laws may lead to significant fines, civil and criminal penalties, or liabilities. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services HHS audits the compliance of Business Associates and enforces HIPAA privacy and security standards. HHS enforcement activity has become more significant over the last few years and HHS has signaled its intent to continue this trend. Violation of the FCC s privacy rules can result in large monetary forfeitures and injunctive relief. The FTC has broad authority to seek monetary redress for affected consumers and injunctive relief. In addition to federal regulators, state attorneys general (and, in some states, individual residents or state agencies) are authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages (generally ranging from 2,500 to 7,500 per violation, but up to 20,000 in Colorado) to the extent violations implicate the privacy of state residents. Class action lawsuits are common in the event of a data breach affecting financial or other forms of sensitive information. 
 Legislators and regulators in the United States and elsewhere are increasingly focused on privacy protections for minors under 18 years of age. While RingCentral does not knowingly provide products or services directly to children under the age of 16, or knowingly collect or solicit personal information from or about children under the age of 16 outside of the school offering, recent state legislation will, when in effect, impose new obligations on online services where it is reasonable to expect that the service, product, or feature would be accessed by older teens, including, in some cases, 16- and 17-year old children. On September 15, 2022, California passed the California Age-Appropriate Design Code Act, which most recently was held unconstitutional in part by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in a ruling issued in August 2024, and which remains subject to further proceedings in that case, but which otherwise went into effect in July 2024. Similar legislation has been adopted or introduced in numerous other states. Congress is also actively considering legislation regulating the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information about minors. For example, the U.S. Senate passed the bipartisan Kids Online Safety and Privacy Act KOSPA ), which includes the Kids Online Safety Act KOSA and amendments to the Children s Online Privacy Protection Act COPPA 2.0 ). If passed by the U.S. House of Representatives and signed by the President, KOSPA would impose new obligations with respect to data collected from minors under 17 years of age. On July 22, 2024, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce issued a report containing industry guidance to support youth safety online, including recommendations for age-appropriate design and strict limitations on the collection of personal information from or about minors. Outside of the United States, the U.K. s Information Commissioner s Office has published the Age Appropriate Design Code, which it uses to evaluate compliance with the U.K. GDPR. The U.K. s Online Safety Bill, which received royal assent in October 2023, will regulate the design and operation of online platforms that provide user to user interactivity. Many of these new and evolving laws and regulations have required and will continue to require us to incur costs and expenses and will require us to incur additional costs and expenses, in our efforts to comply. 
 Increasingly, jurisdictions in which RingCentral does business are regulating digital services in ways that go beyond traditional privacy and data protection legislation. For example, on November 17, 2022, the Digital Services Act DSA entered into force in the EU. The DSA includes new obligations to limit the spread of illegal content and illegal products online, increase the protection of minors, and provide users with more choice and transparency. The DSA allows for fines of up to 6 of annual turnover. The impact of the DSA on the overall industry, business models and our operations are uncertain, and these regulations could result in changes to our subscriptions or introduce new operational requirements and administrative costs each of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 The European Commission has proposed new legislation to enhance privacy protections for users of communications services and to enhance protection for individuals against online tracking technologies. The proposed legislation, the Regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications (the e-Privacy Regulation ), remains the subject of trilogue negotiations involving representatives of the European Commission, the European Council, and the European Parliament. The e-Privacy Regulation as proposed would impose greater potential liabilities upon communications service providers, including potential fines for the most serious of breaches of the greater of 20 million or 4 of worldwide annual turnover. New rules introduced by the e-Privacy Regulation are likely to include enhanced consent requirements for communications service providers in order to use 
 68 

Table of Contents 

 communications content and communications metadata to deliver value added services, as well as restrict the use of data related to corporations and other non-natural persons. These restrictions, if adopted, may affect our future business growth in the EEA. 
 The EU AI Act, which has been approved by the Council of the European Union, will impose obligations on providers and users of artificial intelligence. Under the EU AI Act, fines can reach up to 30 million or 6 of global income. The EU AI Act may impact the development and adoption of our AI solutions in Europe. Other countries, including the U.S., are increasingly looking to regulate AI. For example, on October 30, 2023, the Biden Administration issued an Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence, and several AI bills have been introduced in Congress. Numerous states have established study commissions that could lead to regulation of AI at the state level, and the Federal Trade Commission, on November 21, 2023, adopted streamlined procedures for AI-related investigations. Other countries, including Brazil, China, and Israel, are contemplating laws regulating AI. As Internet commerce and communication technologies continue to evolve, thereby increasing online service providers and network users capacity to collect, store, retain, protect, use, process, and transmit large volumes of personal information, increasingly restrictive regulation by federal, state, or foreign agencies becomes more likely. 
 RingCentral seeks to comply with applicable data protection laws, regulations, standards, and codes of conduct, as well as our own posted privacy policies and contractual commitments. In addition to the fines and damages described above, any actual or alleged failure by us to comply with any of the foregoing or to protect our users privacy and data, including as a result of our systems being compromised by hacking or other malicious or surreptitious activity, could result in a loss of user confidence in our subscriptions and ultimately in a loss of users, which could materially and adversely affect our business. 
 Regulation of personal information is evolving, and new laws could further impact how we handle personal information or could require us to incur additional compliance costs, either of which could have an adverse impact on our operations. Further, our actual compliance, our customers perception of our compliance, costs of compliance with such regulations, and obligations and customer concerns regarding their own compliance obligations (whether factual or in error) may limit the use and adoption of our subscriptions and reduce overall demand. Even the perception of privacy-related concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our subscriptions in certain industries. 
 Additionally, due to the nature of our service, we are unable to maintain complete control over data security or the implementation of measures that reduce the risk of a data security incident. For example, our customers may accidentally disclose their passwords or store them on a mobile device that is lost or stolen, creating the perception that our systems are not secure against third-party access. Additionally, our third-party contractors in the Philippines, U.S., Georgia, and elsewhere may have access to customer data. If these or other third-party vendors violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations may also put our customers information at risk and could in turn have a material and adverse effect on our business. 
 Our emergency and E-911 calling services may expose us to significant liability. 
 The FCC requires Internet voice communications providers, such as our company, to provide E-911 service in all geographic areas covered by the traditional wireline E-911 network. Under the FCC s rules, Internet voice communications providers must transmit the caller s phone number and registered location information to the appropriate public safety answering point PSAP or route the call to a national emergency call center. The FCC recently adopted rules to promote NG 911, which place additional obligations on RingCentral and its connectivity suppliers. We are also subject to similar requirements internationally. 
 In connection with the regulatory requirements that we provide access to emergency services dialing to our interconnected VoIP customers, we must obtain from each customer, prior to the initiation of or changes to service, the physical locations at which the service will first be used for each VoIP line. For subscriptions that can be utilized from more than one physical location, we must provide customers one or more methods of updating their physical location. Because we are not able to confirm that the service is used at the actual physical addresses provided by our customers, and because customers may provide an incorrect location or fail to provide updated location information, it is possible that emergency services calls may get routed to the wrong PSAP. If emergency services calls are not routed to the correct PSAP, and if the delay results in serious injury or death, we could be sued and the damages substantial. 
 In addition, customers may attempt to hold us responsible for any loss, damage, personal injury, or death suffered as a result of delayed, misrouted, or uncompleted emergency service calls or text messages, subject to any limitations on a provider s liability provided by applicable laws, regulations and our customer agreements.

 Risks Related to Intellectual Property 
 Accusations of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights could materially and adversely affect our business. 
 There has been substantial litigation in the areas in which we operate regarding intellectual property rights. For instance, we have recently and in the past been sued by third parties claiming infringement of their intellectual property rights and we may be sued for infringement from time to time in the future. Also, in some instances, we have agreed to indemnify our customers, resellers, and global service providers for expenses and liability resulting from claimed intellectual property infringement by our solutions. We offer indemnifications in our standard sales contracts, which include the obligation for us to assume the defense and/or reimburse our customers and/or resellers and global service providers for their expenses, settlement and/or liability incurred in connection with allegations of intellectual property infringement. In the past, we have settled infringement litigation brought against us; however, we cannot assure you that we will be able to settle any future claims or, if we are able to settle any such claims, that the settlement will be on terms favorable to us. Our broad range of technology may increase the likelihood that third parties will claim that we, or our customers and/or resellers, and global service providers, infringe their intellectual property rights. 
 We have in the past received, and may in the future receive, notices of claims of infringement, misappropriation or misuse of other parties proprietary rights. Furthermore, regardless of their merits, accusations and lawsuits like these, whether against us or our customers, resellers, and global service providers, may require significant time and expense to defend, may negatively affect customer relationships, may divert management s attention away from other aspects of our operations and, upon resolution, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. 
 Certain technology necessary for us to provide our subscriptions may, in fact, be patented or copyrighted by other parties either now or in the future. If such technology were validly patented or copyrighted by another person, we would have to negotiate a license for the use of that technology. We may not be able to negotiate such a license at a price that is acceptable to us or at all. The existence of such a patent or software, or our inability to negotiate a license for any such technology on acceptable terms, could force us to cease using the technology and cease offering subscriptions incorporating the technology, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 If we, or any of our solutions, were found to be infringing on the intellectual property rights of any third party, we could be subject to liability for such infringement, which could be material. We could also be prohibited from using or selling certain subscriptions, prohibited from using certain processes, required to pay license fees for the technology, or required to redesign certain subscriptions, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 These and other outcomes may: 
 result in the loss of a substantial number of existing customers or prohibit the acquisition of new customers; 
 cause us to pay license fees for intellectual property we are deemed to have infringed; 
 cause us to incur costs and devote valuable technical resources to redesigning our subscriptions; 
 cause our cost of revenues to increase; 
 cause us to manage or defend legal disputes, including litigation which may result in incremental cost, liabilities, reputational damage and distraction to our management team; 
 cause us to accelerate expenditures to preserve existing revenues; 
 cause existing or new vendors to require pre-payments or letters of credit; 
 materially and adversely affect our brand in the marketplace and cause a substantial loss of goodwill; 
 cause us to change our business methods or subscriptions; 
 require us to cease certain business operations or offering certain subscriptions or features; and 
 lead to our bankruptcy or liquidation. 
 Our limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights could materially and adversely affect our business. 
 We rely, in part, on patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret law to protect our intellectual property in the U.S. and abroad. We seek to protect our technology, software, documentation and other information under trade secret and copyright 
 70 

Table of Contents 

 law, which afford only limited protection. For example, we typically enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, third-party contractors, customers, and vendors in an effort to control access to, use of, and distribution of our technology, software, documentation, and other information. These agreements may not effectively prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of such unauthorized use or disclosure, and it may be possible for a third party to legally reverse engineer, copy, or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization. In addition, improper disclosure of trade secret information by our current or former employees, consultants, third-party contractors, customers, or vendors to the public or others who could make use of the trade secret information would likely preclude that information from being protected as a trade secret. 
 We also rely, in part, on patent law to protect our intellectual property in the U.S. and internationally. As of September 30, 2024, our intellectual property portfolio included over 475 issued patents, including patents acquired from strategic partnership transactions, which expire between 2024 and 2042. As of September 30, 2024, we also had 73 patent applications pending examination in the U.S. and 21 patent applications pending examination in foreign jurisdictions, all of which are related to U.S. applications. We cannot predict whether such pending patent applications will result in issued patents or whether any issued patents will effectively protect our intellectual property. Even if a pending patent application results in an issued patent, the patent may be circumvented or its validity may be challenged in various proceedings in United States District Court or before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, such as Post Grant Review or Inter Partes Review, which may require legal representation and involve substantial costs and diversion of management time and resources. We cannot assure completeness of the chain of title of acquired patents prior to the completion of the assignments. In addition, we cannot assure you that every significant feature or functionality of our solutions is protected by our patents, or that we will mark our solutions with any or all patents they embody. As a result, we may be prevented from seeking injunctive relief or damages, in whole or in part for infringement of our patents. 
 Further, we have in the past and may in the future prune our patent portfolio by not continuing to renew some of our patents in some jurisdictions or may decide to divest some of our patents. 
 The unlicensed use of our brand, including domain names, by third parties could harm our reputation, cause confusion among our customers and impair our ability to market our solutions and subscriptions. To that end, we have registered numerous trademarks and service marks and have applied for registration of additional trademarks and service marks and have acquired a large number of domain names in and outside the U.S. to establish and protect our brand names as part of our intellectual property strategy. If our applications receive objections or are successfully opposed by third parties, it will be difficult for us to prevent third parties from using our brand without our permission. Moreover, successful opposition to our applications might encourage third parties to make additional oppositions or commence trademark infringement proceedings against us, which could be costly and time consuming to defend against. If we are not successful in protecting our trademarks, our trademark rights may be diluted and subject to challenge or invalidation, which could materially and adversely affect our brand. 
 Despite our efforts to implement our intellectual property strategy, we may not be able to protect or enforce our proprietary rights in the U.S. or internationally (where effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited). For example, we have entered into agreements containing confidentiality and invention assignment provisions in connection with the outsourcing of certain software development and quality assurance activities to third-party contractors located in Georgia, and previously third-party contractors that we used in other international locations. We have also entered into an agreement containing a confidentiality provision with a third-party contractor located in the Philippines, where we have outsourced a significant portion of our customer support function. We cannot assure you that agreements with these third-party contractors or their agreements with their employees and contractors will adequately protect our proprietary rights in the applicable jurisdictions and foreign countries, as their respective laws may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. In addition, our competitors may independently develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology, duplicate our technology in a manner that does not infringe our intellectual property rights or design around any of our patents. Furthermore, detecting and policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and resource-intensive. Moreover, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Such litigation, whether successful or not, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management time and resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Our use of open source technology could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our subscriptions. 
 We use open source software in our platform on which our subscriptions operate. There is a risk that the owners of the copyrights in such software may claim that such licenses impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to 
 71 

Table of Contents 

 market or provide our subscriptions. If such owners prevail in such claim, we could be required to make the source code for our proprietary software (which contains our valuable trade secrets) generally available to third parties, including competitors, at no cost, to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our subscriptions, to re-engineer our technology, or to discontinue offering our subscriptions in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or at all, any of which could cause us to discontinue our subscriptions, harm our reputation, result in customer losses or claims, increase our costs or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additionally, if a third-party software provider has incorporated open source software into software that we license from such provider, we could be required to disclose our source code that incorporates or is a modification of such licensed software. While we use tools designed to help us monitor and comply with the licenses of third-party open source software and protect our valuable proprietary source code, we may inadvertently use third-party open source software in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the terms of their licenses, including claims of intellectual property rights infringement or for breach of contract. 
 Risks Related to Our Indebtedness 
 Our Credit Agreement imposes operating and financial restrictions on us. 
 On February 14, 2023, we entered into a Credit Agreement among us, the lenders from time to time party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and as collateral agent, providing for a revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility with an initial aggregate principal amount of up to 200.0 million and a delayed draw term loan facility (the Term Loan with an initial aggregate principal amount of up to 400.0 million. The Credit Agreement was amended on August 15, 2023 to increase the Revolving Credit Facility to 225.0 million and further amended in November 2, 2023 to increase the Term Loan to 475.0 million. On August 2, 2024, we executed a Third Amendment to extend the termination date for the undrawn 75.0 million of Term Loan commitments to May 2, 2025. Additionally, on August 6, 2024, we entered into a Fourth Amendment to add 275.0 million in new commitments to the Term Loan (collectively, as amended, the Credit Agreement ). The obligations under the Credit Agreement and related loan documents are guaranteed by certain of our material domestic subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of our personal property and that of the subsidiary guarantors. As of September 30, 2024, the Credit Agreement provided for a 225.0 million revolving loan facility (the Revolving Credit Facility and a 750.0 million delayed draw term loan facility (the Term Loan ). As of September 30, 2024, we had no amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility, 375.0 million principal outstanding under our Term Loan, and 75.0 million of Term Loan commitments available for draw until May 2, 2025 and 275.0 million of Term Loan Commitments available for draw until May 6, 2025. Any drawdown under the Credit Agreement is subject to compliance with the restrictive covenants contained in our Senior Notes Indenture. 
 Our Credit Agreement contains covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to: 
 incur and guarantee additional debt; 
 incur liens; 
 make acquisitions and other investments; 
 dispose of assets; 
 pay dividends and make other distributions in respect of, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock; 
 prepay, redeem or repurchase certain subordinated debt; 
 enter into transactions with affiliates; 
 with respect to such subsidiaries, enter into agreements restricting their ability to pay dividends or make other distributions; and 
 consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our or such subsidiaries assets. 
 Further, the Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that require compliance with a maximum total net leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio, in each case tested at the end of each fiscal quarter. These covenants may adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, meet or otherwise address our capital needs, pursue business opportunities or react to market conditions, or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans. In addition, our obligations to repay principal and interest on our indebtedness could make us vulnerable to economic or market downturns.

 A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under the Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement; however, if an event of default occurs, the lenders may elect to terminate their commitments and accelerate our obligations under the Credit Agreement. Any such acceleration could result in an event of default under the Notes (as defined below). We might not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. Refer to Note 6 Long-Term Debt in the accompanying notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 Servicing our debt, including the Notes and the Credit Agreement, may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay all of our indebtedness. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 161.3 million principal amount of our 0 convertible senior notes due 2025 (the 2025 Convertible Notes outstanding, 609.1 million principal amount of our 0 convertible senior notes due 2026 (the 2026 Convertible Notes and, together with the 2025 Convertible Notes, the Convertible Notes outstanding and 400.0 million principal amount of our 8.500 senior notes due 2030 (the 2030 Senior Notes and, together with the Convertible Notes, the Notes outstanding. The 2025 Convertible Notes will mature on March 1, 2025, the 2026 Convertible Notes will mature on March 15, 2026, and the 2030 Senior Notes will mature on August 15, 2030. As of September 30, 2024, we had no amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility and 375.0 million principal outstanding under our Term Loan. Subject to certain conditions, we may borrow additional amounts under the Credit Agreement, as amended, including up to 225.0 million under our existing Revolving Credit Facility, up to 75.0 million of additional Term Loans that are available until May 2, 2025, and up to 350.0 million of additional Term Loans. 
 Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes and any amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional debt financing or equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance any future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. Additionally, if expectations around our ability to effectively manage and repay our debt obligations are not met in future periods, our financial performance will be harmed and our stock price could be volatile or decline. The Credit Agreement and the indenture governing the 2030 Senior Notes (the Senior Notes Indenture also contain, and any of our future debt agreements may also contain, restrictive covenants that may prohibit us from adopting some or any of these alternatives. For example, the Credit Agreement contains negative covenants that restrict our and our subsidiaries ability to incur indebtedness, create liens, make investments, dispose of assets and make certain restricted payments. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default under our indebtedness which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of our debt and termination of the commitments under the Credit Agreement. 
 In addition, our indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have other important consequences. For example, it could: 
 require a portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available to fund acquisitions, for working capital and capital expenditures, and for other general corporate purposes; 
 make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general U.S. and worldwide economic, industry, and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulations; 
 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry; 
 place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt; 
 limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund acquisitions, for working capital and capital expenditures, and for other general corporate purposes; 
 make an acquisition of our company less attractive or more difficult; and 
 limit our ability to repurchase capital stock or manage shareholder dilution. 
 Any of these factors could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, if we incur additional indebtedness, the risks related to our business and our ability to service or repay our indebtedness would increase.

 We may require additional capital or need to restructure our existing debt to pursue our business objectives and to respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances. If capital is not available to us, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected. 
 We intend to continue to make expenditures and investments to support the growth of our business and may require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges, or unforeseen circumstances, including the need to develop new solutions or enhance our existing solutions, enhance our operating infrastructure, and acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financing activities to secure additional funds or restructure our existing debt. However, additional funds may not be available or we may not be able to restructure our existing debt when we need to on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Volatility in equity capital markets may materially and adversely affect our ability to fund our business through public or private sales of equity securities or debt restructuring. Rising interest rates and/or instability in the banking and finance industries may reduce our access to debt capital. Our current debt agreements do contain and any future debt financing that we secure in the future may include restrictive covenants, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. In addition, the restrictive covenants in the Credit Agreement, Senior Notes Indenture and any additional credit facilities or debt agreements we may secure in the future may restrict us from being able to conduct our operations in a manner appropriate for our business and may restrict our growth, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 We cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with any such restrictive covenants. In the event that we are unable to comply with these covenants in the future, we would seek an amendment or waiver of the covenants. We cannot assure you that any such waiver or amendment would be granted. In such event, we may be required to repay any or all of our existing borrowings, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to borrow under our existing credit agreements, or obtain alternative funding arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. 
 In addition, volatility in the credit markets may have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain debt financing. The conversion of our outstanding Convertible Notes and any future issuances of other equity or any future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities could result in significant dilution to our existing stockholders, and any new equity or convertible debt securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of holders of our Class A Common Stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to pursue our business objectives and to respond to business opportunities, challenges, or unforeseen circumstances could be significantly limited, and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. 
 We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Convertible Notes in cash or to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change or change of control under the applicable Notes Indenture (as defined below) governing the Notes or pay the principal amount of the Notes at maturity, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the Notes, as applicable. 
 Holders of the Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of such Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or change of control, as applicable, before the applicable maturity date at a repurchase price as set forth in the Senior Notes Indenture or the indentures governing our Convertible Notes (the Convertible Notes Indentures and, together with the Senior Notes Indenture, the Notes Indentures ), as applicable, plus any accrued and unpaid interest or special interest thereon, if any, as set forth in the applicable Notes Indenture. In addition, upon conversion of the Convertible Notes of the applicable series, we will be required to make cash payments in respect of such Convertible Notes being converted, as set forth in the applicable Convertible Notes Indenture. Moreover, we will be required to repay the Notes of the applicable series in cash at their respective maturity unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased, as applicable. However, even though we entered into the Credit Agreement, we cannot assure you that we will have enough available cash on hand or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of such Notes surrendered therefor or pay cash with respect to (i) such series of Convertible Notes being converted or (ii) such series of Notes at their respective maturity. 
 In addition, our ability to repurchase the Notes of the applicable series or to pay cash (i) upon conversions of the Convertible Notes or (ii) at their respective maturity may be limited by law, regulatory authority, or potential agreements governing our future indebtedness. Further, our failure to repurchase such Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the applicable Notes Indenture or to pay cash (i) upon conversions of such Convertible Notes or (ii) at their respective maturity, as required by the applicable Notes Indenture, would constitute a default under such Notes Indenture. A default, or the occurrence of a fundamental change or change of control, as applicable, under such Notes Indenture, could also lead to a default under potential agreements governing our future indebtedness. Moreover, the occurrence of a fundamental change or change of 
 74 

Table of Contents 

 control, as applicable, under the applicable Notes Indenture could itself constitute an event of default under any such Notes Indenture. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase such series of Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof, as applicable. 
 The Senior Notes Indenture contains restrictive, operational, and financial covenants that may limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. 
 The Senior Notes Indenture contains restrictive covenants that may limit our ability, and the ability of our subsidiary guarantors, to, among other things: 
 create liens on certain assets to secure debt; 
 grant a subsidiary guarantee of certain debt without also providing a guarantee of the 2030 Senior Notes; and 
 consolidate or merge with or into, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets to, another person. 
 As a result of these restrictions, we will be limited as to how we conduct our business, and we may be unable to access all of our available commitments under the Credit Agreement, raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration or cross-acceleration of the 2030 Senior Notes. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or cannot refinance these borrowings, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 Our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above and/or the terms of any future indebtedness from time to time could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due dates. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or cannot refinance these borrowings, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 The conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. 
 The Convertible Notes contain a conversion feature that allows holders to convert their Convertible Notes into shares of our Class A Common Stock as set forth in each of the Convertible Notes Indentures. In the event the conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes is triggered, holders of the Convertible Notes will be entitled under the applicable Convertible Notes Indenture to convert such Convertible Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders of a series elect to convert their Convertible Notes, we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation in cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, in certain circumstances, such as conversion by holders or redemption, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of such series of Convertible Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital. 
 The capped call transactions may affect the value of the Convertible Notes and our Class A Common Stock and we are subject to counterparty risk. 
 In connection with the issuances of the 2026 Convertible Notes, we entered into capped call transactions with the counterparties with respect to the 2026 Convertible Notes. The capped call transactions cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock initially underlying the 2026 Convertible Notes. The capped call transactions are expected to offset the potential dilution as a result of conversion of the 2026 Convertible Notes. 
 The counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our Class A Common Stock and/or purchasing or selling our Class A Common Stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions at any time prior to the maturity of the 2026 Convertible Notes (and are likely to do so on each exercise date of the capped call transactions). This activity could also cause or prevent an increase or a decrease in the market price of our Class A Common Stock. 
 75 

Table of Contents 

 We do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the 2026 Convertible Notes or the shares of our Class A Common Stock. In addition, we do not make any representation that these transactions will not be discontinued without notice. 
 In addition, the counterparties to the capped call transactions are financial institutions and we will be subject to the risk that one or more of the counterparties may default or otherwise fail to perform, or may exercise certain rights to terminate, their obligations under the capped call transactions. If a counterparty to one or more capped call transaction becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under such transaction. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, it will increase if the market price or the volatility of our Class A Common Stock increases. Upon a default or other failure to perform, or a termination of obligations, by a counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our Class A Common Stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the counterparties. 
 Risks Related to Our Class A Common Stock and Our Charter Provisions 
 The market price of our Class A Common Stock is likely to be volatile and could decline. 
 The stock market in general, and the market for SaaS and other technology-related stocks in particular, has been highly volatile. As a result, the market price and trading volume for our Class A Common Stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile, and investors in our Class A Common Stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. Factors that could cause the market price of our Class A Common Stock to fluctuate significantly include: 
 our operating and financial performance and prospects and the performance of other similar companies including our strategic partners and global service providers; 
 our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry; 
 conditions that impact demand for our subscriptions; 
 the public s reaction to our press releases, financial guidance, and other public announcements, and filings with the SEC; 
 changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities or research analysts who track our Class A Common Stock; 
 actual or perceived security breaches, or other privacy or cybersecurity incidents; 
 market and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our growth strategy; 
 strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings; 
 changes in government and other regulations; 
 changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations, or principles; 
 arrival and departure of key personnel; 
 sales of common stock by us, our investors, or members of our management team; 
 repurchases of Class A Common Stock by the Company; 
 changes in general market, economic, and political conditions in the U.S. and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from natural disasters, telecommunications failure, cyber-attack, changes in diplomatic or trade relationships, banking crises, civil unrest in various parts of the world, acts of war (including geopolitical tensions related to the war between Russia and Ukraine, resulting sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other countries, and retaliatory actions taken by Russia in response to such sanctions, and the conflicts in the Middle East, terrorist attacks, or other catastrophic events, such as the global outbreak of COVID-19 or any future pandemic; and 
 Geopolitical relations between the U.S. and China. 
 Any of these factors may result in large and sudden changes in the trading volume and market price of our Class A Common Stock and may prevent investors from being able to sell their shares at or above the price they paid for their shares of our Class A Common Stock. Following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities, stockholders often

 file securities class-action lawsuits against such company. Our involvement in a class-action lawsuit could divert our senior management s attention and, if adversely determined, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 For as long as the dual class structure of our common stock as contained in our charter documents is in effect, voting control will be concentrated with a limited number of stockholders that held our stock prior to our initial public offering, including primarily our founders and their affiliates, and limiting other stockholders ability to influence corporate matters. 
 Our Class B common stock, par value 0.0001 per share Class B Common Stock and, together with our Class A Common Stock, our common stock ), has 10 votes per share, and our Class A Common Stock has one vote per share. Additionally, our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock has voting power measured on an as-converted to Class A Common Stock basis. As of September 30, 2024, stockholders who hold shares of Class B Common Stock, including our founders and certain executive officers, and their affiliates, together hold approximately 55 of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock, and our founders, including our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, together hold a majority of such voting power. As a result, for as long as the Class B voting structure remains in place, a small number of stockholders who acquired their shares prior to the completion of our initial public offering will continue to have significant influence over the management and affairs of our company and over the outcome of many matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger, consolidation or sale of substantially all of our assets. 
 In addition, because of the ten-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A Common Stock, the holders of Class B Common Stock collectively will continue to control many matters submitted to our stockholders for approval even if their stock holdings represent less than 50 of the outstanding shares of our capital stock. This concentrated control will limit your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, and, as a result, the market price of our Class A Common Stock could be adversely affected. 
 Future transfers by holders of Class B Common Stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A Common Stock, which may have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B Common Stock who retain their shares in the long term. If, for example, Mr. Shmunis retains a significant portion of his holdings of Class B Common Stock for an extended period of time, he could, in the future, control a majority of the combined voting power of our capital stock. As a board member, Mr. Shmunis owes fiduciary duties to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr. Shmunis is generally entitled to vote his shares in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally. 
 We have never paid cash dividends and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock. 
 We currently do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future and plan to, instead, retain any earnings to finance our operations and growth. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability to pay dividends. Because we have never paid cash dividends and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, the only opportunity to achieve a return on an investor s investment in our company will be if the market price of our Class A Common Stock appreciates and the investor sells its shares at a profit. There is no guarantee that the price of our Class A Common Stock that will prevail in the market will ever exceed the price that an investor pays. 
 The holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to vote on an as-converted to Class A Common Stock basis and have rights to approve certain actions. 
 The holders of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are generally entitled to vote with the holders of our common stock on all matters submitted for a vote of holders of shares of our capital stock (voting together with the holders of shares of common stock as one class) on an as-converted basis. However, the consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (voting together as a separate class) is required in order for us to take certain actions, including (i) any amendment, alteration, or repeal of (A) any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws that adversely affects, in any material respect, the rights, preferences, privileges, or voting power of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock or the holders thereof or (B) any provision of our certificate of designations, (ii) issuances of securities that are senior to, or equal in priority with, the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock as to dividend rights or rights on the distribution of assets on liquidation, (iii) any increase or decrease in the authorized number of shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock or issuances thereof, and (iv) any dividend on our common stock that is a one-time special dividend of 100,000,000 or more.

Table of Contents 

 As a result, the holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock may in the future have the ability to influence the outcome of certain matters affecting our governance and capitalization. 
 The issuance of shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock reduces the relative voting power of holders of our common stock, and the conversion of those shares into shares of our Class A Common Stock would dilute the ownership of our common stockholders and may adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common Stock. 
 The holders of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are generally entitled to vote, on an as-converted basis, together with holders of our common stock, on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of our capital stock, which reduces the relative voting power of the holders of our common stock. In addition, the conversion of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into Class A Common Stock would dilute the ownership interest of existing holders of our common stock, and any conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock would increase the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for public trading, which could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Class A Common Stock. 
 Our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock has rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to the rights of, our common stockholders, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. 
 The holders of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock have the right to receive payments as to dividend rights and on account of the distribution of assets on any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our business before any payment may be made to holders of any other class or series of capital stock. In addition, upon prior written notice of certain change of control events, all shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will automatically be redeemed by us for a repurchase price equal to 1,000 per share of each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the Liquidation Preference ). These dividend and share repurchase obligations could impact our liquidity and reduce the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, growth opportunities, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes. Our obligations to the holders of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. The preferential rights could also result in divergent interests between the holders of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and holders of our common stock. 
 We cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase programs will be fully implemented or that they will enhance long-term stockholder value. 
 Our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program. Under the most recent authorization, we may repurchase up to 250.0 million of our outstanding Class A Common Stock, subject to certain limitations. We plan to fund repurchases under this program from our future cash flow generation, as well as from additional potential sources of cash including capped calls associated with the Convertible Notes. Under this program, share repurchases may be made at our discretion from time to time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, or other means. This program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares of our Class A Common Stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased approximately 242.3 million of our Class A Common Stock under this program. The timing and number of any future shares repurchased under this program will be determined by our management and will depend on a variety of factors, including stock price, trading volume, and general business and market conditions. Our board of directors will review this program periodically and may authorize adjustments of its terms, if appropriate. As a result, there can be no guarantee around the timing or volume of our share repurchases. This program could affect the price of our Class A Common Stock, increase volatility and diminish our cash reserves. This program may be suspended or terminated at any time and, even if fully implemented, may not enhance long-term stockholder value. Refer to Part II, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 Anti-takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and under Delaware corporate law could make an acquisition of us more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our Class A Common Stock. 
 Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that: 
 authorize our board of directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, up to 100,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock, 200,000 share of which are currently designated as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock; 
 78 

Table of Contents 

 require that, once our outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent; specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors, the Chairman of our board of directors, or our Chief Executive Officer; 
 establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors; 
 prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors; 
 provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum; 
 state that the approval of the holders of a supermajority of our outstanding shares of capital stock is required to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation; and 
 reflect two classes of common stock, as discussed above. 
 These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder without obtaining specified approvals. 
 If research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our Class A Common Stock, our stock price and trading volume may decline. 
 The trading market for our Class A Common Stock will depend in part on the research and reports that research analysts publish about us and our business. If we do not maintain adequate research coverage or if one or more analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our Class A Common Stock may decline. If one or more of the research analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our Class A Common Stock may decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. 
 General Risk Factors 
 Changes in effective tax rates, or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including: 
 changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; 
 expiration of, or lapses in, the research and development tax credit laws; 
 expiration or non-utilization of net operating loss carryforwards; 
 tax effects of share-based compensation; 
 expansion into new jurisdictions; 
 potential challenges to and costs related to implementation and ongoing operation of our intercompany arrangements; 
 changes in tax laws and regulations and accounting principles, or interpretations or applications thereof; and 
 certain non-deductible expenses as a result of acquisitions. 
 Any changes in our effective tax rate could adversely affect our results of operations.

 Changes in U.S. and foreign tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial conditions. 
 We are subject to tax laws, regulations, and policies of the U.S. federal, state, and local governments and of comparable taxing authorities in foreign jurisdictions. Changes in tax laws, as well as other factors, could cause us to experience fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rates and otherwise adversely affect our tax positions and/or our tax liabilities. For example, in 2019, France introduced a digital services tax at a rate of 3 on revenues derived from digital activities in France, and other jurisdictions are proposing or could introduce similar laws in the future. In addition, the United States recently introduced a 1 excise tax on stock buybacks, which could increase the cost to us of implementing our share repurchase programs or repurchasing our Series A Preferred Stock, and a 15 alternative minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income. Many countries, including the United States, and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the OECD are also actively considering changes to existing tax laws or have proposed or enacted new laws that could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business or cause us to change the way we operate our business. As an example, On October 8, 2021, the OECD announced the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (the Framework which agreed to a two-pillar solution to address tax challenges arising from digitalization of the economy. On December 20, 2021, the OECD released Pillar Two Model Rules defining the global minimum tax rules, which contemplate a minimum tax rate of 15 for large multinational companies. On December 15, 2022, the European Union (EU) Member States formally adopted the EU s Pillar Two Directive and various countries have enacted or are in the process of enacting legislation on these rules. The Pillar Two legislative changes, when enacted by various countries in which we do business, are not anticipated to have a material impact on our tax liabilities. We will continue to monitor legislative and regulatory developments to assess potential impacts that Pillar Two rules may have on our business, operating results and financial condition. Any further developments or changes in U.S. federal or state, or international tax laws or tax rulings could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our operating results. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rates, tax payments, tax credits, or incentives will not be adversely affected by these or other developments or changes in law. 
 If our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, it may adversely affect investor confidence in our company. 
 Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, is required to and has issued an attestation report as of December 31, 2023. While management concluded internal control over financial reporting was at a reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2023, there can be no assurance that material weaknesses will not be identified in the future. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. As a result, we may need to undertake various actions, such as implementing new internal controls and procedures and hiring accounting or internal audit staff. Our remediation efforts may not enable us to avoid a material weakness in the future. 
 If our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could cause the price of our Class A Common Stock to decline, and we may be subject to investigation or sanctions by the SEC. 
 The nature of our business requires the application of complex revenue and expense recognition rules and the current legislative and regulatory environment affecting generally accepted accounting principles is uncertain. Significant changes in current principles could affect our financial statements going forward and changes in financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse, unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and harm our operating results. 
 The accounting rules and regulations that we must comply with are complex and subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB ), the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. Recent actions and public comments from the FASB and the SEC have focused on the integrity of financial reporting and internal controls. In addition, many companies accounting policies are being subject to heightened scrutiny by regulators and the public. Further, the accounting rules and regulations are continually changing in ways that could materially impact our financial statements. 
 We cannot predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or our accounting policies on our financial statements going forward, which could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of the change. While we are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require a material update to our estimates, judgments or assumptions, this may change in the future. In

 addition, if we were to change our critical accounting estimates, including those related to the recognition of subscription revenue and other revenue sources, our operating results could be significantly affected. 
 Our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies may be based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, such as with respect to our recoverability assessment for prepaid sales commission balances with Avaya, which could cause our results of operations to fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our Class A common stock. 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The significant estimates made by management affect revenues, the allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of long-term investments, deferred and prepaid sales commission costs, goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets, share-based compensation, capitalization of internally developed software, return reserves, provision for income taxes, uncertain tax positions, loss contingencies, sales tax liabilities, and accrued liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as described in the section titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the recognition and measurement of certain assets and liabilities and revenue and expenses that is not readily apparent from other sources. Our accounting policies that involve judgment include those related to revenues the allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of long-term investments, deferred and prepaid sales commission costs, goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets, share-based compensation, capitalization of internally developed software, return reserves, provision for income taxes, uncertain tax positions, loss contingencies, sales tax liabilities, and accrued liabilities. If our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, our results of operations could be adversely affected, which could cause our results of operations to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our Class A common stock. 
 Regulators , investors and other stakeholders expectations of our performance relating to environmental, social and governance factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks. 
 There is an increasing focus from regulators, investors, customers and other stakeholders concerning environmental, social and governance matters ESG ). Regulators are driving legislation to bring consistency and transparency to ESG disclosures. Some investors may use these ESG performance factors to guide their investment strategies and, in some cases, may choose not to invest in us if they believe our policies and actions relating to ESG are inadequate. We may face reputational damage in the event that we do not meet the ESG standards set by various constituencies. 
 Our voluntary ESG and climate disclosures, as well as our reporting under related disclosure regulations, or a failure to meet evolving stakeholder expectations for ESG reporting and practices, may potentially harm our reputation and customer relationships or expose us to liability. Due to new regulatory standards and market standards, certain new or existing customers may impose stricter ESG guidelines or contractual language for, and may scrutinize relationships more closely with, their counterparties, including us, which may lengthen sales cycles or increase our costs. 
 Furthermore, if our competitors ESG performance is perceived to be better than ours, potential or current investors may elect to invest with our competitors instead. In addition, in the event that we communicate certain initiatives or goals regarding ESG matters, we could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of such initiatives or goals, or we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals. 
 Our corporate headquarters, one of our data centers and co-location facilities, our third-party customer service and support facilities, and a research and development facility are located near known earthquake fault zones, and the occurrence of an earthquake, tsunami, or other catastrophic disaster could damage our facilities or the facilities of our contractors, which could cause us to curtail our operations. 
 Our corporate headquarters and other offices and many of our data centers, co-location and research and development facilities, and third-party customer service call centers are located in the U.S. (including in the state of California), Spain, Georgia, Bulgaria, and several countries in Asia, including China, the Philippines, India, and Australia. Many of these locations are near known earthquake fault zones, which are vulnerable to damage from earthquakes and tsunamis, or are in areas subject to hurricanes and typhoons. We and our contractors are also vulnerable to other types of disasters, such as power loss, fire, floods, pandemics such as the global outbreak of COVID-19, cyber-attack, war (including ongoing geopolitical tensions related

 to the war between Russia and Ukraine, resulting sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other countries, and retaliatory actions taken by Russia in response to such sanctions, including the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East), political unrest, and terrorist attacks and similar events that are beyond our control. If any disasters or geopolitical conflicts were to occur or worsen, our ability to operate our business could be seriously impaired, and we may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, loss of intellectual property, delays in our subscriptions development, lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security, and loss of critical data, all of which could harm our future results of operations. In addition, we do not carry earthquake insurance and we may not have adequate insurance to cover our losses resulting from other disasters or other similar significant business interruptions. Any significant losses that are not recoverable under our insurance policies could seriously impair our business and financial condition.

Such Letter of Credit Application must be received by the relevant L C Issuer and the Administrative Agent not later than 1 00 p.m. at least three (3) Business Days prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be or, in each case, such later date and time as the relevant L C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in its sole discretion.

Unless the relevant L C Issuer has received written notice from the Administrative Agent, any Revolving Credit Lender or any Loan Party, at least one (1) Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in Article IV shall not have been satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, such L C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the Borrower (and, if requested, on behalf of a Restricted Subsidiary) or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Revolving Credit Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, acquire from the relevant L C Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Revolving Credit Lender s Revolving Credit Percentage times the amount of such Letter of Credit. 
 (iii) If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, the relevant L C Issuer shall agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic renewal provisions (each, an Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit provided that any such Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit must permit the relevant L C Issuer to prevent any such renewal at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the Nonrenewal Notice Date in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the relevant L C Issuer, the Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to the relevant L C Issuer for any such renewal. Once an Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit has been issued, the applicable Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the relevant L C Issuer to permit the renewal of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date provided that the relevant L C Issuer shall not permit any such renewal if (A) the relevant L C Issuer has determined that it would 

have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its renewed form under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of Section 2.03(a)(ii) or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone, followed promptly in writing, or in writing) on or before the day that is five (5) Business Days before the Nonrenewal Notice Date from the Administrative Agent or any Revolving Credit Lender, as applicable, or the Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied. 
 (iv) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the relevant L C Issuer will also deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment. 
 (c) Drawings and Reimbursements Funding of Participations. 
 (i) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the relevant L C Issuer shall notify promptly the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof. On the Business Day immediately following the Business Day on which the Borrower shall have received notice of any payment by an L C Issuer under a Letter of Credit (or, if the Borrower shall have received such notice later than 1 00 p.m. on any Business Day, on the second succeeding Business Day) (each such date, an Honor Date ), the Borrower shall reimburse such L C Issuer through the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing in Dollars by 1 00 p.m. on such Business Day. If the Borrower fails to so reimburse such L C Issuer by such time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Revolving Credit Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (the Unreimbursed Amoun t ), and the amount of such Revolving Credit Lender s Applicable Percentage thereof under each Class of Revolving Credit Commitments held by such Revolving Credit Lender. In such event, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Credit Borrowing of Base Rate Loans under each Revolving Credit Facility to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the pro rata portion of the Unreimbursed Amount allocable to such Revolving Credit Facility, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Revolving Credit Commitments of the Revolving Credit Lenders under such Revolving Credit Facility, and subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than the delivery of a Committed Loan Notice) provided that any drawing under a Letter of Credit that is not reimbursed on the date of drawing shall accrue interest from the date of drawing at the rate applicable to Initial Revolving Credit Loans that are Base Rate Loans (or, to the extent of the participation in such drawing by any Revolving Credit Lender of another Class, the rate per annum then applicable to the Revolving Credit Loans of such Class) subject to the provisions set forth below. Any notice given by an L C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.03(c)(i) may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice. 
 (ii) Each Revolving Credit Lender (including any such Lender acting as an L C Issuer) shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) make funds available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant L C Issuer, in Dollars, at the Administrative Agent s Office in an amount equal to its Revolving Credit Percentage of any Unreimbursed Amount in respect of a Letter of Credit not later than 1 00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon each Revolving Credit Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower under each Class of Revolving Credit Commitments held by such Revolving Credit Lender in an amount equal to the pro rata portion of such funds allocable to such Class 

of Revolving Credit Commitments. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the relevant L C Issuer. 
 (iii) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount in respect of a Letter of Credit that is not fully refinanced by Revolving Credit Borrowings of Base Rate Loans because the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the relevant L C Issuer an L C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In such event, each Revolving Credit Lender s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant L C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L C Borrowing and shall constitute an L C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.03 . 
 (iv) Until each Revolving Credit Lender funds its Revolving Credit Loans or L C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) to reimburse the relevant L C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender s Applicable Percentage of such amount under each applicable Revolving Credit Facility shall be solely for the account of the relevant L C Issuer. 
 (v) Each Revolving Credit Lender s obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans or L C Advances to reimburse an L C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.03(c) , shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the relevant L C Issuer, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing provided that each Revolving Credit Lender s obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans (but not L C Advances) pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than delivery by the Borrower of a Committed Loan Notice). No such making of an L C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the relevant L C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by such L C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein. 
 (vi) If any Revolving Credit Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant L C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03(c) by the time specified in Section 2.03(c)(ii) , such L C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such L C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the L C Issuer in connection with the foregoing. If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in the relevant Borrowing or L C Advance in respect of the relevant L C Borrowing, as the case may be. A certificate of the relevant L C Issuer submitted to any Revolving Credit Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.03(c)(vi) shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error. 
 (vii) If, at any time after an L C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Revolving Credit Lender such Lender s L C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with this Section 2.03(c) , the Administrative Agent receives for the account of such L C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether 

directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to each Revolving Credit Lender its Revolving Credit Percentage thereof (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender s L C Advance was outstanding) in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent. 
 (viii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of an L C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by such L C Issuer in its discretion), each Revolving Credit Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such L C Issuer its Revolving Credit Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. 
 (d) Obligations Absolute . The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the relevant L C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit issued by it and to repay each L C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following 
 (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto 
 (ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that any Loan Party may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the relevant L C Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction 
 (iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit 
 (iv) any payment by the relevant L C Issuer under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or any payment made by the relevant L C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law 
 (v) any exchange, release or nonperfection of any Collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from the Guaranty or any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations of any Loan Party in respect of such Letter of Credit 
 (vi) reserved or 

(vii) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Loan Party 
 provided that the foregoing shall not excuse any L C Issuer from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable Law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by such L C Issuer s gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final non-appealable judgment) when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. 
 (e) Role of L C Issuers . Each Lender and the Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the relevant L C Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the L C Issuers, any Agent-Related Person nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of any L C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the Required Revolving Credit Lenders, as applicable (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final non-appealable judgment) by such Person or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit Application. The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit provided that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrower s pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the L C Issuers, any Agent-Related Person, nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of any L C Issuer, shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (iii) of this Section 2.03(e) provided that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against an L C Issuer, and such L C Issuer may be liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower caused by such L C Issuer s willful misconduct or gross negligence or such L C Issuer s willful or grossly negligent failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit (in each case, as determined by the final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction). In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each L C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and no L C Issuer shall be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason. 
 (f) Cash Collateral . (i) If any Event of Default occurs and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, the Required Lenders, or the Required Revolving Credit Lenders, as applicable, require the Borrower to Cash Collateralize the L C Obligations pursuant to Section 8.02(c) or (ii) an Event of Default set forth under Section 8.01(f) or (g) occurs and is continuing, then the Borrower shall Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all L C Obligations (in an amount equal to such Outstanding Amount determined as of the date of such Event of Default), and shall do so not later than 2 00 p.m. on (x) in the case of the immediately preceding clause (i) , (1) the Business Day that the 

Borrower receives notice thereof, if such notice is received on such day prior to 1 00 p.m., or (2) if clause (1) above does not apply, the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice and (y) in the case of the immediately preceding clause (ii) , the Business Day on which an Event of Default set forth under Section 8.01(f) or (g) occurs or, if such day is not a Business Day, the Business Day immediately succeeding such day, in either case, by 1 00 p.m. on such day. For purposes hereof, Cash Collateralize means to pledge and deposit with or deliver to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the relevant L C Issuer and the Revolving Credit Lenders, as collateral for the L C Obligations, cash or deposit account balances in an amount equal to the then Outstanding Amount of all applicable L C Obligations (determined as of the date of such Event of Default) Cash Collateral pursuant to documentation in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the relevant L C Issuer (which documents are hereby consented to by the Revolving Credit Lenders). Derivatives of such term have corresponding meanings. The Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, a security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein and all proceeds of the foregoing. Cash Collateral shall be maintained in accounts satisfactory to the Administrative Agent in the name of the Administrative Agent as custodian for the Borrower and for the benefit of the Secured Parties and may be invested in readily available Cash Equivalents at its sole discretion. If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that any funds held as Cash Collateral are subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Secured Parties) or that the total amount of such funds is less than the aggregate Outstanding Amount of all L C Obligations, the Borrower will, forthwith upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay to the Administrative Agent, as additional funds to be deposited and held in the deposit accounts satisfactory to the Administrative Agent as aforesaid, an amount equal to the excess of (x) such aggregate Outstanding Amount over (y) the total amount of funds, if any, then held as Cash Collateral that the Administrative Agent reasonably determines to be free and clear of any such right and claim. Upon the drawing of any Letter of Credit for which funds are on deposit as Cash Collateral, such funds shall be applied, to the extent permitted under applicable Law, to reimburse the relevant L C Issuer. To the extent the amount of any Cash Collateral exceeds the then Outstanding Amount of such L C Obligations plus costs incidental thereto and so long as no other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the excess shall be refunded to the Borrower. If such Event of Default is cured or waived and no other Event of Default is then occurring and continuing, the amount of any Cash Collateral and accrued interest thereon shall be refunded to the Borrower. 
 (g) Letter of Credit Fees . The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Credit Lender of any Class a Letter of Credit fee with respect to its participation in Letters of Credit equal to the product of (i) the Applicable Rate used to determine the interest rate applicable to Revolving Credit Loans of such Class that are Term SOFR Loans and (ii) the amount of such Revolving Credit Lender s L C Obligations attributable to its Revolving Credit Commitment of such Class (other than Unreimbursed Amounts). Such Letter of Credit fees shall be computed on a quarterly basis in arrears. Such Letter of Credit fees shall be due and payable on the first Business Day after the end of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand.

The Borrower shall pay directly to each L C Issuer for its own account a fronting fee (a Fronting Fee with respect to each Letter of Credit issued by it equal to 0.125 per annum of the daily maximum amount then available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. Such fronting fees shall be computed on a 

quarterly basis in arrears. Such fronting fees shall be due and payable on the first Business Day after the end of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand. In addition, the Borrower shall pay directly to each L C Issuer for its own account the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of such L C Issuer relating to letters of credit as from time to time in effect. Such customary fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable within ten (10) Business Days of demand and are nonrefundable. 
 (i) Conflict with Letter of Credit Application . Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in any Letter of Credit Application, in the event of any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Letter of Credit Application, the terms hereof shall control. 
 (j) Addition of an L C Issuer . A Revolving Credit Lender (or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates) may become an additional L C Issuer hereunder pursuant to a written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and such Revolving Credit Lender, which such written agreement shall also provide that the commitment of such additional L C Issuer to issue Letters of Credit shall not exceed at any time the amount set forth in such written agreement. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Revolving Credit Lenders of any such additional L C Issuer. 
 (k) Provisions Related to Extended Revolving Credit Commitments . If the Maturity Date in respect of any Class of Revolving Credit Commitments occurs prior to the expiration of any Letter of Credit, then (i) if one or more other Classes of Revolving Credit Commitments in respect of which the Maturity Date shall not have occurred are then in effect, such Letters of Credit shall automatically be deemed to have been issued (including for purposes of the obligations of the Revolving Credit Lenders to purchase participations therein and to make Revolving Credit Loans and payments in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.03(c) under (and ratably participated in by Lenders pursuant to) the Revolving Credit Commitments in respect of such non-terminating Classes up to an aggregate amount not to exceed the aggregate principal amount of the unutilized Revolving Credit Commitments thereunder at such time (it being understood that no partial face amount of any Letter of Credit may be so reallocated) and (ii) to the extent not reallocated pursuant to the immediately preceding clause (i) , the Borrower shall Cash Collateralize any such Letter of Credit in accordance with Section 2.03(f) . If, for any reason, such Cash Collateral is not provided or the reallocation does not occur, the Revolving Credit Lenders under the maturing Class shall continue to be responsible for their participating interests in the Letters of Credit. Except to the extent of reallocations of participations pursuant to clause (i) of the second preceding sentence, the occurrence of a Maturity Date with respect to a given Class of Revolving Credit Commitments shall have no effect upon (and shall not diminish) the percentage participations of the Revolving Credit Lenders in any Letter of Credit issued before such Maturity Date. Commencing with the Maturity Date of any Class of Revolving Credit Commitments, the sublimit for Letters of Credit shall be agreed with the Lenders under the extended or otherwise outstanding Classes. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything contained herein, the commitment of any L C Issuer to act in its capacity as such cannot be extended beyond the Initial Revolving Credit Maturity Date (as in effect at the Closing Date) or increased without its prior written consent.

permitted to be applied to any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, including the Law or any order of a jurisdiction where such L C Issuer or the beneficiary is located, the practice stated in the ISP or UCP, as applicable, or in the decisions, opinions, practice statements, or official commentary of the ICC Banking Commission, the Bankers Association for Finance and Trade International Financial Services Association (BAFT-IFSA), or the Institute of International Banking Law & Practice, whether or not any Letter of Credit chooses such law or practice. 
 (m) Letters of Credit Issued for Subsidiaries . Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder is in support of any obligations of, or is for the account of, a Restricted Subsidiary, the Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse the applicable L C Issuer hereunder for any and all drawings under such Letter of Credit.

 (b) If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be provided that, if such extension would 

cause payment of interest on or principal of Term SOFR Loans to be made in the next succeeding calendar month, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. 
 (c) Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the Administrative Agent, prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such payment and may (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto. If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds, then 
 (i) if the Borrower failed to make such payment, then the applicable Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender in Same Day Funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds at the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, it being understood that nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder and

If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent s demand therefor, the Administrative Agent may make a demand therefor upon the Borrower, and the Borrower shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent, together with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at the interest rate applicable to such Loan. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder. 
 A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this Section 2.12(c) shall be conclusive, absent demonstrable error.

(e) The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans and to fund participations in Letters of Credit are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to fund any such participation on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or purchase its participation. 
 (f) Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.

The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by 

applicable Law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff, but subject to Section 10.09 with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of demonstrable error) of participations purchased under this Section 2.13 and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments.

Commitments in respect of any Incremental Term Loans or Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments shall become Commitments under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, an Incremental Facility Amendment may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to any Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.14 .

 ARTICLE III Taxes, Increased Costs Protection and Illegality 
 Section 3.01. Taxes. 
 (a) Except as provided in this Section 3.01 , all payments by any Loan Party to or for the account of any Agent or any Lender under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Taxes unless required by applicable Law. If any applicable withholding agent shall be required by any Laws to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document, (i) if such Taxes are Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after all required deductions have been made (including any such deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.01 ), the applicable Lender (or, in the case of any amount received by an Agent for its own account, such Agent) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such applicable withholding agent shall make such deductions, (iii) such applicable withholding agent shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority or other authority in accordance with applicable Laws, and (iv) within thirty (30) days after the date of such payment by such applicable withholding agent (or, if receipts or evidence are not available within thirty (30) days, as soon as possible thereafter), such applicable withholding agent shall furnish to the Borrower and such Agent or Lender (as the case may be) the original or a facsimile copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof to the extent such a receipt is issued therefor, or other written proof of payment thereof that is reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 
 (b) In addition, but without duplication of any amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01(a) or (c) , the Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, all Other Taxes. 
 (c) Without duplication of any amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01(a) or Section 3.01(b) , the Borrower shall indemnify each Agent and each Lender for (i) the full amount of Indemnified Taxes (including any Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction in respect of amounts payable under this Section 3.01 payable by such Agent and such Lender and (ii) any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, in each case whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. Such Agent or Lender, as the case may be, will, at the Borrower s request, provide the Borrower with a written statement thereof setting forth in reasonable detail the basis and calculation of such amounts which shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Payment under this Section 3.01(c) shall be made within ten (10) days after the date such Lender or such Agent makes a demand therefor. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 3.01(c) , no Loan Party shall be required to indemnify any Agent or any Lender pursuant to this Section 3.01(c) for any incremental interest, penalties or expenses resulting from the failure of such Agent or Lender to notify the Loan Party of such possible indemnification claim within 180 days after such Agent or Lender receives written notice from the applicable Governmental Authority of the specific tax assessment giving rise to such indemnification claim. 
 (d) If any Lender or Agent determines, in its reasonable discretion, that it has received a refund in respect of any Indemnified Taxes as to which indemnification or additional amounts 

have been paid to it by any Loan Party pursuant to this Section 3.01 , it shall promptly remit an amount equal to such refund as soon as practicable after it is determined that such refund pertains to Indemnified Taxes (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Loan Party under this Section 3.01 with respect to the Indemnified Taxes giving rise to such refund plus any interest included in such refund by the relevant Governmental Authority attributable thereto) to the Borrower, net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including any Taxes) of the Lender or Agent, as the case may be and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund) provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Lender or Agent, as the case may be, agrees promptly to return an amount equal to such refund (plus any applicable interest, additions to tax or penalties) to such party in the event such party is required to repay such refund to the relevant Governmental Authority. Such Lender or Agent, as the case may be, shall, at the Borrower s request, provide the Borrower with a copy of any notice of assessment or other evidence of the requirement to repay such refund received from the relevant Governmental Authority provided that such Lender or Agent may delete any information therein that such Lender or Agent deems confidential). Nothing herein contained shall interfere with the right of a Lender or Agent to arrange its Tax affairs in whatever manner it thinks fit, nor oblige any Lender or Agent to claim any Tax refund or to make available its Tax returns or to disclose any information relating to its Tax affairs or any computations in respect thereof, nor require any Lender or Agent to do anything that would prejudice its ability to benefit from any other refunds, credits, reliefs, remissions or repayments to which it may be entitled. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.01(d) , in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 3.01(d) the payment of which would place such indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. 
 (e) Each Lender shall, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 3.01(a) or (c) with respect to such Lender, if requested by the Borrower, use commercially reasonable efforts (subject to legal and regulatory restrictions), at the Borrower s expense, to designate another Applicable Lending Office for any Loan affected by such event provided that such efforts are made on terms that, in the judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its Applicable Lending Office(s) to suffer no material economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, and provided , further , that nothing in this Section 3.01(e) shall affect or postpone any of the Obligations of the Borrower or the rights of such Lender pursuant to Section 3.01(a) or (c) . 
 (f) Each Lender shall, at such times as are reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, provide the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with any documentation prescribed by applicable Law, or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, certifying as to any entitlement of such Lender to an exemption from, or reduction in, any withholding Tax with respect to any payments to be made to such Lender under any Loan Document. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding sentence, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this Section 3.01(f) shall not be required if in the Lender s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. Each such Lender shall, whenever a lapse in time or change in circumstances renders such documentation (including any documentation specifically referenced below) expired, obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, deliver promptly to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent updated or other appropriate documentation (including any new documentation 

reasonably requested by the applicable withholding agent) or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its ineligibility to do so. 
 Without limiting the generality of the foregoing 
 (i) Each Lender that is a United States person (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or before the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement two properly completed and duly signed original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or any successor form) certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding 
 (ii) Each Lender that is not a United States person (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or before the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter when required by Law or upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) whichever of the following is applicable

 (C) in the case of a Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 871(h) or 881(c) or the Code, (x) a certificate, in substantially the form of Exhibit L (any such certificate a United States Tax Compliance Certificate ), or any other documentation approved by the Administrative Agent, to the effect that such Lender is not (1) a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (2) a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code or (3) a controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and that no payments under the Loan Documents are effectively connected with such Lender s conduct of a U.S. trade or business, and (y) two duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable (or any successor forms), 
 (D) to the extent a Lender is not the beneficial owner (for example, where the Lender is a partnership or a participating Lender), Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY (or any successor forms) of the Lender, accompanied by a Form W-8ECI, W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable (or any successor forms), a United States Tax Compliance Certificate, Form W-9, Form W-8IMY (or other successor forms) or any other required information from each beneficial owner, as applicable provided that, if the Lender is a partnership and not a participating Lender, and one or more direct or indirect partners are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, the United States Tax Compliance Certificate may be provided by such Lender on behalf of such direct or indirect partner(s)), or 
 (E) two duly completed copies of any other documentation prescribed by applicable U.S. federal income Tax Laws (including the Treasury regulations) as a basis 

for claiming a complete exemption from, or a reduction in, U.S. federal withholding Tax on any payments to such Lender under the Loan Documents. 
 (iii) If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Sections 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by applicable Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their FATCA obligations, to determine whether such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender s FATCA obligations and to determine the amount, if any, to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 3.01(f)(iii) , FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 3.01(f) , a Lender shall not be required to deliver any form that such Lender is not legally eligible to deliver. 
 Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to deliver to the Loan Parties and to any successor Administrative Agent any documentation provided by such Lender to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 3.01(f) . 
 (g) The Administrative Agent shall provide the Borrower with two duly completed original copies of, if it is a United States person (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code), Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 certifying that it is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding, and, if it is not a United States person, (i) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI with respect to payments to be received by it as a beneficial owner and (ii) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY (together with required accompanying documentation) with respect to payments to be received by it on behalf of the Lenders, and shall update such forms periodically upon the reasonable request of the Borrower. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 3.01(g) , the Administrative Agent shall not be required to deliver any documentation that such Administrative Agent is not legally eligible to deliver. 
 (h) Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand thereof, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 10.07(e) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to such Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph. 

(i) For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Section 3.01 , the term Lender includes any L C Issuer and the term applicable Law includes FATCA. 
 (j) Each party s obligations under this Section 3.01 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document. 
 Section 3.02. Inability to Determine Rates. 
 (a) If in connection with any request for a Term SOFR Loan or a conversion of Base Rate Loans to Term SOFR Loans or a continuation of any of such Loans, as applicable, (i) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that (A) no Successor Rate has been determined in accordance with Section 3.02(c) and the circumstances under clause (i) of Section 3.02(c) or the Scheduled Unavailability Date has occurred, or (B) adequate and reasonable means do not otherwise exist for determining Term SOFR for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Term SOFR or the determination of the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan, or (ii) the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders determine that for any reason that Term SOFR for any requested Interest Period does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. 
 (b) Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Term SOFR Loans, or to convert Base Rate Loans to Term SOFR Loans, shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Term SOFR Loans or Interest Periods) and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Term SOFR component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a determination by the Required Lenders described in clause (ii) of Section 3.02(a) , until the Administrative Agent upon instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. 
 Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, or conversion to, or continuation of Term SOFR Loans (to the extent of the affected Term SOFR Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein and (ii) any outstanding Term SOFR Loans shall be deemed to have been converted to Base Rate Loans immediately at the end of their respective applicable Interest Period. 
 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), or the Borrower or Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent (with, in the case of the Required Lenders, a copy to the Borrower) that the Borrower or Required Lenders (as applicable) have determined, that 
 (i) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining one month, three month or six month interest periods of Term SOFR, including, without limitation, because the Term SOFR Screen Rate is not available or published on a current basis and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary, or 

(ii) the Applicable Authority or any successor administrator of the Term SOFR Screen Rate has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which one month, three month and six month interest periods of Term SOFR or the Term SOFR Screen Rate shall or will no longer be representative or made available, or permitted to be used for determining the interest rate of Dollar denominated syndicated loans, or shall or will otherwise cease, provided that, in each case, at the time of such statement, there is no successor administrator that is satisfactory to the Administrative Agent that will continue to provide such interest period(s) of Term SOFR after such specific date (the latest date on which one month, three month and six month interest periods of Term SOFR or the Term SOFR Screen Rate are no longer representative or available permanently or indefinitely, the Scheduled Unavailability Date ), 
 then, on a date and time determined by the Administrative Agent (any such date, the Term SOFR Replacement Date ), which date shall be at the end of an Interest Period or on the relevant interest payment date, as applicable, for interest calculated and, solely with respect to clause (ii) above, no later than the Scheduled Unavailability Date, Term SOFR will be replaced hereunder and under any Loan Document with Daily Simple SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment for any payment period for interest calculated that can be determined by the Administrative Agent, in each case, without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document (the Successor Rate ). 
 If the Successor Rate is Daily Simple SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment, all interest payments will be payable on a monthly basis. 
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) if the Administrative Agent determines that Daily Simple SOFR is not available on or prior to the Term SOFR Replacement Date, or (ii) if the events or circumstances of the type described in Section 3.02(c) (i) or (ii) have occurred with respect to the Successor Rate then in effect, then in each case, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement solely for the purpose of replacing Term SOFR or any then current Successor Rate in accordance with this Section 3.02 at the end of any Interest Period, relevant interest payment date or payment period for interest calculated, as applicable, with an alternative benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar U.S. dollar denominated credit facilities syndicated and agented in the United States for such alternative benchmark and, in each case, including any mathematical or other adjustments to such benchmark giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar U.S. dollar denominated credit facilities syndicated and agented in the United States for such benchmark, which adjustment or method for calculating such adjustment shall be published on an information service as selected by the Administrative Agent from time to time in its reasonable discretion and may be periodically updated. For the avoidance of doubt, any such proposed rate and adjustments shall constitute a Successor Rate . Any such amendment shall become effective at 5 00 p.m. on the fifth Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Borrower unless, prior to such time, Lenders comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Required Lenders object to such amendment. 
 The Administrative Agent will promptly (in one or more notices) notify the Borrower and each Lender of the implementation of any Successor Rate. 
 Any Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner consistent with market practice provided that to the extent such market practice is not administratively feasible for the Administrative 

Agent, such Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent (in consultation with the Borrower). 
 Notwithstanding anything else herein, if at any time any Successor Rate as so determined would otherwise be less than zero, the Successor Rate will be deemed to be zero for the purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 
 In connection with the implementation of a Successor Rate, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time, in consultation with the Borrower, and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement provided that, with respect to any such amendment effected, the Administrative Agent shall post each such amendment implementing such Conforming Changes to the Borrower and the Lenders reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective. 
 Section 3.03. Increased Cost and Reduced Return Capital Adequacy. 
 (a) If any Lender determines that as a result of any Change in Law, or such Lender s compliance therewith, there shall be any increase in the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding, maintaining, continuing or converting to any Loan or issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or a reduction in the amount received or receivable by such Lender in connection with any of the foregoing (excluding for purposes of this Section 3.03(a) any such increased costs or reduction in amount resulting from (i) Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes indemnifiable under Section 3.01 or (ii) Excluded Taxes), then from time to time within fifteen (15) days after demand by such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail such increased costs (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent given in accordance with Section 3.05 ), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction provided that in the case of any Change in Law only applicable as a result of the proviso set forth in the definition thereof, such Lender will only be compensated for such amounts that would have otherwise been imposed under the applicable increased cost provisions and only to the extent the applicable Lender certifies that it is its general policy or practice to impose such charges on other similarly situated borrowers under comparable syndicated credit facilities. 
 (b) If any Lender determines that as a result of any Change in Law regarding capital adequacy or liquidity requirements or any change therein or in the interpretation thereof, in each case after the Closing Date, or compliance by such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) therewith, has the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of such Lender s obligations hereunder (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy and such Lender s desired return on capital), then from time to time upon demand of such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the charge and the calculation of such reduced rate of return (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent given in accordance with Section 3.05 ), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction within thirty (30) days after receipt of such demand. 
 (c) Subject to Section 3.05(b) , failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 3.03 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s right to demand such compensation. 

(d) If any Lender requests compensation under this Section 3.03 , then such Lender will, if requested by the Borrower, use commercially reasonable efforts to designate another Applicable Lending Office for any Loan or Letter of Credit affected by such event provided that such efforts are made on terms that, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its Applicable Lending Office(s) to suffer no material economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage and provided , further that nothing in this Section 3.03(d) shall affect or postpone any of the Obligations of the Borrower or the rights of such Lender pursuant to Section 3.03(a) , (b) or (c) . 
 Section 3.04. Funding Losses. Promptly following written demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, which demand shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting such amount, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense (excluding loss of anticipated profits) actually incurred by it as a result of 
 (a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of any Interest Period, relevant interest payment date or payment period, as applicable, for such Loan, if applicable (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration or otherwise) 
 (b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower or 
 (c) any assignment of a Term SOFR Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 3.06 , 
 including any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. 
 Section 3.05. Matters Applicable to All Requests for Compensation. 
 (a) Any Agent or any Lender claiming compensation under this Article III shall deliver a certificate to the Borrower setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder which shall be conclusive in the absence of demonstrable error. In determining such amount, such Agent or such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. 
 (b) With respect to any Lender s claim for compensation under Section 3.01 , Section 3.03 or Section 3.04 the Borrower shall not be required to compensate such Lender for any amount incurred more than one hundred and eighty (180) days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the event that gives rise to such claim provided that, if the circumstance giving rise to such claim is retroactive, then such 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. If any Lender requests compensation by the Borrower under Section 3.03 , the Borrower may, by notice to such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), suspend the obligation of such Lender to make or continue Term SOFR Loans from one Interest Period to another, or to convert Base Rate Loans into Term SOFR Loans, until the event or condition giving rise to such request ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of Section 3.05(c) shall be applicable) provided that such suspension shall not affect the right of such Lender to receive the compensation so requested. 

(c) If the obligation of any Lender to make or continue any Term SOFR Loan from one Interest Period to another, or to convert Base Rate Loans into Term SOFR Loans shall be suspended pursuant to Section 3.05(b) hereof, such Lender s Term SOFR Loans shall be automatically converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for such Term SOFR Loans (or, in the case of an immediate conversion required by Section 3.02 , on such earlier date as required by Law) and, unless and until such Lender gives notice as provided below that the circumstances specified in Section 3.02 , Section 3.03 or Section 3.04 hereof that gave rise to such conversion no longer exist 
 (i) to the extent that such Lender s Term SOFR Loans have been so converted, all payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise be applied to such Lender s Term SOFR Loans shall be applied instead to its Base Rate Loans and 
 (ii) all Loans that would otherwise be made or continued from one Interest Period to another by such Lender as Term SOFR Loans shall be made or continued instead as Base Rate Loans, and all Base Rate Loans of such Lender that would otherwise be converted into Term SOFR Loans shall remain as Base Rate Loans. 
 (d) If any Lender gives notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) that the circumstances specified in Section 3.02 , Section 3.03 or Section 3.04 hereof that gave rise to the conversion of such Lender s Term SOFR Loans pursuant to this Section 3.05 no longer exist (which such Lender agrees to do promptly upon such circumstances ceasing to exist) at a time when Term SOFR Loans made by other Lenders are outstanding, such Lender s Base Rate Loans shall be automatically converted into Term SOFR Loans, on the first day(s) of the next succeeding Interest Period(s) for such outstanding Term SOFR Loans, to the extent necessary so that, after giving effect thereto, all Loans held by the Lenders holding Term SOFR Loans and by such Lender are held pro rata (as to principal amounts, interest rate basis and Interest Periods) in accordance with their respective principal amount of Commitments. 
 Section 3.06. Replacement of Lenders under Certain Circumstances. 
 (a) If at any time (i) any Lender requests reimbursement for amounts owing pursuant to Section 3.01 or Section 3.03 as a result of any condition described in such Sections and Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 3.01(e) or any Lender ceases to make Term SOFR Loans as a result of any condition described in Section 3.02 or Section 3.03 , (ii) any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, (iii) any Lender becomes a Non-Consenting Lender or (iv) any Lender becomes a Non-Extending Lender, then the Borrower may, on prior written notice to the Administrative Agent and such Lender, replace such Lender by requiring such Lender to (and such Lender shall be obligated to) assign pursuant to Section 10.07(b) (with the assignment fee to be paid by the Borrower in such instance) all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (or, with respect to clause (iii) and clause (iv) above, all of its rights and obligations with respect to the Class of Loans or Commitments that is the subject of the related consent, waiver or amendment) to one or more Eligible Assignees for a purchase price equal to the principal amount of all of such Lender s outstanding Loans plus any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and accrued but unpaid fees for the account of such Lender hereunder provided that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation to the Borrower to find a replacement Lender or other such Person and provided , further , that (A) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.03 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.01 , such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments and (B) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a Lender becoming 

a Non-Consenting Lender or a Non-Extending Lender, the applicable Eligible Assignees shall have agreed to the applicable extension, waiver or amendment of the Loan Documents). 
 (b) Any Lender being replaced pursuant to Section 3.06(a) above shall (i) execute and deliver an Assignment and Assumption with respect to such Lender s Commitment and outstanding Loans and participations in L C Obligations, as applicable provided that the failure of any such Lender to execute an Assignment and Assumption shall not render such assignment invalid and such assignment shall be recorded in the Register) and (ii) deliver Notes, if any, evidencing such Loans to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent. Pursuant to such Assignment and Assumption, (A) the assignee Lender shall acquire all or a portion, as the case may be, of the assigning Lender s Commitments and outstanding Loans and participations in L C Obligations, as applicable, (B) all obligations of the Loan Parties owing to the assigning Lender relating to the Loan Documents and participations so assigned shall be paid in full by the assignee Lender or the Loan Parties (as applicable) to such assigning Lender concurrently with such assignment and assumption, any amounts owing to the assigning Lender (other than a Defaulting Lender) under Section 3.04 as a consequence of such assignment shall have been paid by the Borrower to the assigning Lender and (C) upon such payment and, if so requested by the assignee Lender, the assignor Lender shall deliver to the assignee Lender the appropriate Notes executed by the Borrower, the assignee Lender shall become a Lender hereunder and the assigning Lender shall cease to constitute a Lender hereunder with respect to such assigned Loans, Commitments and participations, except with respect to indemnification provisions under this Agreement, which shall survive as to such assigning Lender. 
 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above, any Lender that acts as an L C Issuer may not be replaced hereunder at any time that it has any Letter of Credit outstanding hereunder unless arrangements reasonably satisfactory to such L C Issuer (including the furnishing of a back-up standby letter of credit in form and substance, and issued by an issuer reasonably satisfactory to such L C Issuer, or the depositing of cash collateral into a cash collateral account in amounts and pursuant to arrangements reasonably satisfactory to such L C Issuer) have been made with respect to each such outstanding Letter of Credit and the Lender that acts as the Administrative Agent may not be replaced hereunder except in accordance with the terms of Section 9.09 . 
 (d) In the event that (i) the Borrower or the Administrative Agent has requested that the Lenders consent to a departure or waiver of any provisions of the Loan Documents or agree to any amendment thereto, (ii) the consent, waiver or amendment in question requires the agreement of all affected Lenders in accordance with the terms of Section 10.01 or all the Lenders of a certain Class and (iii) the Required Lenders, Required Revolving Credit Lenders or , Required Initial Term Lenders or Required Fourth Amendment Incremental Term Lenders, as applicable, have agreed to such consent, waiver or amendment, then any Lender who does not agree to such consent, waiver or amendment shall be deemed a Non-Consenting Lender . 
 (e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each party hereto agrees that any assignment pursuant to the terms of this Section 3.06 may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the assignee Lender and that the Lender making such assignment need not be a party thereto. 
 Section 3.07. Illegality. If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to SOFR or Term SOFR or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to engage in revert repurchase of U.S. Treasury securities transactions of the type included 

in the determination of SOFR or Term SOFR, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon SOFR or Term SOFR, then, on written notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (a) any obligation of such Lender to make or maintain Term SOFR Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Term SOFR Loans shall be, in each case, suspended, and (b) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the Borrower shall promptly, following written demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Term SOFR Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Term SOFR Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Term SOFR Loans, and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon SOFR or Term SOFR, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Term SOFR component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon SOFR or Term SOFR. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, and all amounts due, if any, in connection with such prepayment or conversion under Section 3.04 . Each Lender agrees to designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender. 
 Section 3.08. Survival. All of the Borrower s obligations under this Article III shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments and repayment of all other Obligations hereunder and any assignment of rights by or replacement of a Lender.

Upon the acceptance of any appointment as the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent hereunder by a successor and upon the execution and filing or recording of such financing statements, or amendments thereto, and such amendments or supplements to other instruments or notices, as may be necessary or desirable, or as the Required Lenders may reasonably request, in order to (a) continue the perfection of the Liens granted or purported to be granted by the Collateral Documents or (b) otherwise ensure that the Collateral and Guarantee Requirement is satisfied, the successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, discretion, privileges, and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall, to the extent not previously discharged, be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents.

 Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize any Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to authorize any Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding.
