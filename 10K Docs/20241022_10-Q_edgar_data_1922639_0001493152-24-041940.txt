EXPLANATORY
NOTE 

Unless
otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, all references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Report to we, us, our, Permex, and the Company are to Permex Petroleum
Corporation., a corporation existing under the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada, and our wholly-owned subsidiary. 

Unless
otherwise indicated in this Report, natural gas volumes are stated at the legal pressure base of the state or geographic area in which
the reserves are located at 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Crude oil and natural gas equivalents are determined using the ratio of six Mcf of
natural gas to one barrel of crude oil, condensate or natural gas liquids. 

The
following definitions shall apply to the technical terms used in this Report. 

Terms
used to describe quantities of crude oil and natural gas: 

Bbl . 
One stock tank barrel, of 42 U.S. gallons liquid volume, used herein in reference to crude oil, condensate or NGLs. 

Boe . 
A barrel of oil equivalent and is a standard convention used to express crude oil, NGL and natural gas volumes on a comparable crude
oil equivalent basis. Gas equivalents are determined under the relative energy content method by using the ratio of 6.0 Mcf of natural
gas to 1.0 Bbl of crude oil or NGL. 

MBoe 
One thousand barrels of oil equivalent. 

MBbl . 
One thousand barrels of crude oil, condensate or NGLs. 

Mcf . 
One thousand cubic feet of natural gas. 

NGLs . 
Natural gas liquids. Hydrocarbons found in natural gas that may be extracted as liquefied petroleum gas and natural gasoline. 

Terms
used to describe our interests in wells and acreage: 

Basin . 
A large natural depression on the earth s surface in which sediments generally brought by water accumulate. 

Completion. 
The process of treating a drilled well followed by the installation of permanent equipment for the production of crude oil, NGLs, and/or
natural gas. 

Developed
acreage. Acreage consisting of leased acres spaced or assignable to productive wells. Acreage included in spacing units of
infill wells is classified as developed acreage at the time production commences from the initial well in the spacing unit. As such,
the addition of an infill well does not have any impact on a company s amount of developed acreage. 

Development
well. A well drilled within the proved area of a crude oil, NGL, or natural gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic
horizon (rock layer or formation) known to be productive for the purpose of extracting proved crude oil, NGL, or natural gas reserves. 

Differential. 
The difference between a benchmark price of crude oil and natural gas, such as the NYMEX crude oil spot price, and the wellhead price
received. 

Dry
hole . A well found to be incapable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities such that proceeds from the sale of
such production exceed production expenses and taxes. 

Field . 
An area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on, or related to, the same individual geological structural
feature or stratigraphic condition. The field name refers to the surface area, although it may refer to both the surface and the underground
productive formations. 

Formation . 
A layer of rock which has distinct characteristics that differs from nearby rock. 

Gross
acres or Gross wells. The total acres or wells, as the case may be, in which a working interest is owned. 

Held
by operations. A provision in an oil and gas lease that extends the stated term of the lease as long as drilling operations
are ongoing on the property. 

Held
by production or HBP A provision in an oil and gas lease that extends the stated term of the lease as
long as the property produces a minimum quantity of crude oil, NGLs, and natural gas. 

3 

 Table of Contents 

Hydraulic
fracturing . The technique of improving a well s production by pumping a mixture of fluids into the formation and rupturing
the rock, creating an artificial channel. As part of this technique, sand or other material may also be injected into the formation to
keep the channel open, so that fluids or natural gases may more easily flow through the formation. 

Infill
well. A subsequent well drilled in an established spacing unit of an already established productive well in the spacing unit.
Acreage on which infill wells are drilled is considered developed commencing with the initial productive well established in the spacing
unit. As such, the addition of an infill well does not have any impact on a company s amount of developed acreage. 

Net
acres. The percentage ownership of gross acres. Net acres are deemed to exist when the sum of fractional ownership working
interests in gross acres equals one (e.g., a 10 working interest in a lease covering 640 gross acres is equivalent to 64 net acres). 

NYMEX . 
The New York Mercantile Exchange. 

Productive
well . A well that is found to be capable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities such that proceeds from the sale
of the production exceed production expenses and taxes. 

Recompletion . 
The process of treating a drilled well followed by the installation of permanent equipment for the production of crude oil, NGLs or natural
gas or, in the case of a dry hole, the reporting of abandonment to the appropriate agency. 

Reservoir . 
A porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation of producible crude oil, NGLs and/or natural gas that
is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is separate from other reservoirs. 

Spacing . 
The distance between wells producing from the same reservoir. Spacing is often expressed in terms of acres, e.g., 40-acre spacing, and
is often established by regulatory agencies. 

Undeveloped
acreage . Leased acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of economic
quantities of crude oil, NGLs, and natural gas, regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. Undeveloped acreage includes
net acres held by operations until a productive well is established in the spacing unit. 

Unit . 
The joining of all or substantially all interests in a reservoir or field, rather than a single tract, to provide for development and
operation without regard to separate property interests. Also, the area covered by a unitization agreement. 

Wellbore . 
The hole drilled by the bit that is equipped for natural gas production on a completed well. Also called well or borehole. 

4 

 Table of Contents 

Working
interest . The right granted to the lessee of a property to explore for and to produce and own crude oil, NGLs, natural gas
or other minerals. The working interest owners bear the exploration, development, and operating costs on either a cash, penalty, or carried
basis. 

Workover. 
 Operations on a producing well to restore or increase production. 

Terms
used to assign a present value to or to classify our reserves: 

Possible
reserves. The additional reserves which analysis of geoscience and engineering data suggest are less likely to be recoverable
than probable reserves. 

Pre-tax
PV-10 or PV-10. The estimated future net revenue, discounted at a rate of 10 per annum, before income taxes and with no
price or cost escalation or de-escalation in accordance with guidelines promulgated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
(the SEC ). 

Probable
reserves. The additional reserves which analysis of geoscience and engineering data indicate are less likely to be recovered
than proved reserves but which together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. 

Proved
reserves . The quantities of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, which, by analysis of geosciences and engineering data, can be
estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible, from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing
economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations, prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate
expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are
used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that
it will commence the project within a reasonable time. 

Proved
undeveloped reserves or PUDs . Proved Reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled
acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Reserves on undrilled acreage are
limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence
using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances. Undrilled locations
can be classified as having proved undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled
to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time. Estimates for proved undeveloped reserves are
not attributed to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless
such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or by other evidence using
reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty. 

SEC
Pricing means pricing calculated using oil and natural gas price parameters established by current guidelines of the SEC and
accounting rules based on the unweighted arithmetic average of oil and natural gas prices as of the first day of each of the 12 months
ended on the given date.

CAUTIONARY
NOTICE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 

We
desire to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. This Report
contains a number of forward-looking statements that reflect management s current views and expectations with respect to our business,
strategies, products, future results and events, and financial performance. All statements made in this Report other than statements
of historical fact, including statements that address operating performance, the economy, events or developments that management expects
or anticipates will or may occur in the future, including the adequacy of funds from operations, cash flows and financing, potential
strategic transactions, statements regarding future operating results and non-historical information, are forward-looking statements.
In particular, the words such as believe, expect, intend, anticipate, estimate, 
 may, will, can, plan, predict, could, future, 
 continue, variations of such words, and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, but are not the exclusive
means of identifying such statements and their absence does not mean that the statement is not forward-looking. 

When
considering forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements described under the
heading Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. These forward-looking
statements are based on management s current belief, based on currently available information, as to the outcome and timing of
future events. 

Forward-looking
statements may include statements about: 

our
 business strategy; 

our
 reserves; 

our
 financial strategy, liquidity and capital requirements; 

our
 realized or expected natural gas prices; 

our
 timing and amount of future production of natural gas; 

our
 future drilling plans and cost estimates; 

our
 competition and government regulations; 

our
 ability to make acquisitions; 

general
 economic conditions; 

our
 future operating results; and 

our
 future plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. 

We
caution you that these forward-looking statements are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict
and many of which are beyond our control, incident to the exploration for and development, production and sale of natural gas. These
risks include, but are not limited to, commodity price volatility, lack of availability of drilling and production equipment and services,
environmental risks, drilling and other operating risks, regulatory changes, the uncertainty inherent in estimating natural gas reserves
and in projecting future rates of production, cash flow and access to capital, the timing of development expenditures, and the other
risks described under the heading Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30,
2023. 

Reserve
engineering is a method of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy
of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data, the interpretation of such data and price and cost assumptions made
by reserve engineers. In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production activities may justify revisions of previous estimates.
If significant, such revisions would change the schedule of any further production and development drilling. Accordingly, reserve estimates
may differ significantly from the quantities of natural gas and oil that are ultimately recovered. 

Should
one or more of the risks or uncertainties described in this Report occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual
results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. 

All
forward-looking statements, expressed or implied, included in this Report are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary
statement. This cautionary statement should also be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements
that we or persons acting on our behalf may issue. 

Except
as otherwise required by applicable law, we disclaim any duty to update any forward-looking statements, all of which are expressly qualified
by the statements in this section, to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Report. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
public statements or disclosures by us following this Report that modify or impact any of the forward-looking statements contained in
this Report will be deemed to modify or supersede such statements in this Report.

, has a working capital deficiency of 
as of June 30, 2024 and has not yet achieved profitable operations. The Company requires equity or debt financings to fund its operation,
which it has been unable to secure in sufficient amounts to date, and there can be no assurances that it will be able to do so in the
future. The aforementioned factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one
year after the date that the financial statements are issued. 

The
Company expects to raise additional funds through equity and debt financings. There is no assurance that such financing will be available
in the future. During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Company raised through the issuance of convertible debentures.
These debentures had a maturity date of but are currently in default due to the Company s failure to repay the
principal and accrued interest on the maturity date. The Company is currently negotiating a debt restructuring plan with the debenture
holders. Subsequent to June 30, 2024, the Company received in subscription proceeds through additional debt financing. Management
believes that this plan provides an opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern subject to its continued ability to raise
funds to maintain its operations and manage its working capital deficiency. 

In
view of these matters, continuation as a going concern is dependent upon continued operations of the Company, which in turn is dependent
upon the Company s ability to, meet its financial requirements, raise additional capital, and the success of its future operations.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amount and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary
should the Company not continue as a going concern.

The
Company allocated the proceeds received from the issuance of the convertible debentures and warrants between the debt and equity components
based on their relative fair values at the issuance date. Due to the lack of an active market for the Company s privately placed

the convertible debentures could not be obtained. Accordingly, the face value of the debentures is considered to be a reasonable approximation
of their fair value at the issuance date. The fair value of the warrants issued was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model (assuming a risk-free interest rate of , an expected life of , annualized volatility of and a dividend rate

various factors, including the risks outlined at the beginning of this Report under Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking

Reserve
engineering is a method of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy
of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data, the interpretation of such data and price and cost assumptions made
by reserve engineers. In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production activities may justify revisions of previous estimates.
If significant, such revisions would change the schedule of any further production and development drilling. Accordingly, reserve estimates
may differ significantly from the quantities of natural gas and oil that are ultimately recovered.

Company acquired the Mary Bullard Property in August 2017 for a cash consideration of approximately 50,000. The Mary Bullard Property
is located in Stonewall County, about 5 miles southwest of Aspermont, Texas. It is bounded on the north by King County, on
the east by Haskell County, on the south by Fisher and Jones Counties, and on the west by Kent County. The asset is situated on the Eastern
Shelf of the Midland Basin in the central part of the North Central Plains. The Mary Bullard Property covers 241 acres held by production
and is productive in the Clearfork formation at a depth of approximately 3,200 feet. There is currently one producing well, four shut-in
wells, and two water injection wells. The Company holds a 100 working interest in the Mary Bullard Property and a 78.625 net revenue
interest. These assets were shut-in in April 2024 and remain shut in pending successful capital raising of the Company. 

West
Henshaw Property - New Mexico 

The
West Henshaw Property is located in Eddy County, New Mexico, 12 miles northeast of Loco Hills in the Delaware Basin. Eddy County is in
Southeast New Mexico. It is bounded by Chaves County to the north, Otero County to the east, Loving County, Texas to the south, and Lea
County to the west. The West Henshaw Property covers 1,880 acres held by production. There are two producing wells, seven shut-in wells
and four saltwater disposal wells. The Company holds a 100 working interest in the West Henshaw Property and a 72 net revenue interest. 

In
January 2022, the Company began the pilot re-entry on the West Henshaw well #15-3, one out of the 67 shut-in wells it currently owns.
The re-entry and re-stimulation involved the West Henshaw property targeting the Grayburg formation at a depth of 2,850 feet. The recompletion
was successful and came online at an initial rate of 30 bopd and has stabilized at 15 bopd. 

In
April 2022, the Company began the re-entry on the West Henshaw well #6-10. The re-entry and re-stimulation involved the West Henshaw
property targeting the Grayburg formation at a depth of 2,850 feet. The recompletion was successful and came online at an initial rate
of 15 bopd and has stabilized at 10 bopd. Throughout 2023, the Company completed a number of re-entry and basic workover efforts to try
and establish more steady production from the West Henshaw assets. These assets were shut-in in April 2024 and remain shut in pending
successful capital raising of the Company. 

The
remaining 67 shut-in wells that the Company plans to re-enter have potential to yield similar results increasing our total daily production
solely by re-entering shut-in wells.

Conversion
of Undeveloped Acreage 

The
Company s process for converting undeveloped acreage to developed acreage is tied to whether there is any drilling being conducted
on the acreage in question. The Company has started development and conversion of its undeveloped acreage located in Martin County, Texas.
The PPC Eoff #3 well, operated by Permex Petroleum, is the first of two permitted wells to be drilled by the Company on the 7,780 gross
acre Breedlove oilfield. Drilling of the first well commenced on September 14, 2022. Management expects to restart its drilling and development
program in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to receipt of additional funding. 

An
aggregate of 1,609 MBO and 1,277 MMCF, of the Company s proved undeveloped reserves as of September 30, 2023, are part of a development
plan that has been adopted by management that calls for these undeveloped reserves to be drilled within the next five years, thus resulting
in the conversion of such proved undeveloped reserves to developed status within five years of initial disclosure at September 30, 2023.
Management currently anticipates spending approximately 0.5 million in capital expenditures towards developing the Company s proved
undeveloped reserves during the 2024 fiscal year, subject to the Company acquiring the necessary financing. 

Financing
of Proved and Probable Undeveloped Reserves 

The
Company currently estimates that the total cost to develop the Company s proved undeveloped reserves of 1,609.7 MBbl of oil and
1,277.1 Mcf of natural gas as of September 30, 2023 is 15,710,000. The Company expects to finance these capital costs through a combination
of current cash on hand, debt financing through a line of credit or similar debt instrument, one or more offerings of debt or equity,
and from cash generated from estimated revenues from sales of oil and natural gas produced at the Company s wells. 

The
Company currently estimates that the total cost to develop the Company s probable undeveloped reserves of 9,290.4 MBbl of oil and
10,882.8 Mcf of natural gas as of September 30, 2023 is 134,428,500. The Company expects to finance these capital costs through a combination
of joint ventures, farm-in agreements, direct participation programs, one or more offerings of equity, a debt offering or entering into
a line of credit, and from cash generated from estimated revenues from sales of oil and natural gas produced at the Company s wells.
Management does not currently anticipate any capital expenditures towards developing the Company s probable undeveloped reserves
in the next twelve months. 

Drilling
Activities 

The
Company drilled one well during the last three fiscal years. As at September 30, 2023, the Company had 103 gross wells and 23 net productive
wells. The Company s gross developed acreage totaled 5,177 and net developed acreage totaled 3,942 with the following property

Operating
Results 

Three
Months Ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 

During
the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company reported a net loss of 1,248,755, compared to a net loss of 909,593 for the same
quarter in 2023. The increase in loss in 2024 was mostly as a result of lower revenue and higher other expenses, which more than offset
the reduction in operating expenses during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The Company reported interest and debt expenses of 97,191
(2023 - 1,026) related to debenture loans issued during the 2024 quarter and a loss on debt extinguishment of 495,051 (2023 - nil)
due to the modification of the number of warrants issued with a debenture loan. 

The
Company reported oil and gas sales revenue of nil in the third quarter of the current fiscal year compared to 156,716 in the same quarter
of the previous fiscal year. The decrease in revenue is due to the shutdown of oil and gas production across all fields, resulting from
financial constraints that impacted field operations. Net oil-equivalent production by final product sold in the current quarter was
nil, compared to 35.80 barrels per day in the same quarter of last year. 

The
Company s total operating expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was 664,330 compared to 1,069,450 for the same period
in 2023. Lease operating expenses decreased to 10,421 from 235,511 in the comparative period due to the production shutdown. General
and administrative expenses for the three month period ended June 30, 2024 were 629,836, compared to 788,659 for the same quarter in
the prior fiscal year. The decrease in accounting, audit and legal fees is attributable to a reduction in overall activity. Investor
relations and marketing expenses also decreased as management scaled back these efforts. However, consulting fees increased as the Company
engaged a consultant for merger and acquisition activities. Additionally, salaries rose due to the appointment of a new CEO during the
quarter, with an annual salary of 250,000 and a one-time sign-on bonus of 50,000.

Nine
Months Ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 

During
the nine months ended June 30, 2024, the Company reported a net loss of 2,415,991 compared to a net loss of 3,330,107 for the same
period in 2023. The net loss for the first nine months of current fiscal year was mainly attributable to operating expenses of 1,922,466
compared to operating expenses of 3,921,416 in the prior year, and other expenses of 580,181, compared to other income of 31,710 in
2023. These losses were partially offset by revenue from oil and gas sales and royalty income of 86,656, compared to 559,599 in the
same period of fiscal 2023. Other expense for the 2024 period mainly consists of interest and debt expenses of 98,217 (2023 - 2,208)
related to debenture loans issued during the 2024 period and a non-cash loss on debt extinguishment of 495,051 (2023 - nil) due to
the modification of the number of warrants issued with a debenture loan. 

The
Company reported oil and gas sales revenue of 75,466 in the first nine months of the current fiscal year compared to 541,459 in the
same period last year. The decrease was due to reduced oil and gas production across all fields, resulting from financial constraints
that impacted field operations. Net oil-equivalent production by final product sold in the current period averaged 5.39 barrels per day,
compared with 37.59 barrels per day in the same period of the previous fiscal year. 

The
lease operating expenses for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 were 165,305 compared with 762,668 in the nine months ended June 30,
2023. The decrease in lease operating expenses is attributed to reduced production in the current period compared to the same period
in the previous fiscal year. Lease operating expenses exceeded oil and gas sales revenue mainly due to significant maintenance expenses
on the West Henshaw wells.

 Table of Contents 

General
and administrative expenses for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 were 1,674,738, compared with 3,014,307 in the nine months ended
June 30, 2023. The significant reduction is mainly due to the decreased property development and corporate activities during the current
period, as management scaled back operations in response to tighter financial constraints. Specifically, the variance from the prior
year was mainly attributable: 

Accounting
 and audit fees of 247,697, which decreased from 697,109 in the first nine months of the prior fiscal year. The decrease was largely
 due to a significant decrease in overall activities. A substantial portion of the fees in the current period was related to regulatory
 compliance work associated with the proposed U.S. uplisting in November 2023. 

Legal
 fees of 349,111 in the current period, down from 545,911 in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The legal fees mainly related
 to the regulatory work associated with the Company s proposed uplisting to the NASDAQ in November 2023 as well as compliance
 with the disclosure requirements under the Exchange Act in the United States. 

Marketing,
 investor relations, news and media, and promotion expenses of 85,288 in the current period, compared to 633,891 in the same period
 of the previous fiscal year. The reduction was due to the Company scaling back marketing and promotion activities. 

Salaries
 and benefits for the current period totaled 391,728, compared to 329,940 in the previous year. Of this amount, 340,594 was allocated
 to management salaries, an increase from 252,305 in 2023, while 51,134 was spent on administrative salaries, down from 77,635
 in the previous year. The increase in management salaries was due to the appointment of a new CEO in April 2024, with an annual salary
 of 250,000 and a one-time sign-on bonus of 50,000. 

Travel
 expenses of 29,660 in the current period compared to 131,914 in the same period of the
 previous fiscal year. The reduction was due to reduced travel by management for marketing
 and promotion activities. 

Update
on Use of Proceeds 

During
the nine months ended June 30, 2024, the Company completed two tranches of the private placement of convertible debenture units for gross
proceeds of 1,365,000. The net proceeds were intended for potential mergers and acquisitions, general working capital, preparing and
filing all outstanding financial statements and continuous disclosure records, paying revocation related legal and filing fees, settling
outstanding amounts under certain claim judgments. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company has fully utilized 1,365,000 of the net proceeds. The following table provides the Company s
use of these proceeds.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of June 30, 2024, the Company had a cash balance of 428,385, an increase of 345,649 from the cash balance of 82,736 on September 30,
2023. During the nine months ended June 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 1,124,351, primarily covering accounting, insurance,
salary and general office expenses. The Company received 1,365,000 from debenture financings, 70,000 from reclamation deposit redemption,
and 45,000 from a related party loan, while repaying 10,000 on a third-party loan. 

The
Company had a working capital deficiency of 4,480,663 as of June 30, 2024 compared to a working capital deficiency of 3,142,916 as
of September 30, 2023. The Company will need substantial additional funding to pay the outstanding payables and bring the operated
assets back to production. This raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The
company has decreased its activity to a minimal level to minimize the expected increases in additional balances to the working
capital deficiency. The company has dramatically limited its ongoing commitments and account demands going forward and expects a
meaningful reduction in the rate of increase of the working capital deficiency account. Additionally, the company is actively
engaging with its trade partners to remedy its working capital deficiency through all means available to it including but not
limited to financing arrangements, payment plans, and principal reductions.

 Table of Contents 

Management
has budgeted approximately 1.5 million in minimum operating expenses and 0.5 million in capital expenditures for the next 12 months,
which the Company plans to finance principally from one or more equity or debt financings. The purpose of these funds will be to resume
full field operations, reduce the working capital deficit, as well as invest in additional oil and gas production activities across the
company s assets. This capital can be adjusted as necessary based on economic or business factors. The amount and timing of capital
expenditures will depend on several factors including, but not limited to, the speed with which we are able to bring our wells to production,
our ability to complete an equity financing or to secure a suitable line of credit, commodity prices, supply/demand considerations and
attractive rates of return. There are no guarantees that we will be able to acquire the necessary funds to meet our budgeted capital
expenditures, and any postponement of our planned development of our proved undeveloped reserves could materially affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations. 

Although
the Company has budgeted investments of additional capital in the continued development of our oil and gas operations, the Company currently
does not have any material commitments for capital expenditures. As of the date of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the nine months
ended June 30, 2024, the Company does not have sufficient working capital to meet its anticipated operating and capital requirements
over the next 12 months. Subsequent to June 30, 2024, the Company received 2.4 million in financing proceeds. The Company will also
continue to monitor the current economic and financial market conditions and evaluate their impact on the Company s liquidity and
future prospects. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Management evaluates these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and bases its estimates on experience, current
and expected future conditions, third-party evaluations and various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the
circumstances. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates address all important accounting areas where the
nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly
uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. 

Oil
and natural gas reserves 

Crude
oil and natural gas reserves are estimates of future production that impact certain asset and expense accounts included in the consolidated
financial statements. Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with
reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government
regulations. Proved reserves include both developed and undeveloped volumes. Proved developed reserves represent volumes expected to
be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are volumes expected to
be recovered from new wells on undrilled proved acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for
recompletion. Variables impacting the Company s estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include field performance,
available technology, commodity prices, and development, production and carbon costs. 

The
estimation of proved reserves is important to the consolidated statements of operations because the proved reserve estimate for a field
serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of the depletion of the capitalized costs for that asset. If the estimates
of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 10 percent across all calculations, the depletion in
the 2024 period would have increased by approximately 1,800. 

Impairment 

The
Company tests long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the
assets. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are
largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets, generally on a field-by-field basis for oil and gas assets. Because
there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based
on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates and prices believed to be consistent with those used by principal
market participants. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on estimated
future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs and capital decisions, considering all available evidence at the date of
review. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment in any period. 

31 

 Table of Contents 

Asset
retirement obligations 

The
Company is subject to retirement obligations for certain assets. The fair values of these obligations are recorded as liabilities on
a discounted basis, which is typically at the time the assets are installed. In the estimation of fair value, the Corporation uses assumptions
and judgments regarding such factors as the existence of a legal obligation for an asset retirement obligation, technical assessments
of the assets, estimated amounts and timing of settlements, discount rates, and inflation rates. 

A
sensitivity analysis of the ARO impact on earnings is not practicable, given the broad range of the company s long-lived
assets and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. Favorable changes to some assumptions would have reduced estimated future
obligations, thereby lowering accretion expense and amortization costs, whereas unfavorable changes would have the opposite effect.

JOBS
Act 

On
April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take
advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting
standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those
standards would otherwise apply to private companies. 

We
have chosen to take advantage of the extended transition periods available to emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act for complying
with new or revised accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies provided under the JOBS Act.
As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates for
complying with new or revised accounting standards. 

Subject
to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company, we intend to rely on certain of these exemptions,
including, without limitation, (i) providing an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial
reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional
information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We will remain an emerging
growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of 1.235
billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our initial public offering; (iii)
the date on which we have issued more than 1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which
we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC.

 QUANTITATIVE
 AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

The
Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a smaller reporting company, as defined
in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act.

 CONTROLS
 AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation
 of disclosure controls and procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in
the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management, under
the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of
the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period
covered by this Report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2024. 

The
following control deficiencies constitute material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting: 

Insufficient
 resources resulting in inadequate segregation of duties in certain accounting functions, the processing and approval of transactions,
 due to the size of the accounting department. 

Lack
 of knowledge of US GAAP and ineffective controls associated with the conversion from IFRS to US GAAP 

Ineffective
 controls over inputs used in the valuation of the Asset Retirement Obligation 

Ineffective
 controls over the depletion calculation and the preparation of the oil and gas reserve report 

Ineffective
 controls on the accounting and the valuation of complex financial instruments 

Ineffective
 review of the financial statements due to the limited financial and reporting resources 

Ineffective
 information technology general controls in the areas of user access and program change-management over certain information technology
 systems that support the Company s financial reporting processes. 

Changes
in internal controls 

There
were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the nine months ended June 30, 2024 that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 

Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how
well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.
In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management
is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

Event of Default) the Collateral Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties, and each of its designees or agents, as attorney-in-fact of
such Obligor, irrevocably and with power of substitution, with authority to take any or all of the following actions upon the occurrence
and during the continuation of an Event of Default: 

(i)
to demand, collect, settle, compromise, adjust and give discharges and releases concerning the Collateral of such Obligor, all as the
Collateral Agent may reasonably determine in respect of such Collateral; 

(ii)
to commence and prosecute any actions at any court for the purposes of collecting any Collateral and enforcing any other right in respect
thereof; 

(iii)
to defend, settle, adjust or compromise any action, suit or proceeding brought with respect to the Collateral and, in connection therewith,
give such discharge or release as the Collateral Agent may deem reasonably appropriate; 

(iv)
to endorse checks, notes, drafts, acceptances, money orders, bills of lading, warehouse receipts or other instruments or documents evidencing
payment, shipment or storage of the goods giving rise to the Collateral of such Obligor, or securing or relating to such Collateral,
on behalf of and in the name of such Obligor; 

(v)
to sell, assign, transfer, make any agreement in respect of, or otherwise deal with or exercise rights in respect of, any Collateral
or the goods or services which have given rise thereto, as fully and completely as though the Collateral Agent were the absolute owner
thereof for all purposes; 

(vi)
to adjust and settle claims under any insurance policy relating to the Collateral; 

16 

(vii)
to execute and deliver and/or file all assignments, conveyances, statements, financing statements, continuation financing statements,
security agreements, affidavits, notices and other agreements, instruments and documents that the Collateral Agent may determine necessary
in order to perfect and maintain the security interests and Liens granted in this Security Agreement and in order to fully consummate
all of the transactions contemplated herein; 

(viii)
to institute any foreclosure proceedings that the Collateral Agent may deem appropriate; 

(ix)
to execute any document or instrument, and to take any action, necessary under applicable law (including the Federal Assignment of Claims
Act) in order for the Collateral Agent to exercise its rights and remedies (or to be able to exercise its rights and remedies at some
future date) with respect to any Account of an Obligor where the account debtor is a Governmental Authority; and 

(x)
to do and perform all such other acts and things as the Collateral Agent may reasonably deem to be necessary, proper or convenient in
connection with the Collateral. 

This
power of attorney is a power coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable for so long as any of the Obligations (other than contingent
indemnification obligations to the extent no claim giving rise thereto has been asserted) remain outstanding or any Transaction Document
is in effect. The Collateral Agent shall be under no duty to exercise or withhold the exercise of any of the rights, powers, privileges
and options expressly or implicitly granted to the Collateral Agent in this Security Agreement, and shall not be liable for any failure
to do so or any delay in doing so except if failure to do so or delay in doing so results from gross negligence, willful misconduct or
bad faith. The Collateral Agent shall not be liable for any act or omission or for any error of judgment or any mistake of fact in its
individual capacity or its capacity as attorney-in-fact except acts or omissions resulting from its gross negligence or willful misconduct.
This power of attorney is conferred on the Collateral Agent solely to perfect, protect, preserve and realize upon its security interest
in the Collateral. 

(b)
 Assignment by the Collateral Agent . The Collateral Agent may from time to time assign the Obligations or any portion thereof and/or
the Collateral or any portion thereof to a successor Collateral Agent in accordance with the terms of the Debentures, and the assignee
shall be entitled to all of the rights and remedies of the Collateral Agent under this Security Agreement in relation thereto. 

(c)
 The Collateral Agent s Duty of Care . Other than the exercise of reasonable care to assure the safe custody of the Collateral
while being held by the Collateral Agent hereunder, the Collateral Agent shall have no duty or liability to preserve rights pertaining
thereto, it being understood and agreed that the Obligors shall be responsible for preservation of all rights in the Collateral, and
the Collateral Agent shall be relieved of all responsibility for the Collateral upon surrendering it or tendering the surrender of it
to the Obligors. The Collateral Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the Collateral
in its possession if the Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which the Collateral Agent accords its own property,
which shall be no less than the treatment employed by a reasonable and prudent agent in the industry, it being understood that the Collateral
Agent shall not have responsibility for taking any necessary steps to preserve rights against any parties with respect to any of the
Collateral. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties agree not to create a security interest for the
benefit of its creditors in any Collateral in its possession or control. In the event of a public or private sale of Collateral pursuant
to Section 10 hereof, the Collateral Agent shall have no obligation to clean-up, repair or otherwise prepare the Collateral for sale. 

17 

12.
 Application of Proceeds . After the exercise of remedies by the Collateral Agent pursuant to the Debentures (or after the extensions
of credit (with accrued interest thereon) and all other amounts under the Transaction Documents shall automatically become due and payable
in accordance with the terms of such Section), any proceeds of the Collateral, when received by the Collateral Agent or any of the Secured
Parties in cash or its equivalent, will be applied in reduction of the Obligations in the order set forth in the Debentures, and each
Obligor irrevocably waives the right to direct the application of such payments and proceeds and acknowledges and agrees that the Collateral
Agent shall have the continuing and exclusive right to apply and reapply any and all such proceeds in the Collateral Agent s sole
discretion, notwithstanding any entry to the contrary upon any of its books and records. 

13.
[ Reserved] . 

14.
 Continuing Agreement . 

(a)
This Security Agreement shall be a continuing agreement in every respect and shall remain in full force and effect so long as any of
the Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations to the extent no claim giving rise thereto has been asserted) remain
outstanding or any Transaction Document is in effect. Upon such payment and termination, this Security Agreement shall be automatically
terminated and all of the Liens and security interests granted hereunder shall be automatically released and the Collateral Agent and
the Secured Parties shall, upon the request and at the expense of the Obligors, forthwith execute and/or deliver all UCC termination
statements and/or other documents reasonably requested by the Obligors evidencing such termination and release. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
all indemnities provided hereunder or under the Debenture shall survive termination of this Security Agreement. 

(b)
Any of the Collateral sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of by any Obligor to a Person in a transaction permitted by the Debenture,
shall be transferred free of the security interest created hereby on such Collateral, and such security interest shall automatically
terminate upon such permitted disposition. The Collateral Agent, at the request and sole expense of such Obligor, shall execute and deliver
to such Obligor all releases or other documents reasonably requested by such Obligor to evidence such release of the Liens created hereby
on such Collateral. 

18 

(c)
This Security Agreement shall continue to be effective or be automatically reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, in
whole or in part, of any of the Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Collateral Agent or any Secured
Party as a preference, fraudulent conveyance or otherwise under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, all as though such payment
had not been made; provided that in the event that payment of all or any part of the Obligations is rescinded or must be restored
or returned, all reasonable costs and expenses (including without limitation any reasonable legal fees and disbursements) incurred by
the Collateral Agent or any Secured Party in defending and enforcing such reinstatement shall be deemed to be included as a part of the
Obligations. 

15.
 Amendments; Waivers; Modifications . None of the terms or provisions of this Secured Agreement may be waived, amended, supplemented
or otherwise modified except in writing by the Borrower and the Collateral Agent; provided , however, that schedules to this Security
Agreement may be supplemented in each case duly executed by each Obligor directly affected thereby. 

16.
 Successors in Interest . This Security Agreement shall create a continuing security interest in the Collateral and shall be binding
upon each Obligor, its successors and assigns and shall inure, together with the rights and remedies of the Collateral Agent and the
Secured Parties hereunder, to the benefit of the Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties and their successors and permitted assigns;
 provided , however , that no party hereto may assign its rights or delegate its duties hereunder except as permitted by the
Debentures. 

17.
 Notices . All notices required or permitted to be given under this Security Agreement shall be in conformance with Section 8.2
of the Debenture. 

18.
 Counterparts . This Security Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which where so executed and delivered
shall be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. It shall not be necessary in making proof of this
Security Agreement to produce or account for more than one such counterpart. Delivery of executed counterparts of the Security Agreement
by telecopy or other electronic means shall be effective as an original and shall constitute a representation that an original shall
be delivered upon the request of the Collateral Agent. 

19.
 Headings . The headings of the sections and subsections hereof are provided for convenience only and shall not in any way affect
the meaning, construction or interpretation of any provision of this Security Agreement. 

20.
 Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial; Electronic Execution . THIS SECURITY AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND
OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW
YORK. The terms of Sections 8.11, 8.12 and 8.15 of the Debentures are incorporated herein by reference, mutatis mutandis , and
the parties hereto agree to such terms. 

19 

21.
 Severability . If any provision of this Security Agreement is determined to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, such provision
shall be fully severable and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect and shall be construed without giving effect
to the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions. 

22.
 Entirety . This Security Agreement and the other Transaction Documents represent the entire agreement of the parties hereto and
thereto, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, if any, including any commitment letters or correspondence
relating to this Security Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated herein and therein. 

23.
 Survival . All representations and warranties of the Obligors hereunder shall survive the execution and delivery of this Security
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. 

24.
 Joint and Several Obligations of Obligors . 

(a)
Each of the Obligors is accepting joint and several liability hereunder in consideration of the financial accommodations to be provided
by the Debentureholders under the Debentures, for the mutual benefit, directly and indirectly, of each of the Obligors and in consideration
of the undertakings of each of the Obligors to accept joint and several liability for the obligations of each of them. 

(b)
Each of the Obligors jointly and severally hereby irrevocably and unconditionally accepts, not merely as a surety but also as a co-debtor,
joint and several liability with the other Obligors with respect to the payment and performance of all of the Obligations, it being the
intention of the parties hereto that all the Obligations shall be the joint and several obligations of each of the Obligors without preferences
or distinction among them. 

(c)
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein, in any other of the Transaction Documents, to the extent the obligations
of a Guarantor shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason (including, without limitation, because of any applicable
state or federal law relating to fraudulent conveyances or transfers) then the obligations of such Obligor hereunder shall be limited
to the maximum amount that is permissible under applicable law (whether federal or state and including, without limitation, the Bankruptcy
Code).
