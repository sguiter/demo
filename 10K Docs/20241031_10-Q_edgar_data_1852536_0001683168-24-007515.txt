as of August 31, 2024, and as of February 29, 2024. The Company has yet established an ongoing source of revenue
sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. These factors among others raise substantial doubt
about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. 

In order to continue as a going concern, the Company
will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management s plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining
capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking third party equity
and/or debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurance that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its
plans. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 

Effective May 16, 2024, Gagi Gogolashvili,
the previous sole officer and director and majority shareholder of Intorio, Corp. (the Company ), entered into a stock purchase
agreements for the sale of 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company, representing approximately 89 of the issued and outstanding
shares of Common Stock of the Company as of such date, to six (6) accredited investors, and as such they are able to unilaterally control
the election of our board of directors, all matters upon which shareholder approval is required and, ultimately, the direction of our
Company. 

Upon the resignation of Mr. Gogolashvili
from all executive officer positions with the Company, including Chief Executive Officer and President, and as a member of the Board,
effective May 16, 2024, Dr. Han-Wen Ou was appointed as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and sole Director. 

Han-Wen Ou - Chief Executive Officer
and Director 

Dr. Ou has received the following
degrees: a Bachelor of Science (BSc) from Taipei Medical University, a Master of Functional Medicine (MSc) from University of Western
State (UWS), and a Doctor of Clinical Nutrition (PhD, DCN) from Maryland University of Integrative Health (MUIH). 

Dr. Ou was formerly a Resident
at Taipei Veterans General Hospital (TVGH), and an Attending Physician of Family Medicine at Taipei City Hospital. He is currently Director
of The American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine (A4M) of Taiwan, China, and Singapore, Director of Chinese Functional Medicine Association
(CFMA), Director of REDOX Integrative Functional Medicine Center and Director of REDOX Biomedicine CO., LTD. 

We have been introducing following Functional Medicine Laboratory
Testing Items since operate: 

Interpretation of Human Physiological Code: 

This system aims to prevent the
risk of metabolic diseases. In addition to blood fat and blood glucose tests, it also provides subtype analysis of low-density lipoproteins,
glycation end products, as well as the nutrients that affecting endothelial function, inflammatory factors and methylation metabolism
tests. In addition, by using urine to analyze organic acids produced during biochemical reactions in the body can help to examine whether
the metabolic function of cells using nutrients to produce energy is perfect. It can also be used to assess the risk of personal vitamin
and mineral deficiency. 

Using the most sophisticated molecular
testing equipment available today to examine various hormone concentrations and understand the balance among each other in the body. Providing
blood tests for male and female hormones, adrenal cortex hormones, and urine test results of estrogen and estrogen metabolism as a basis
for physicians to evaluate the endocrine function of their patients and then monitor therapeutic effect with salivary hormone testing.
A comprehensive endocrine function testing can achieve the most ideal and safest anti-aging and health care. 

13 

Nutrition is the foundation of
health care. Fully understand the nutritional status of patient can design an appropriate personalized conditioning program. To examine
the complete nutritional status of customers, REDOX Functional Medicine Laboratory uses a comprehensive molecular testing facility that
provides a variety of in vivo nutrient analysis data, including those of oxidative stress, antioxidant enzyme and cell membrane fatty
acid to assess potential disease risks. For assessing dietary nutrition, testing includes anti-oxidant vitamin analysis, amino acid balance
analysis, blood fatty acid analysis and mineral trace element analysis. 

This is used to assess the extent
to which environmental toxins threaten the health of individuals. Using hair/blood heavy metal toxin concentration tests to analyze the
risk of long-term exposure and contamination in daily life environment. By measuring urinary heavy metal concentrations and plasticizers
metabolite concentrations to evaluate the accumulation of various exogenous toxins in the body and environmental hormone residues, reminding
customers to stay away from possible sources of pollution and help strengthen the body s ability to detoxify, improve self-protection
to restore health. 

Changes in the body s physiological
response to daily factors such as diet, drugs, additives, personal items, environmental substances, etc., are useful indicators for examining
whether the individual s immune system is stable and balanced. Blood tests can be used to understand whether there is a health problem
with immune imbalance in the immune response of various specific and non-specific allergens, so as to avoid and prevent it early. Tests
Include acute allergen lgE testing, chronic food-lgG analysis, gluten and histamine tolerance analysis, and rheumatoid arthritis index
testing. 

This is used to assess the complete
functional status of gastrointestinal tract, from digestion and absorption to the integrity functional analysis of immune barrier. Through
stool analysis of personal food digestion capacity, intestinal absorption efficiency, microbial flora ecology, as well as detection of
intestinal infections, celiac disease / gluten allergy and inflammation, helping physicians on clinical diagnosis for effective treatment.
The function of intestinal wall barrier is analyzed using urine/stool samples, it can be immediately away from the threat of intestinal
leakage syndrome. It also provides breath detection to analyze the growth of intestinal microbes to avoid the deterioration of SIBO that
will affect health. 

Genetic analysis helps to understand
the innate physical characteristics of individual. Adjusting the individual s lifestyle and diet according to physical characteristics
can effectively strengthen health and prevent disease threats. Whether it is cardiovascular disease factor, lipid metabolism gene, macular
degeneration gene, methylation metabolic genotype or various cancer risk genetic analyses, further health management is planned through
relevant risk information after a complete physical type analysis, achieving more active and effective in reducing the risk of various
genetic diseases.

EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS 

At present, we have no employees
other than our officer and director. We presently do not have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing or similar
benefit plans; however, we May adopt such plans in the future. There are presently no personal benefits available to any officers, directors
or employees. 

Results o f Operation 

Our financial statements have been
prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability
and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. 

We expect we will require additional
capital to meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity
or debt securities. 

Three Months Ended August 31, 2024 and 2023: 

During the three months ended August 31, 2024, we have generated
 0 revenue. 

Our net loss for the three months ended August 31, 2024 was
 12,944. Operating expenses consist of mainly professional fees, consulting expenses and depreciation expenses. 

During three months ended August 31, 2023, we have generated
 750 revenue from consulting services. 

The net loss for the quarter ended August 31, 2024 and August
31, 2023 was 12,944 and 3,576, accordingly. Operating expenses consist of mainly professional fees, consulting expenses and depreciation
expenses. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of August 31, 2024, our total assets were 0. As of August
31, 2024, our current liabilities were 12,944. 

Cash Flows f rom Operating Activities 

We have not generated positive cash flows from operating
activities. For three months ended August 31, 2024, net cash flows used in operating activities was 14,862. For three months ended August
31, 2023, net cash flows used in operating activities was 13,453. 

Cash Flows f rom Investing Activities 

We did not generate any cash flows from investing activities
for the three -month period ended August 31, 2024 and 2023. 

Cash Flows f rom Financing Activities 

We have generated cash flows from financing activities for
the six month period ended August 31, 2024 in the amount of 2,580 from related parties. We have generated cash flows from financing activities
for six months ending August 31, 2023 in the amount of 8,970 from director loan. 

15 

Plan o f Operation and Fundin g 

We expect that working capital
requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital
requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business. 

Existing working capital, further
advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next three months.
We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of
the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases
in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of inventory; (ii) developmental expenses associated with
a start-up business; and (iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt
issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements.
Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities
might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing May not be available upon acceptable terms,
or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we May not be able to take advantage of prospective
new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. We will have to raise
additional funds in the next twelve months in order to sustain and expand our operations. We currently do not have a specific plan of
how we will obtain such funding; however, we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale
of our common stock. We have and will continue to seek to obtain short-term loans from our directors, although no future arrangement for
additional loans has been made. We do not have any agreements with our directors concerning these loans. We do not have any arrangements
in place for any future equity financing. 

O f f-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of the date of this Quarterly
Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources that are material to investors. 

Going Concern 

The financial statements have been prepared assuming
that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments
in the ordinary course of business. 

ITEM 3. Q UANTITATIVE AND Q UALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

No report required. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Our management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management,
including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

An evaluation was conducted under
the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls
and procedures as of August 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Such officer also confirmed
that there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting since Inception on January 4, 2021 ended August 31, 2024 that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
