 of the public shares if the Company has not consummated an initial Business Combination within the Combination Period or (B) with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could become subject to the claims of the Company s creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of the public shareholders. The Company will provide its public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of the initial Business Combination either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the initial Business Combination or (ii) without a shareholder vote by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of a proposed initial Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require the Company to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements. The shareholders will be entitled to redeem their shares at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations and on conditions described in the Company s IPO Prospectus. The amount in the Trust Account is per public share as of September 30, 2024. Ordinary shares subject to redemption are recorded at redemption value and classified as temporary equity following the completion of the IPO, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board s FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 ). On June 15, 2023, the Company received a written notice from the Listing Qualifications Department (the Staff of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC NASDAQ indicating that since the Company s aggregate market value of its outstanding warrants was less than 1,000,000, the Company was no longer in compliance with the Nasdaq Global Market continued listing criteria set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5452(b)(C) (the Rule ), which requires the Company to maintain an aggregate market value of its outstanding warrants of at least 1,000,000 (the Notice ). The Company has been given 45 calendar days from the date of the Notice to submit a plan to regain compliance with the Rule. The Company did not submit such plan. On August 16, 2023, the Staff notified the Company that NASDAQ determined to commence proceedings to delist the Company s Public Warrants, each whole warrant exercisable to purchase Class A ordinary share at a price of per share, and listed to trade on NASDAQ under the symbol LATGW , from NASDAQ and that trading in the Public Warrants would be suspended at the opening of business on August 25, 2023, due to the Company s failure to maintain a minimum of 1,000,000 in aggregate market value of its outstanding warrants for continued listing under NASDAQ Listing Rule 5452(b)(C). The Company did not appeal the Staff s delisting determination. As a result, a Form 25-NSE was filed by NASDAQ on September 8, 2023 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC to remove the Company s Public Warrants from listing and registration on NASDAQ. Trading in the Company s Class A ordinary shares and Units continues on NASDAQ. If the Company has not consummated the Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (less taxes payable and up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining shareholders and the Company s board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject, in each case, to the Company s obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law. The Sponsor and each member of the management team have agreed to (i) waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of the initial Business Combination; (ii) waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to the Company s MAA (A) to modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to allow redemption in connection with the initial Business Combination or to redeem of the public shares if the Company has not consummated an initial Business Combination within the

 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, the Company has not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have the Company independently verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and the Company believes that the Sponsor s only assets are securities of the Company. Therefore, the Company cannot provide assurance that the Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the Trust Account, the funds available for the initial Business Combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than per public share. In such event, the Company may not be able to complete the initial Business Combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of the Company s officers or directors will indemnify the Company for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.

In the case that additional Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities are issued or deemed issued in connection with the initial Business Combination, the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all founder shares will equal, in the aggregate, of the total number of Class A ordinary shares outstanding after such conversion (after giving effect to any redemptions of Class A ordinary shares by public shareholders), including the total number of Class A ordinary shares issued, or deemed issued or issuable upon conversion or exercise of any equity-linked securities or rights issued or deemed issued, by the Company in connection with or in relation to the consummation of the initial Business Combination, excluding any Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities exercisable for or convertible into Class A ordinary shares issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the initial Business Combination and any Private Placement Warrants issued to the Sponsor, officers or directors upon conversion of Working Capital Loans; provided that such conversion of founder shares will never occur on a less than one-for-one basis. On April 13, 2023, at the First Extraordinary General Meeting, the shareholders approved, among others, the proposal to amend the Company s MAA to provide for the right of a holder of the Company s Class B ordinary shares to convert into Class A ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis prior to the closing of a Business Combination at the election of the holder. On November 8, 2023, the New Sponsor notified the Company that it elected to convert Class B ordinary shares held by itself to the same number of Class A ordinary shares, pursuant to the Founder Share Amendment Proposal. On November 16, 2023, Class B ordinary shares held by the New Sponsor were converted into the same number of Class A ordinary shares. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were Class A ordinary shares shares are subject to possible redemption) and Class B ordinary shares of the Company, issued and outstanding.

The warrant liabilities were measured at fair value at inception and remeasured on a recurring basis, with changes in fair value presented within change in fair value of warrant liabilities in the statements of operations. The overallotment option was accounted for as a liability in accordance with ASC 815-40 and was presented within liabilities on the balance sheets from January 27, 2022 up to its expiration on March 10, 2022. The overallotment liability was measured at fair value at inception. The expiration of the overallotment resulted in a gain of which is presented within gain on expiration of overallotment option in the statements of operations. The Company used a Binomial Option Pricing Model to value the Private Placement Warrants and a Black-Scholes model to value the overallotment option at the initial measurement date. The Company allocated the proceeds received from (i) the sale of Units (which is inclusive of share of Class A ordinary shares and one -half of one Public Warrant), first to the warrants and overallotment option based on their fair values as determined at initial measurement, with the remaining proceeds allocated to Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption (temporary equity) based on their fair values at the initial measurement date. The Public Warrants, the Private Placement Warrants and overallotment option were classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy at the initial measurement dates due to the use of unobservable inputs. Inherent in pricing models are assumptions related to expected share-price volatility, expected life and risk-free interest rate. The Company estimates the volatility of its ordinary shares based on historical volatility that matches the expected remaining life of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants. The expected life of the warrants is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company used the quoted price on Over-the-Counter Market (the OTC to establish the fair value of the Public Warrants.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. References in this quarterly report to we, us, Company or our company are to Chenghe Acquisition I Co. (formerly LatAmGrowth SPAC), a Cayman Islands exempted company. References to management or our management team are to our officers and directors. Capitalized but not otherwise defined terms have the meaning as ascribed to such terms in the notes to the accompanying financial statements. Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This quarterly report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act that are not historical facts and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected and projected. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this quarterly report, including, without limitation, statements under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations regarding our financial position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. When used in this quarterly report, words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend, seek and similar expressions, are intended to, identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward- looking statements as a result of certain factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are qualified in their entirety by this paragraph. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this quarterly report. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Overview We, Chenghe Acquisition I Co. (f/k/a LatAmGrowth SPAC) are a blank check company incorporated on May 20, 2021 as a Cayman Islands exempted company and incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. On October 25, 2023, our shareholders approved to change our name to Chenghe Acquisition I Co., as a result of the Sponsor Sale. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our IPO and the private placement of the private placement warrants and forward purchase units, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination (pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. The issuance of additional shares in connection with a business combination to the owners of the target or other investors: may significantly dilute the equity interest of investors in our IPO, which dilution would increase if the anti-dilution provisions in the Class B ordinary shares resulted in the issuance of Class A ordinary shares on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion of the Class B ordinary shares; may subordinate the rights of holders of Class A ordinary shares if preference shares are issued with rights senior to those afforded our Class A ordinary shares; could cause a change in control if a substantial number of our Class A ordinary shares are issued, which could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the share ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of us; and may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Class A ordinary shares.

 Similarly, if we issue debt securities or otherwise incur significant debt to bank or other lenders or the owners of a target, it could result in: default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations; acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant; our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand; our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding; our inability to pay dividends on our Class A ordinary shares; using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our Class A ordinary shares, expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate; increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; and limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt. 
 As indicated in the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements, at September 30, 2024, we had no cash and had working capital deficit of 4,471,356. Transaction costs related to our IPO amounted to 7,647,620 consisting of 2,600,000 of underwriting discount, 4,550,000 of deferred underwriting discount, and 497,620 of other offering costs. In addition, 2,494,203 of cash was held outside of the trust account and was available for working capital purposes at the consummation of the IPO. Further, we expect to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our initial business combination. We cannot assure you that our plans to raise capital or to complete our initial business combination will be successful. Proposed Business Combination with Femco Steel Technology Co., Ltd. As discussed in more details in Note 1 Organization and Business Operation to the unaudited condensed financial statements contained elsewhere in this report, on December 22, 2023, the Company entered into the Business Combination Agreement with the FST Parties, pursuant to which, among other transactions, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company with the Company being the surviving company and as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of CayCo, and the Company will change its name to FST Ltd. . Under the Business Combination Agreement, FST agreed to bear all of the fees and costs relating to the extension of the Company s Termination Date not exceeding 80,000 per month. The Extension Contributions loaned to the Company will be forgiven if the Company is unable to consummate a business combination except to the extent of any funds held outside of the trust account. If the Business Combination Agreement is terminated by FST due to the Company s shareholders failure to approve the FST Business Combination or the Company s material breach of its obligations as described in the Business Combination Agreement, the Company shall pay and reimburse FST the Extension Contribution(s) FST has deposited in the trust account with funds held outside of the trust account. Under the Business Combination Agreement, the obligations of the parties (or, in some cases, some of the parties) to consummate the FST Business Combination are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary closing conditions of the respective parties, including, among others, (i) the accuracy of representations and warranties to various standards, from no material qualifier to a material adverse effect qualifier, (ii) material compliance with pre-closing covenants, (iii) no material adverse effect for FST, (iv) FST s Company

The Business Combination Agreement contemplates the execution of various additional agreements and instruments, on or before the closing of the FST Business Combination, including, among others, Sponsor Support Agreement, Company Shareholder Support Agreement, Lock-up Agreement and Investor Rights Agreement. On September 10, 2024, the Company and FST Parties entered into the First Amendment to Business Combination Agreement (the First BCA Amendment ), pursuant to which, the date, by which if the closing of the Business Combination has not occurred the Business Combination Agreement will be terminated, is extended from 5:00 p.m. (Hong Kong time) on October 26, 2024 to 5:00 p.m. (Hong Kong time) on January 26, 2025 (or such later time mutually agreed upon by the Company and Chenghe) (the Agreement End Date ). All other terms of the Business Combination Agreement, which was previously filed by Chenghe as Exhibit 2.1 to Chenghe s Current Report on Form 8-K on December 22, 2023, remain unchanged. Results of Operations As of September 30, 2024, we have not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from May 20, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2024, relates to our formation and IPO, and, since the completion of our IPO, the Sponsor Sale, searching for a target to consummate an initial business combination and activities in connection with the proposed FST Business Combination. We will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial business combination, at the earliest. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from our IPO and placed in the trust account. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 224,112, which consisted of trust interest income of 486,747 and an unrealized gain on change in fair value of warrants of 288,000, offset by formation and operating costs of 550,635. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 408,688, which consisted of formation and operating costs of 1,565,985 and an unrealized loss on change in fair value of warrants of 288,000, offset by trust interest income of 1,445,297. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net income of 1,014,277, which consisted of other income attributable to the reduction of deferred underwriting fee allocated to offering costs of 186,550, unrealized gain on change in fair value of warrants of 416,950 and trust interest income of 778,829, partially offset by formation and operating costs of 368,052.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 1,094,434. Net loss of 408,688 was affected by interest earned on marketable investments held in the Trust Account of 1,445,297 and an unrealized loss on change in fair value of warrants of 288,000. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided 471,551 of cash for operating activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in operating activities was 438,469. Net income of 3,961,115 was affected by unrealized gain on change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 1,726,560, other income attributable to the reduction of deferred underwriting fee allocated to offering costs of 186,550, and interest earned on marketable investments held in the Trust Account of 3,069,235.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by financing activities was 1,882,809 which includes proceeds from the issuance of promissory note to related party of 1,094,434 and extension deposits paid by target of 788,375. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in financing activities was 77,171,024. This included proceeds from the Sponsor promissory note of 300,000 and cash withdrawn from the Trust Account for the partial redemption of ordinary shares of 77,471,024. Liquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern As of September 30, 2024, we had no cash on hand and working capital deficit of 4,471,356. On October 6, 2023, we transferred cash balance of 428,000 from our bank account controlled by the Old Sponsor to an account controlled by the New Sponsor, due to our new bank account under the control of the New Sponsor has not been set up yet. We and the New Sponsor agreed to offset the balance of 428,000 due from the New Sponsor with the outstanding promissory note balance due to the New Sponsor of 1,925,479 as of September 30, 2024, as a result of which, the total outstanding balance of the promissory note was 1,497,479 as of September 30, 2024 (see Note 5 to the unaudited condensed financial statements contained elsewhere in this report). On January 27, 2022, we consummated our IPO of 13,000,000 units, at 10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of 130.0 million. Simultaneously with the closing of our IPO, we consummated the sale of 7,900,000 private placement warrants at a price of 1.00 per private placement warrant in a private placement to our sponsor, generating gross proceeds of 7.9 million. Prior to the completion of the IPO, we lacked the liquidity we needed to sustain operations for a reasonable period of time, which is considered to be one year from the issuance date of the financial statements. At the IPO date, cash of 2,494,203 in excess of the funds deposited in the trust account and/or used to fund offering expenses was released to us for general working capital purposes. We did not have any cash on hand as of September 30, 2024. Until consummation of our initial business combination, we will use the funds raised from the New Sponsor, as mentioned below, for paying existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective initial business combination candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to merge with or acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the business combination. We can raise additional capital through working capital loans from the sponsor, an affiliate of the sponsor, certain of our officers and directors, or through loans from third parties. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of our business plan, and reducing overhead expenses. We cannot provide assurance that new financing will be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. On April 13, 2023, at the First Extraordinary General Meeting, in connection with the approval of the First Extension Amendment Proposal, we have agreed to contribute into the trust account the lesser of an aggregate of 150,000 and 0.0375 per share for each public share that was not redeemed at the First Extraordinary General Meeting for each monthly period commencing April 27, 2023, until the earlier of the completion of the initial business combination and November 27, 2023. We issued the April 2023 Note, a non-interest bearing non-convertible unsecured promissory note, to the Old Sponsor for a principal amount of up to 1,050,000 to fund the contributions to the trust account in connection with the First Extension Amendment and First Trust Amendment. The April 2023 Note was terminated on October 4, 2023 and the withdrawal of 300,000 under the April 2023 Note was forgiven without any further liability of us or the Old Sponsor. The amounts forgiven were booked as a capital transaction at October 4, 2023. On October 25, 2023, at the Second Extraordinary General Meeting, in connection with the approval of the Second Extension Amendment Proposal, we have agreed to contribute into the trust account the lesser of 80,000 and 0.02 for each public share that was not redeemed at the Second Extraordinary General Meeting for each monthly period commencing October 27, 2023 until the earlier of the completion of the initial business combination and October 27, 2024. On October 25, 2023, we issued the October 2023 Note, a non-interest bearing non-convertible unsecured promissory note, to the New Sponsor for a principal amount of up to 1,960,000. As of September 30, 2024, the total outstanding under the October 2023 Note was 1,497,479. Including the 428,000 cash transferred from our bank account controlled by the Old Sponsor to the account controlled by the New Sponsor (as mentioned above), the New Sponsor paid 1,925,479 in total under the October 2023 Note, on behalf of us, for extension and working capital purposes, of which 610,000 was used for extension deposits and 1,315,479 was used for working capital purposes. On July 11, 2024, the Company issued the July 2024 Note, a non-interest bearing non-convertible unsecured promissory note, to the New Sponsor, for a principal amount of up to 500,000. The Company may apply the amount advanced by the New Sponsor under the

Table of Contents 
 July 2024 Note to fund the Extension Contribution or, as the Company deems appropriate, towards general corporate purposes. The unpaid principal amount under the July 2024 Note will be repayable by the Company to the New Sponsor on the effective date of an initial merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination involving the Company and one or more businesses. The maturity date of the July 2024 Note may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in the July 2024 Note). As of September 30, 2024, the total outstanding under the July 2024 Note was nil. On January 3, 2024, 76,512.38 was deposited as Extension Contribution into the trust account by FST pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, extending the Termination Date to January 27, 2024. From February 2024 to September 2024, nine tranches of 78,837, for an aggregated of 709,537, were deposited as Extension Contribution into the Trust Account by FST pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, extending the Termination Date to October 27, 2024. On October 25, 2024, at the Third Extraordinary General Meeting, in connection with the approval of the Third Extension Amendment Proposal, in addition to the Extension Contributions, the Company commits to deposit extra incentive in the Trust Account for the Third Extension. As a result, in the aggregate, the Company commits to pay (a) 0.03 for each of the Company s Class A ordinary shares not elected to be redeemed immediately after the Third Extraordinary General Meeting for each one-month extension period from October 27, 2024 (exclusive) to January 27, 2025; and (b) 0.05 for each of the Company s Class A ordinary shares not elected to be redeemed immediately after the Third Extraordinary General Meeting for each one-month extension period from January 25, 2025 to April 27, 2025. On November 4, 2024, 80,000 was deposited as Extension Contribution into the Trust Amount by FST pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, and on November 5, 2024, 26,032.93 was deposited as Extension Contribution into the Trust Account by the Company, extending the Termination Date to November 27, 2024. If a business combination is not consummated by the required date and we are unable to obtain the funding to further extend the Termination Date, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution. In connection with our assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board s Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, we have until November 27, 2024 (or April 27, 2025 subject to additional extension deposits as approved in the Third Extraordinary General Meeting) to consummate the initial Business Combination. We intend to complete the initial Business Combination before the mandatory liquidation date. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to consummate any business combination by November 27, 2024 (or April 27, 2025 subject to additional extension deposits as approved in the Third Extraordinary General Meeting). Management has determined that the mandatory liquidation, should a business combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution, raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. Risks and Uncertainties Management is currently evaluating the impact of the Israel-Hamas conflict and the Russia-Ukraine war and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the war could have a negative effect on the Company s financial position, results of its operations and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these unaudited condensed financial statements. The unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. Contractual Obligations As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not have any long-term debt, capital or operating lease obligations.

 Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of condensed financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. A critical accounting estimate to our condensed financial statements is the estimated fair value of our warrant liabilities and over-allotment liability, and Class B ordinary shares. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for sale of an asset or paid for transfer of a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. GAAP establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable. Warrant Liabilities and Over-allotment Liability We do not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. We evaluate all of our financial instruments, including issued stock purchase warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives, pursuant to ASC 815-15. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity and measurement of fair value is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. In accordance with ASC 825-10 Financial Instruments , offering costs attributable to the issuance of the derivative warrant liabilities and overallotment option have been allocated based on their relative fair value of total proceeds and are recognized in the statements of operations as incurred. Derivative warrant liabilities are classified as non-current liabilities as their liquidation is not reasonably expected to require the use of current assets or the creation of current liabilities. We account for warrants and over-allotment as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant and over-allotment option s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ). The assessment considers whether the warrants and over-allotment option are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants and over-allotment option meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants and over-allotment option are indexed to our own ordinary shares, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment is conducted at the time of warrant and over-allotment option issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants and over-allotment option are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants and over-allotment option that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants and over-allotment option are recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants and over-allotment option that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants and over-allotment option are required to be recorded as a liability at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants and over-allotment option are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. We accounted for the warrants and over-allotment option in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815-40. The warrants and over-allotment are not considered indexed to our own ordinary shares, and as such, they do not meet the criteria for equity treatment and are recorded as liabilities. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company used the quoted price on Over - the - Counter Market (the OTC to establish the fair value of the Public Warrants.

Table of Contents 
 The Private Placement Warrants changed from Level 2 at September 30, 2023 to Level 3 at December 31, 2023 as a result of the lack of an observable market quote of the Public Warrants on that day. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 a Monte Carlo simulation methodology was used in estimating the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants. Class B Ordinary Shares (or Founder Shares The Company analyzed the SPA entered into during September 2023 under SAB Topic 5, Miscellaneous Accounting, section T, Accounting for Expenses or Liabilities Paid by Principal Stockholder(s) and concluded that the SPA provides the Company with a benefit in the form of the right to receive additional extension contributions from the New Sponsor. The right to receive the additional extension contributions required the New Sponsor, who is a principal shareholder, to provide or cause to provide consideration in the form of a transfer of Class B ordinary shares of the Company. The estimated fair value of the earnout provision at the closing of the Sponsor Sale on October 6, 2023 is nominal to zero. As a result, the Company determined that an expense in the full amount of the fair value of the Class B ordinary shares transferred should be recorded. During October 2023, the Company recorded an expense under SAB Topic 5T of 2,851,750 with a corresponding increase to additional paid-in capital, based on a Monte Carlo Model simulation valuation of the Class B ordinary shares. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09), which requires disclosure of incremental income tax information within the rate reconciliation and expanded disclosures of income taxes paid, among other disclosure requirements. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company s management does not believe the adoption of ASU 2023-09 will have a material impact on its unaudited condensed financial statements and disclosures. Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company s unaudited condensed financial statements. JOBS Act The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We qualify as an emerging growth company and under the JOBS Act are allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. Additionally, we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an emerging growth company, we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an independent registered public accounting firm s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the report of the independent registered public accounting firm providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our IPO or until we are no longer an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Following the consummation of our IPO, the net proceeds of our IPO, including amounts in the trust account, have been invested in U.S. government treasury bills, notes or bonds with a maturity of 185 days or less or in certain money market funds that invest solely in US treasuries. Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe there will be no associated material exposure to interest rate risk.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer (together, the Certifying Officers ), or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Certifying Officers, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024, due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in the SEC guidelines for public companies. The material weaknesses identified relate to ineffective controls over recording of accounting transactions in the proper period, controls over accounting for and disclosure of complex financial instruments in the proper period, including those requiring them to apply complex accounting principles as a means of differentiating between liability, temporary equity and permanent equity classification, controls over fair value estimation of complex financial instruments such as Class B ordinary shares, earnout provision, and forfeiture provision, and controls over timely reconciliation of accrued legal expenses and NASDAQ filing fees. In light of these material weaknesses, we have enhanced our processes to identify and appropriately apply applicable accounting requirements to better evaluate and understand the nuances of the complex accounting standards that apply to our financial statements including making greater use of third-party professionals with whom we consult regarding complex accounting applications. The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time, and we can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. We believe our efforts will enhance our controls relating to accounting for and disclosure of complex financial instruments in the proper period, but we can offer no assurance that our controls will not require additional review and modification in the future as industry accounting practice may evolve over time. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting This quarterly report does not include a management s assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting or an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the SEC for newly public companies and for an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
