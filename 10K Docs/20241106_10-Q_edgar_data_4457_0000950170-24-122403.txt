The Voting Common Stock and Non-Voting Common Stock are allocated and , respectively, of our undistributed earnings available to common stockholders. This represents earnings available to common stockholders less the dividends declared for both the Voting Common Stock and Non-Voting Common Stock. Our undistributed earnings per share is calculated by taking the undistributed earnings available to common stockholders and dividing this number by the weighted average shares outstanding for the respective stock. If there was a dividend declared for that period, the dividend per share is added to the undistributed earnings per share to calculate the basic and diluted earnings per share. The process is used for both Voting Common Stock and Non-Voting Common Stock.

Gross proceeds from matured or redeemed securities were million and million for the first six months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Included in the September 30, 2024 and 2023 proceeds were million and million from the Moving and Storage Treasuries that matured. The gross realized gains on these sales totaled million and million during the first six months of fiscal 2025 and 2024 , respectively. The gross realized losses on these sales totaled million and million during the first six months of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. For available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we first assess whether the security is below investment grade. For securities that are below investment grade, we evaluate whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors such as the interest rate environment. Declines in value due to credit are recognized as an allowance. In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse market conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, cumulative default rates based on ratings are used to determine the potential cost of default, by year. The present value of these potential costs is then compared to the amortized cost of the security to determine the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Declines in fair value that have not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses, such as declines due to changes in market interest rates, are recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. If we intend to sell a security, or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the security is written down to its fair value and the write down is charged against the allowance for credit losses, with any incremental impairment reported in earnings. Reversals of the allowance for credit losses are permitted and should not exceed the allowance amount initially recognized. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. There was a million and million net impairment charge recorded in the first six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities as borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

(Gains) or losses recognized in income on interest rate derivatives are recorded as interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. During the first six months of fiscal 2025 and 2024 , we recognized a (decrease)/increase in the fair value of our cash flow hedges of 0 million and million, respectively, net of taxes. During the first six months of fiscal 2025 and 2024 , we reclassified 8 million and 1 million, respectively, from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) AOCI to interest expense, net of tax. As of September 30, 2024 , we expect to reclassify million of net gains on interest rate contracts from AOCI to earnings as interest expense over the next 12 months. Economic Hedges We use derivatives to economically hedge our equity market exposure to indexed annuity products sold by our Life Insurance company. These contracts earn a return for the contract holder based on the change in the value of the S P 500 index between annual index point dates. We buy and sell listed equity and index call options and call option spreads. The credit risk is with the party in which the options are written. The net option price is paid up front and there are no additional cash requirements or additional contingent liabilities. These contracts are held at fair value on our balance sheet. These derivative instruments are included in Investments, other on the consolidated balance sheets. The fair values of these call options are determined based on quoted market prices from the relevant exchange and are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Net gains recognized in net investment and interest income for the first six months of September 30, 2024 and 2023 were million and 4 million, respectively.

Although the call options are employed to be effective hedges against our policyholder obligations from an economic standpoint, they do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting under GAAP. Accordingly, the changes in fair value of the call options are recognized each reporting date as a component of net investment and interest income. The change in fair value of the call options include the gains or losses recognized at the expiration of the option term and the changes in fair value for open contracts.

U-Haul management fee revenue from Mercury 

U-Haul management fee revenue from Mercury 

We currently manage the self-storage properties owned or leased by Blackwater and Mercury Partners, L.P. Mercury ), pursuant to a standard form of management agreement, under which we receive a management fee of between and of the gross receipts plus reimbursement for certain expenses. We received management fees, exclusive of reimbursed expenses, of million and million from the above-mentioned entities during the first six months of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. This management fee is consistent with the fee received for other properties we previously managed for third parties. Mark V. Shoen controls the general partner of Mercury. The limited partner interests of Mercury are owned indirectly by James P. Shoen and various trusts benefiting Edward J. Shoen and James P. Shoen or their descendants. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, Mercury exercised its option to purchase 78 U-Haul branded self-storage locations from W.P. Carey. The self-storage component of these properties was previously leased by Mercury from W.P. Carey and managed by U-Haul, while the non-self-storage portions of these properties were leased by U-Haul. Post acquisition, Mercury now owns all of these properties and U-Haul acts as property manager. There were several changes recognized in the first six months of fiscal 2025 and will continue to be going forward as a result of this transaction. Retail sales revenues along with the associated cost of goods sold previously recognized by U-Haul will now be with Mercury. U-Move and U-Box related revenue will remain unchanged; however, Mercury will earn standard commissions for the transactions at these locations. Management fees earned by U-Haul will increase as a result of the increased revenues attributable to Mercury and certain operating expenses at these locations that were formerly the responsibility of U-Haul will now be reimbursed by Mercury. The net effect of all of these changes is not expected to result in a material change to operating earnings over the course of the fiscal year. Related Party Costs and Expenses

We estimate the fair value for financial instruments not carried at fair value using the same methods and assumptions as those we carry at fair value. The financial instruments presented below are reported at carrying value on the consolidated balance sheets. Cash equivalents were million and million as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. Fair values of cash equivalents approximate carrying value due to the short period of time to maturity. Fair values of mortgage loans and notes on real estate are based on quoted market prices, dealer quotes or discounted cash flows. Fair values of trade receivables approximate their recorded value. Our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of temporary cash investments, trade receivables, and notes receivable. Limited credit risk exists on trade receivables due to the diversity of our customer base and their dispersion across broad geographic markets. We place our temporary cash investments with financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution. We have mortgage loans, which potentially expose us to credit risk. The portfolio of loans is principally collateralized by self-storage facilities and commercial properties. We have not experienced any material losses related to the loans from individual or groups of loans in any particular industry or geographic area. The estimated fair values were determined using the discounted cash flow method and using interest rates currently offered for similar loans to borrowers with similar credit ratings. Other investments are substantially current or bear reasonable interest rates. As a result, the carrying values of these financial instruments approximate fair value. The following represents our financial instruments not carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets and corresponding placement in the fair value hierarchy.

 million and million for the second quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Deferred income primarily relates to payments received from customers prior to satisfaction of our performance obligations. Of the amounts recorded as unearned revenue as of March 31, 2024 , million and million, respectively, was recognized as revenue for the second quarter and six months ended September 30, 2024. Revenue Recognized in Accordance with Topic 842 The Company s self-moving rental revenues meet the definition of a lease pursuant to the guidance in ASC Topic 842, Leases because those substitution rights do not provide an economic benefit to the Company that would exceed the cost of exercising the right. Please see Note 9, Leases, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Self-moving equipment rentals are recognized over the contract period that trucks and moving equipment are rented. We offer two types of self-moving rental contracts, one-way rentals and in-town rentals, which have varying payment terms. Customer payment is received at the initiation of the contract for one-way rentals, which covers an allowable limit for equipment usage. An estimated fee in the form of a deposit is received at the initiation of the contract for in-town rentals, and final payment is received upon the return of the equipment based on actual fees incurred. Self-moving rental contracts span a relatively short period of time, and the majority of these contracts began and ended within the same fiscal year. Self-storage revenues are recognized as earned over the contract period based upon the number of paid storage contract days. We lease portions of our operating properties to tenants under agreements that are classified as operating leases. We recognize the total minimum lease payments provided for under the leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Generally, under the terms of our leases, the majority of our rental expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, are recovered from our customers.

The amounts above do not reflect future rental revenue from the renewal or replacement of existing leases. Revenue Recognized in Accordance with Other Topics Traditional life and Medicare supplement insurance premiums are recognized as revenue over the premium-paying periods of the contracts when due from the policyholders. For products where premiums are due over a significantly shorter duration than the period over which benefits are provided, such as our single premium whole life product, premiums are recognized when received and excess profits are deferred and recognized in relation to the insurance in-force. Property and casualty insurance premiums are recognized as revenue over the policy periods. Interest and investment income are recognized as earned. Net investment and interest income has multiple components. Interest income from bonds and mortgage notes are recognized when earned. Dividends on common and preferred stocks are recognized on the ex-dividend dates. Realized gains and losses on the sale or exchange of investments are recognized at the trade date. In the following tables, revenue is disaggregated by timing of revenue recognition:

In the above table, the revenues recognized over time include property management fees, the shipping fees associated with U-Box container rentals and a portion of other revenues. Revenues recognized at a point in time include self-moving and self-storage products and service sales and a portion of other revenues. We recognized liabilities resulting from contracts with customers for self-moving equipment rentals, self-storage revenues, U-Box revenues and tenant revenues, in which the length of the contract goes beyond the reported period end, although rental periods of the equipment, storage and U-Box contract are generally short-term in nature. The timing of revenue recognition results in liabilities that are reflected in deferred income on the balance sheet. primary components of trade receivables, receivables from corporate customers and credit card receivables from customer sales and rental of equipment. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and assesses each customer s credit worthiness. In addition, the Company monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains an allowance based upon applying an expected credit loss rate to receivables based on the historical loss rate from similar high-risk customers adjusted for current conditions, including any specific customer collection issues identified, and forecasts of economic conditions. Delinquent account balances are written off after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is remote. We believe that the historical loss information it has compiled is a reasonable base on which to determine expected credit losses for trade receivables because the composition of trade receivables as of that date is consistent with that used in developing the historical credit loss percentages (i.e., the similar risk characteristics of its customers and its lending practices have not changed signi cantly over time). To adjust the historical loss rates to re ect the e ects of these di erences in current conditions and forecasted changes, management assigns a rating to each customer which varies depending on the assessment of risk. Management estimated the loss rate at approximately as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. Management developed this estimate based on its knowledge of past experience for which there were similar improvements in the economy. As a result, management applied the applicable credit loss rates to determine the expected credit loss estimate for each aging category. Accordingly, the allowance for expected credit losses as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024 was million and million, respectively.

 million and million as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively, and are excluded from the estimate of credit losses. We have elected not to measure an allowance on accrued interest receivables as our practice is to write off the uncollectible balance that is 90 days or more past due. Furthermore, we have elected to write off accrued interest receivables by reversing interest income. Mortgage Loans, Net Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future, or until maturity or payoff, are reported at amortized cost. Modeling for the Company s mortgage loans is based on inputs most highly correlated to defaults, including loan-to-value, occupancy, and payment history. These loans are evaluated on an individual basis and loan specific risk characteristics such as occupancy levels, expense, income growth and other relevant available information from internal and external sources relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. When management determines that credit losses are expected to occur, an allowance for expected credit losses based on the fair value of the collateral is recorded. There were no delinquent commercial mortgage loans as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the Company had no commercial mortgage loans in non-accrual status. The Company had no unfunded commitment balance to commercial loan borrowers as of September 30, 2024. Reinsurance Recoverables Reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid benefits was less than of the total assets as of September 30, 2024, which is immaterial based on historical loss experience and high credit rating of the reinsurers. Premium Receivables Premium receivables were million and 1 million as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively, in which the credit loss allowance is immaterial based on our ability to cancel the policy if the policyholder does not pay premiums.

Certain countries have enacted legislation to adopt the Pillar Two framework while several countries are considering or still announcing changes to their tax laws to implement the minimum tax directive. While we do not currently estimate Pillar Two to have a material impact on our effective tax rate, our analysis will continue as the OECD continues to release additional guidance and countries implement legislation.

Item 2. Management s Discus sion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 General 
 We begin Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A with U-Haul Holding Company's overall strategy, followed by a description of, and strategy related to, our operating segments to give the reader an overview of the goals of our businesses and the direction in which our businesses and products are moving. We then discuss our critical accounting estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. Next, we discuss our results of operations for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025, compared with the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024, which is followed by an analysis of liquidity changes in our balance sheets and cash flows, and a discussion of our financial commitments in the sections entitled "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Summary" and "Use of Cash". We conclude this MD A by discussing our current outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2025. 
 This MD A should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ("Quarterly Report"), including the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The various sections of this MD A contain a number of forward-looking statements, as discussed under the caption, Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risks described throughout this filing or in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. Many of these risks and uncertainties are beyond our control and our actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements. 
 U-Haul Holding Company, a Nevada corporation, has a second fiscal quarter that ends on the 30 th of September for each year that is referenced. Our insurance company subsidiaries have a second quarter that ends on the 30 th of June for each year that is referenced. They have been consolidated on that basis. Our insurance companies financial reporting processes conform to calendar year reporting as required by state insurance departments. Management believes that consolidating their calendar year into our fiscal year financial statements does not materially affect the presentation of financial position or results of operations. We disclose material events, if any, occurring during the intervening period. Consequently, all references to our insurance subsidiaries years 2024 and 2023 correspond to fiscal 2025 and 2024 for U-Haul Holding Company. 
 Overall Strategy 
 Our overall strategy is to maintain our leadership position in the North American do-it-yourself moving and storage industry. We accomplish this by providing a seamless and integrated supply chain to the do-it-yourself moving and storage market. As part of executing this strategy, we leverage the brand recognition of U-Haul with our full line of moving and self-storage related products and services and the convenience of our broad geographic presence. 
 Our primary focus is to provide our customers with a wide selection of moving rental equipment, convenient self-storage rental facilities, portable moving and storage units and related moving and self-storage products and services. We are able to expand our distribution and improve customer service by increasing the amount of moving equipment and storage units and portable moving and storage units available for rent, expanding the number of independent dealers and company operated locations in our network and taking advantage of our Storage Affiliate and Moving Help capabilities. 
 Property and Casualty Insurance is focused on providing and administering property and casualty insurance to U-Haul and its customers, its independent dealers and affiliates. 
 Life Insurance is focused on long term capital growth through direct writing and reinsuring of life insurance, Medicare supplement and annuity products in the senior marketplace.

 Cybersecurity Incident 
 On September 9, 2022, we announced that the Company was made aware of a data security incident involving U-Haul's information technology network. U-Haul detected a compromise of two unique passwords used to access U-Haul customers' information. U-Haul took immediate steps to contain the 
 42 

incident and promptly enhanced its security measures to prevent any further unauthorized access. U-Haul retained cybersecurity experts and incident response counsel to investigate the incident and implement additional security safeguards. The investigation determined that between November 5, 2021 and April 8, 2022, the threat actor accessed customer contracts containing customers names, dates of birth, and driver s license or state identification numbers. None of U-Haul s financial, payment processing or email systems were involved. U-Haul has notified impacted customers and relevant governmental authorities. 
 Several class action lawsuits related to the incident were filed against U-Haul, which were consolidated into one action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona (the "Court"). On October 27, 2023, the Court dismissed with prejudice all claims except those brought under the California Consumer Privacy Act. The parties settled all remaining claims for 5.1 million pursuant to an agreement approved by order of the Court on October 25, 2024. All 5.1 million is covered by insurance and has been paid by the insurer into trust for disbursement in accordance with the terms of the settlement.

Self-moving equipment rental revenues increased 17.9 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Transactions were flat compared to the second quarter of last year while revenue per transaction increased for both our In-Town and one-way markets. Compared to the same period last year, we increased the number of Company-operated retail locations, and independent dealers, as well as the number of box trucks in the rental fleet. 
 Self-storage revenues increased 15.6 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The average monthly number of occupied units increased by 5.5 , or 31,933 units, during the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared with the same period last year. The growth in revenues and square feet rented comes from a combination of occupancy gains, the addition of new capacity to the portfolio and a 1.6 improvement in average revenue per occupied foot. During the quarter, we added approximately 0.9 million new net rentable square feet. 
 Sales of self-moving and self-storage products and services decreased 3.8 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2024. This was due to a decline in reported sales of hitches and moving supplies. Approximately 4.8 million of the decrease was related to the exercise of an option by Mercury Partners, L.P. ("Mercury") in February 2024 to purchase 78 U-Haul 
 43 

branded self-storage locations from W.P. Carey resulting in locations formerly leased by U-Haul now being treated as managed properties. From an operational standpoint, our customers will not recognize any changes to the services they receive from these locations. Please see Note 11. Related Party Transactions for additional information related to this transaction and its effect. Excluding the effects of this ownership change, moving supplies and hitch sales from U-Haul owned and operated locations increased. 
 Life insurance premiums decreased 2.0 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2024 due primarily to decreased life and Medicare supplement premiums. 
 Property and casualty insurance premiums increased 0.2 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 Net investment and interest income decreased 26.9 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Changes in the market value of common stock investments held at our Property and Casualty Insurance subsidiary accounted for 5.0 million of the decrease and was offset by realized gains on the sale of common stock of 4.1 million. Our Life Insurance subsidiaries investment income increased 2.5 million primarily from gains on derivatives used as hedges to fixed indexed annuities. The Moving and Storage segment interest income has been classified as Other interest income in fiscal 2025 and accounts for 28.5 million of the decrease. 
 Other revenue increased 6.9 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2024, caused primarily by increases in our U-Box program. We continue to expand our breadth and reach of this program through additional warehouse space, moving and storage containers and delivery equipment. 
 Listed below are revenues and earnings from operations at each of our operating segments for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The insurance companies two quarters ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.

Total costs and expenses increased 128.6 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Operating expenses for Moving and Storage increased 55.2 million. Repair expenses associated with the rental fleet experienced a 5.4 million decrease during the quarter while we experienced increases in personnel, liability costs, property taxes and building maintenance.

 44 

Depreciation expense associated with our rental fleet increased 36.0 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2024 due to the higher cost of new additions to the fleet combined with expected decreases in resale values for certain units currently in the fleet.

Depreciation expense on all other assets, largely from buildings and improvements, increased 7.9 million. Net losses on the disposal or retirement of land and buildings increased 1.3 million.

Over the last 12 months we added approximately 6.1 million net rentable square feet of new storage to the system. This was a mix of approximately 1.1 million square feet of existing storage locations we acquired and 5.0 million square feet of new development.

 Property and Casualty Insurance 
 Quarter Ended June 30, 2024 compared with the Quarter Ended June 30, 2023 
 Premiums were 26.5 million and 26.4 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A significant portion of Repwest s premiums relate to policies sold in conjunction with U-Haul rental transactions. The premium written corresponded with the change in moving and storage transactions at U-Haul during the same period. 
 Net investment and interest income was 4.9 million and 5.5 million for the quarters ended June 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The main driver of the change in net investment income was a net decrease in the valuation on unaffiliated common stock. 
 Operating expenses were 11.9 million and 12.1 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change was primarily due to an increase in adjusting income. 
 Benefits and losses incurred were 5.7 million and 4.2 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was due to growth in the number of policies issued combined with adverse loss experience. 
 As a result of the changes in revenues and expenses described above, pretax earnings from operations were 13.8 million and 15.4 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Life Insurance 
 Quarter Ended June 30, 2024 compared with the Quarter Ended June 30, 2023 
 Premiums were 20.5 million and 22.5 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Medicare Supplement premiums decreased 1.3 million from the policy decrements offset by premium rate increases. Life premiums decreased 1.0 million primarily from the decrease in sales of single premium life and final expense. Both decreases were due to policyholder lapses currently outweighing sales levels. Deferred annuity deposits were 150.2 million or 68.8 million above prior year and are accounted for on the balance sheet as deposits rather than premiums. 
 Net investment income was 34.1 million and 31.6 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Realized losses on derivatives used as hedges to fixed indexed annuities were 2.0 million. Net interest income and realized gain on the invested assets increased 5.7 million, primarily bonds. 
 Operating expenses were 5.3 million and 4.7 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily due to the increase in administrative expenses related to the adjudication of claims for an aging final expense block. 
 Benefits and losses incurred were 38.7 million and 38.3 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest credited to policyholders was primarily responsible for the increase. 
 Amortization of deferred acquisition costs DAC ), sales inducement asset ("SIA") and the value of business acquired ("VOBA") was 4.4 million and 6.8 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in DAC amortization was primarily due to a lower amount of mortgage prepayment penalty gains, for which we offset gains with a corresponding level of amortization. 
 As a result of the changes in revenues and expenses described above, pretax earnings from operations were 7.6 million and 5.5 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Repair costs associated with the rental fleet experienced a 26.2 million decrease during the first six months of fiscal 2025 while we experienced increases in personnel, property taxes, utilities and building maintenance.

We increased the number of retired trucks sold compared to the same period last year. Depreciation expense on all other assets, largely from buildings and improvements, increased 16.4 million. Net losses on the disposal or retirement of land and buildings increased 3.4 million. Additional details are available in the following Moving and Storage section.

 Interest expense for the first six months of fiscal 2025 was 138.7 million, compared with 124.5 million for the first six months of fiscal 2024, due to an increase in our average cost of debt. Other interest income at Moving and Storage increased 34.4 million due to the new presentation this year compared to last year. It is related to net investment and interest income as presented last year in Moving and Storage; comparing these two lines it showed a decrease of 21.2 million due to reduced invested cash balances compared to the to the first six months of fiscal 2024.

Self-moving equipment rental revenues increased 32.7 million during the first six months of fiscal 2025, compared with the first six months of fiscal 2024. Transactions and average revenue per transaction both increased. Compared to the same period last year, we increased the number of Company-operated retail locations, and independent dealers, as well as the number of box trucks in the rental fleet. 
 Self-storage revenues increased 32.4 million during the first six months of fiscal 2025, compared with the first six months of fiscal 2024. The average monthly number of occupied units increased by 5.6 , or 31,758 units, during the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared with the same period last year. The growth in revenues and square feet rented comes from a combination of occupancy gains, the addition of new capacity to the portfolio and a 2.1 improvement in average revenue per occupied foot. During the first six months, we added approximately 2.6 million of new net rentable square feet. 
 We own and manage self-storage facilities. Self-storage revenues reported in the consolidated financial statements represent Company-owned locations only. Self-storage data for our owned storage locations follows:

Over the last twelve months we added approximately 6.1 million net rentable square feet of new storage to the system. This was a mix of approximately 1.1 million square feet of existing storage locations we acquired and 5.0 million square feet of new development. 
 Sales of self-moving and self-storage products and services decreased 8.1 million for the first six months of fiscal 2025, compared with the first six months of fiscal 2024. This was due to a decline in reported sales of hitches and moving supplies. Approximately 10.1 million of the decrease was related to the exercise of an option by Mercury in February 2024 to purchase 78 U-Haul branded self-storage 
 51 

locations from W.P. Carey resulting in locations formerly leased by U-Haul now being treated as managed properties. From an operational standpoint, our customers will not recognize any changes to the services they receive from these locations. Please see Note 11. Related Party Transactions for additional information related to this transaction and its effect. 
 Other revenue increased 15.8 million during the first six months of fiscal 2025, compared with the first six months of fiscal 2024, caused primarily by increases in our U-Box program. We continue to expand our breadth and reach of this program through additional warehouse space, moving and storage containers and delivery equipment. 
 Total costs and expenses increased 230.4 million during the first six months of fiscal 2025, compared with the six months of fiscal 2024. Operating expenses increased 76.7 million. Repair costs associated with the rental fleet experienced a 26.2 million decrease during the first six months of fiscal 2025 while we experienced increases in personnel, property taxes, utilities and building maintenance. Approximately 16.5 million of the increase was due to non-recurring costs associated with our transition to a new box supplier. 
 Depreciation expense associated with our rental fleet increased 58.3 million for the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared with the first six months of fiscal 2024 due to an increase in the pace of new additions to the fleet combined with their higher cost. Net gains from the disposal of rental equipment decreased 77.1 million as resale values have decreased while the average cost of units being sold has increased. We increased the number of retired trucks sold compared to the same quarter last year. Depreciation expense on all other assets, largely from buildings and improvements, increased 16.4 million. Net losses on the disposal or retirement of land and buildings increased 3.4 million.

Property and Casualty Insurance 
 Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 compared with the Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 
 Premiums were 48.5 million and 47.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A significant portion of Repwest s premiums relate to policies sold in conjunction with U-Haul rental transactions. The premium written corresponded with the change in moving and storage transactions at U-Haul during the same period. 
 Net investment and interest income was 11.1 million and 12.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The main driver of the change in net investment income was a net decrease in the valuation on unaffiliated common stock. 
 Operating expenses were 23.5 million and 23.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Benefits and losses incurred were 10.6 million and 8.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was due to growth in the number of policies issued combined with adverse loss experience in non-U-Haul related policies. 
 As a result of the above-mentioned changes in revenues and expenses, pretax earnings from operations were 25.3 million and 27.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Life Insurance 
 Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 compared with the Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 
 Premiums were 41.2 million and 45.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Medicare Supplement premiums decreased 2.4 million due to the advanced age of the block. Life premiums decreased 2.0 million primarily from the decrease in sales of single premium life and final expense. Deferred annuity deposits were 211.7 million or 86.6 million above prior year and are accounted for on the balance sheet as deposits rather than premiums. 
 Net investment income was 65.9 million and 63.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Realized gains on derivatives used as hedges to fixed indexed annuities decreased 1.8 million. The change in the provision for expected credit losses resulted in a 2.2 million decrease. Net interest income and realized gains on the invested assets increased 5.4 million. 
 Operating expenses were 15.4 million and 10.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was due to the salary and wages expenses, consulting fees, receivable write down and audit fees. 
 Benefits and losses incurred were 77.8 million and 79.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest credited to policyholders was primarily responsible for the increase. 
 Amortization of DAC, SIA and VOBA were 9.1 million and 14.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease was due to the fluctuations of the ASU 2018-12 amortization method. 
 As a result of the above-mentioned changes in revenues and expenses, pretax earnings from operations were 7.4 million and 6.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We believe our current capital structure is a positive factor that will enable us to pursue our operational plans and goals and provide us with sufficient liquidity. There are many factors that could affect our liquidity, 
 53 

including some which are beyond our control, and there is no assurance that future cash flows and liquidity resources will be sufficient to meet our outstanding debt obligations and our other future capital needs. 
 As of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled 1,435.6 million, compared with 1,534.5 million as of March 31, 2024. The assets of our insurance subsidiaries are generally unavailable to fulfill the obligations of non-insurance operations (Moving and Storage). As of September 30, 2024 (or as otherwise indicated), cash and cash equivalents, other financial assets (receivables, other investments, fixed maturities, equity securities, and related party assets) and debt obligations of each operating segment were:

As of September 30, 2024, Moving and Storage had additional cash available under existing credit facilities of 495.0 million. The majority of invested cash in the Moving and Storage segment is held in government money market funds. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased 46.8 million in the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared with the first six months of fiscal 2024 due to the timing of the settlement of credit cards. 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased 511.5 million in the first six months of fiscal 2025, compared with the first six months of fiscal 2024. Purchases of property, plant and equipment increased 262.6 million. Fleet related spending increased 181.7 million while investment spending on real estate and development increased 101.4 million. Cash from the sales of property, plant and equipment decreased 43.5 million largely due to fleet sales. For our insurance subsidiaries, net cash used in investing activities increased 145.4 million due to an increase in purchases and decreased proceeds on sales in fixed maturity investments and net cash provided by investing activities for Moving and Storage decreased 54.7 million on short-term Treasury notes. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities increased 276.9 million in the first six months of fiscal 2025, as compared with the first six months of fiscal 2024. This was due to a combination of increased debt payments of 91.5 million, decreased finance lease repayments of 20.5 million, an increase in cash from borrowings of 267.5 million, an increase in dividend payments of 3.5 million and an increase in net annuity deposits from Life Insurance of 83.9 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources and Requirements of Our Operating Segments 
 Moving and Storage 
 To meet the needs of our customers, U-Haul maintains a large fleet of rental equipment. Capital expenditures have primarily consisted of new rental equipment acquisitions and the buyouts of existing fleet from leases. The capital to fund these expenditures has historically been obtained internally from operations and the sale of used equipment and externally from debt and lease financing. U-Haul estimates that during fiscal 2025, the Company will reinvest in its rental equipment fleet approximately 1,115 million, net of equipment sales and excluding any lease buyouts. Through the first six months of fiscal 2025, the Company invested, net of sales, approximately 795.0 million before any lease buyouts in its rental equipment fleet. Fleet investments in fiscal 2025 and beyond will be dependent upon several factors including the availability of capital, the truck rental environment, the availability of equipment from our original equipment manufacturers and the used-truck sales market. We anticipate that the fiscal 2025 investments will be funded largely through debt financing, external lease financing and cash from operations. Management considers several factors including cost and tax consequences when selecting a method to fund capital expenditures. Our allocation between debt and lease financing can change from year to year based upon financial market conditions which may alter the cost or availability of financing options. 
 The Company has traditionally funded the acquisition of self-storage properties to support U-Haul's growth through debt financing and funds from operations. The Company s plan for the expansion of owned storage properties includes the acquisition of existing self-storage locations from third parties, the acquisition and development of bare land, and the acquisition and redevelopment of existing buildings not currently used for self-storage. For the first six months of fiscal 2025, the Company invested 734.3 million in real estate acquisitions, new construction and renovation and repair. For fiscal 2025, the timing of new projects will be dependent upon several factors, including the entitlement process, availability of capital, weather, and the identification and successful acquisition of target properties and the availability of labor and materials. We are likely to maintain a high level of real estate capital expenditures in fiscal 2025. U-Haul's growth plan in self-storage also includes the expansion of the U-Haul Storage Affiliate program, which does not require significant capital. 
 Net capital expenditures (purchases of property, plant and equipment less proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment and lease proceeds) at Moving and Storage were 1,562.2 million and 1,256.1 million for the first six months of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. The components of our net capital expenditures are provided in the following table:

Moving and Storage continues to hold significant cash and we believe has access to additional liquidity. Management may invest these funds in our existing operations, expand our product lines or pursue external opportunities in the self-moving and storage marketplace, pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or reduce existing indebtedness where possible. 
 55 

Property and Casualty Insurance 
 State insurance regulations restrict the amount of dividends that can be paid to stockholders of insurance companies. As a result, Property and Casualty Insurance s assets are generally not available to satisfy the claims of U-Haul Holding Company or its legal subsidiaries. We believe that stockholders equity at Property and Casualty Insurance remains sufficient, and we do not believe that its ability to pay ordinary dividends to U-Haul Holding Company will be restricted per state regulations. 
 Property and Casualty Insurance s stockholder s equity was 368.0 million and 350.5 million as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase resulted from net earnings of 20.1 million and a decrease in other comprehensive income of 2.5 million due to the decrease in the market value of its investment portfolio. Property and Casualty Insurance does not use debt or equity issues to increase capital and therefore has no direct exposure to capital market conditions other than through its investment portfolio. 
 Life Insurance 
 Life Insurance manages its financial assets to meet policyholder and other obligations, including investment contract withdrawals and deposits. Life Insurance s net deposits as of June 30, 2024 were 42.2 million. State insurance regulations restrict the amount of dividends that can be paid to stockholders of insurance companies. As a result, Life Insurance s assets are generally not available to satisfy the claims of U-Haul Holding Company or its legal subsidiaries. 
 Life Insurance s stockholder s equity was 200.6 million and 197.7 million as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease resulted from net earnings of 5.9 million and a decrease in other comprehensive income of 3.1 million primarily due to the effect of interest rate changes on the fixed maturity portion of the investment portfolio. Outside of its membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB system, Life Insurance has not historically used debt or equity issues to increase capital and therefore has not had any significant direct exposure to capital market conditions other than through its investment portfolio. As of June 30, 2024, Oxford had outstanding deposits of 60.0 million in the FHLB, for which Oxford pays fixed interest rates between 0.55 and 4.52 with maturities between March 31, 2025 and April 30, 2029. As of June 30, 2024, available-for-sale-investments held with the FHLB totaled 82.9 million, of which 69.4 million were pledged as collateral to secure the outstanding advances. The balances of these advances are included within liabilities from investment contracts on the consolidated balance sheets. 
 Cash Flows by Operating Segments 
 Moving and Storage 
 Net cash provided from operating activities were 920.9 million and 887.3 million for the first six months of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, due to the timing of the settlement of credit cards. 
 Property and Casualty Insurance 
 Net cash provided by operating activities were 18.2 million and 18.1 million for the first six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Property and Casualty Insurance s cash and cash equivalents amounted to 78.3 million and 52.5 million as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These balances reflect funds in transition from maturity proceeds to long-term investments. Management believes this level of liquid assets, combined with budgeted cash flow, is adequate to meet our future operating cash needs. Capital and operating budgets allow Property and Casualty Insurance to schedule cash needs in accordance with investment and underwriting proceeds. 
 Life Insurance 
 Net cash provided by operating activities were 45.2 million and 32.1 million for the second quarters ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in operating cash flows was primarily due to timing of settlement of receivables for securities. This was offset by the decrease in premiums net of benefits and commissions. 
 56 

In addition to cash flows from operating activities and financing activities, a substantial amount of liquid funds are available through Life Insurance s short-term portfolio and its membership in the FHLB. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents amounted to 77.8 million and 101.9 million, respectively. Management believes that the overall sources of liquidity are adequate to meet our future operating cash needs. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources - Summary 
 We believe we have the financial resources needed to meet our business plans, including our working capital needs. We continue to hold significant cash and have access to existing credit facilities and additional liquidity to meet our anticipated capital expenditure requirements for investment in our rental fleet, rental equipment and storage acquisitions and build outs. 
 The Internal Revenue Service completed and finalized their examination for tax years March 2014 through March 2021. As a result, we are owed 129 million which is reflected in Prepaid expense. 
 Our borrowing strategy has primarily focused on asset-backed financing, rental equipment leases and private placement borrowings limited by the amount of unencumbered assets available. As part of this strategy, we seek to ladder maturities and fix interest rates. While each of these loans typically contains provisions governing the amount that can be borrowed in relation to specific assets, the overall structure is flexible with no limits on overall Company borrowings. Management believes it has adequate liquidity between cash and cash equivalents and unused borrowing capacity in existing credit facilities to meet the current and expected needs of the Company over the next several years. As of September 30, 2024, we had available borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities of 495.0 million. While it is possible that circumstances beyond our control could alter the ability of the financial institutions to lend us the unused lines of credit, we believe that there are additional opportunities for leverage in our existing capital structure. 
 Use of Cash 
 Our estimates as to future use of cash have not materially changed from the disclosure included under the subheading Use of Cash in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. 
 Fiscal 2025 Outlook 
 We will continue to focus our attention on increasing transaction volume and improving pricing, product and utilization for self-moving equipment rentals. Maintaining an adequate level of new investment in our truck fleet is an important component of our plan to meet our operational goals and is likely to increase in fiscal 2025. Revenue in the U-Move program could be adversely impacted should we fail to execute in any of these areas. Should we be unable to acquire enough new rental equipment to properly rotate our fleet, repair and maintenance costs will continue to increase. Even if we execute our plans, we could see declines in revenues primarily due to unforeseen events including adverse economic conditions or heightened competition that is beyond our control. 
 With respect to our storage business, we have added new locations and expanded existing locations. In fiscal 2025, we are actively looking to complete current projects, increase occupancy in our existing portfolio of locations and acquire new locations. New projects and acquisitions will be considered and pursued if they fit our long-term plans and meet our financial objectives. It is likely spending on acquisitions and new development will increase in fiscal 2025. We will continue to invest capital and resources in the U-Box program throughout fiscal 2025. 
 Inflationary pressures may challenge our ability to maintain or improve upon our operating margin. 
 Property and Casualty Insurance will continue to provide loss adjusting and claims handling for U-Haul and underwrite components of the Safemove , Safetow , Safemove Plus , Safestor and Safestor Mobile protection packages to U-Haul customers. 
 Life Insurance is pursuing its goal of expanding its presence in the senior market through the sales of its Medicare supplement, life and annuity policies. This strategy includes growing its agency force, expanding its new product offerings, and pursuing business acquisition opportunities.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. To mitigate these risks, we may utilize derivative financial instruments, among other strategies. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 The exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our variable rate debt obligations and one variable rate operating lease. We have used interest rate swap agreements and forward swaps to reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates. We enter into these arrangements with counterparties that are significant financial institutions with whom we generally have other financial arrangements. We are exposed to credit risk should these counterparties not be able to perform their obligations. Following is a summary of our interest rate swap agreements as of September 30, 2024:

1 Month SOFR 

As of September 30, 2024, we had 778.6 million of variable rate debt obligations, of this amount, 400.0 million is not fixed through interest rate swaps. If Secured Overnight Funding Rate SOFR were to increase 100 basis points, the increase in interest expense on the variable rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by 4.0 million annually (after consideration of the effect of the above derivative contracts). Certain senior mortgages have an anticipated repayment date and a maturity date. If these senior mortgages are not repaid by the anticipated repayment date the interest rate on these mortgages would increase from the current fixed rate. We are using the anticipated repayment date for our maturity schedule. 
 Additionally, our insurance subsidiaries fixed income investment portfolios expose us to interest rate risk. This interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of a fixed income security to changes in interest rates. As part of our insurance companies asset and liability management, actuaries estimate the cash flow patterns of our existing liabilities to determine their duration. These outcomes are compared to the characteristics of the assets that are currently supporting these liabilities assisting management in determining an asset allocation strategy for future investments that management believes will mitigate the overall effect of interest rates. 
 We use derivatives to hedge our equity market exposure to indexed annuity products sold by our Life Insurance company. These contracts earn a return for the contract holder based on the change in the value of the S P 500 index between annual index point dates. We buy and sell listed equity and index call options and call option spreads. The credit risk is with the party in which the options are written. The net option price is paid up front and there are no additional cash requirements or additional contingent liabilities. These contracts are held at fair market value on our balance sheet. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, these derivative hedges had a net market value of 8.2 million and 10.5 million, with notional amounts of 530.2 million and 526.4 million, respectively. These derivative instruments are included in Investments, other, on the consolidated balance sheets. 
 Although the call options are employed to be effective hedges against our policyholder obligations from an economic standpoint, they do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting under GAAP. Accordingly, the call options are marked to fair value on each reporting date with the change in fair value, plus or minus, included as a component of net investment and interest income. The change in fair value of the call options includes the gains or losses recognized at the expiration of the option term and the changes in fair value for open contracts. 
 70 

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 The exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our Canadian business. Approximately 5.4 and 5.3 of our revenue was generated in Canada during the first six months of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. The result of a 10 change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar would not be material to net income. We typically do not hedge any foreign currency risk since the exposure is not considered material.
