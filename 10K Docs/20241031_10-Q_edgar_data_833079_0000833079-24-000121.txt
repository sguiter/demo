 regions: West, Central and East, which are comprised of states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Utah, Texas, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. We also operate a financial services reporting segment. In this segment, we offer title and escrow, mortgage, and insurance services. Carefree Title Agency, Inc. ("Carefree Title"), our wholly-owned title company, provides title insurance and closing/settlement services to our homebuyers in certain states. Managing our own title operations allows us greater control over the entire escrow and closing cycles in addition to generating additional revenue. Meritage Homes Insurance Agency, Inc. Meritage Insurance ), our wholly-owned insurance broker, works in collaboration with insurance companies nationwide to offer homeowners insurance and other insurance products to our homebuyers. Our financial services operation also provides mortgage services to our homebuyers through an unconsolidated joint venture. 
 We commenced our homebuilding operations in 1985 through our predecessor company, Monterey Homes. Meritage Homes Corporation was incorporated in the state of Maryland in 1988 under the name of Emerald Mortgage Investments Corporation. We changed our name to Homeplex Mortgage Investments Corporation in 1990 and merged with Monterey Homes in 1996, at which time our name was changed to Monterey Homes Corporation and later ultimately to Meritage Homes Corporation. Since that time, we have engaged in homebuilding and related activities. Meritage Homes Corporation operates as a holding company and has no independent assets or operations. Its homebuilding construction, development and sales activities are conducted through its subsidiaries. Its homebuilding activities are conducted under the name of Meritage Homes in each of our homebuilding markets. At September 30, 2024, we were actively selling homes in communities, with base prices ranging from approximately to . 
 
 Amounts in transit from title companies or closing agents for home closings of approximately million and million are included in Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

, commencing with the acquisition of the land, continuing through the land development phase, if applicable, and concluding with the construction, sale and closing of the homes. Actual community lives will vary based on the size of the community, the sales orders absorption rates and whether the land purchased was raw, partially-developed or in finished status. Master-planned communities encompassing several phases and super-block land parcels may have significantly longer lives and projects involving smaller finished lot purchases may be significantly shorter. 
 All of our land inventory and related real estate assets are periodically reviewed for recoverability when certain criteria are met, but at least annually, as our inventory is considered long-lived in accordance with GAAP. Community-level reviews are performed quarterly to determine if indicators of potential impairment exist. If indicators of potential impairment exist and the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset are lower than its carrying amount, impairment charges are recorded to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The impairment of a community is allocated to each remaining unstarted lot in the community on a straight-line basis and is recognized in Cost of home closings in the period in which the impairment is determined. Our determination of fair value is based on projections and estimates. Changes in these expectations may lead to a change in the outcome of our impairment analysis, and actual results may also differ from our assumptions, although if financial metrics improve, we do not reverse impairments once recorded. See Note 2 for additional information related to real estate. 
 Our Deposits on real estate under option or contract were million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. See Note 3 for additional information related to Deposits on real estate under option or contract.

after the close of the home and a structural warranty that typically extends up to years after the close of the home. With the assistance of an actuary, we have estimated these reserves for the structural warranty based on the number of homes still under warranty and historical data and trends for our geographies. We may use industry data with respect to similar product types and geographic areas in markets where our experience is incomplete to draw a meaningful conclusion. We regularly review our warranty reserves and adjust them, as necessary, to reflect changes in trends as information becomes available. Based on such reviews of warranty costs incurred, we did not adjust the warranty reserve balance in the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. Included in the warranty reserve balances at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are case-specific reserves for warranty matters, as discussed in Note 15.

 Generally, our options to purchase lots remain effective so long as we purchase a pre-established minimum number of lots on a pre-determined schedule in accordance with each respective agreement. Although the pre-established number is typically structured to approximate our expected rate of home construction starts, during a weakened homebuilding market, we may purchase lots at an absorption level that exceeds our expected orders and home starts pace to meet the pre-established minimum number of lots or restructure our original contract to terms that more accurately reflect our revised orders pace expectations. During a strong homebuilding market, we may accelerate our pre-established minimum purchases if allowed by the contract.

 million unsecured revolving credit facility 
 Total 
 (1) . 
 The Company entered into an amended and restated unsecured revolving credit facility agreement ("Credit Facility") in 2014 that has been amended from time to time. In June 2024, the Credit Facility was amended to: increase the facility size; refresh the accordion feature permitting the facility size to be increased subject to certain conditions; extend the maturity date from June 2, 2028 to June 12, 2029; and revise the applicable pricing grid. The Credit Facility's aggregate commitment is 
 12 

million with an accordion feature permitting the size of the facility to increase to a maximum of billion, subject to certain conditions, including the availability of additional bank commitments. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at the Company's option, at either (1) term SOFR (based on 1, 3, or 6 month interest periods, as selected by the Company) plus a basis point adjustment plus an applicable margin (ranging from basis points to basis points (the "applicable margin")) based on the Company's leverage ratio as determined in accordance with a pricing grid, (2) the higher of (i) the prime lending rate ("Prime"), (ii) an overnight bank rate plus basis points and (iii) term SOFR (based on a 1 month interest period) plus a basis point adjustment plus , in each case plus a margin ranging from basis points to basis points based on the Company's leverage in accordance with a pricing grid, or (3) daily simple SOFR plus a basis point adjustment plus the applicable margin. At September 30, 2024, the interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility would have been per annum, calculated in accordance with option (1) noted above and using the 1-month term SOFR. We are obligated to pay a fee on the undrawn portion of the Credit Facility at a rate determined by a tiered fee matrix based on our leverage ratio. 
 The Credit Facility also contains certain financial covenants, including (a) a minimum tangible net worth requirement of billion (which amount is subject to increase over time based on subsequent earnings and proceeds from equity offerings), and (b) a maximum leverage covenant that prohibits the leverage ratio (as defined therein) from exceeding . We were in compliance with all Credit Facility covenants as of September 30, 2024. 
 We had outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. There were borrowings or repayments under the Credit Facility during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility totaling million, leaving million available under the Credit Facility to be drawn.

 The indentures for our 2027 Notes and 2029 Notes contain non-financial covenants including, among others, limitations on the amount of secured debt we may incur, and limitations on sale and leaseback transactions and mergers. We were in compliance with all such covenants as of September 30, 2024. 
 Obligations to pay principal and interest on the senior and convertible senior notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly-owned subsidiaries (each a Guarantor and, collectively, the Guarantor Subsidiaries ), each of which is directly or indirectly 100 owned by Meritage Homes Corporation. Such guarantees are full and unconditional, and joint and several. In the event of a sale or other disposition of all of the assets of any Guarantor, by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise, or a sale or other disposition of all of the equity interests of any Guarantor then held by Meritage and its subsidiaries, then that Guarantor may be released and relieved of any obligations under its note guarantee. There are no significant restrictions on our ability or the ability of any Guarantor to obtain funds from their respective subsidiaries, as applicable, by dividend or loan. We do not provide separate financial statements of the Guarantor Subsidiaries because Meritage (the parent company) has no independent assets or operations and the guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several. Subsidiaries of Meritage Homes Corporation that are non-guarantor subsidiaries are, individually and in the aggregate, minor. 
 In September 2023, we partially redeemed million of our 2025 Notes, incurring million in early debt extinguishment charges in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, reflected as Loss on early extinguishment of debt in the accompanying unaudited consolidated income statements. After the partial redemption, the 2025 Notes had million in remaining principal outstanding.

million aggregate principal amount of 2028 Convertible Notes (the "2028 Convertible Notes") pursuant to an Indenture dated as of May 9, 2024 (the Indenture ). The 2028 Convertible Notes were issued at par and will mature on May 15, 2028, unless converted earlier in accordance with their terms prior to such date. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to pay the cost of entering into the capped calls, as defined and described below, and to redeem the remaining million aggregate principal then outstanding of our 2025 Notes for which we incurred million in early debt extinguishment charges in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , reflected as Loss on early extinguishment of debt in the accompanying unaudited consolidated income statements. There were such charges in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 The 2028 Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of the Company s common stock at an initial conversion rate of 4.3048 shares of common stock per 1,000 principal amount of the 2028 Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events but will not be adjusted for accrued and unpaid interest or quarterly cash dividends. In addition, we must provide additional shares upon conversion if there is a "Make-Whole Fundamental Change". The Company is required to satisfy its conversion obligations by paying cash up to the principal amount of notes and settle any additional value in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at the Company s election. 
 
 Prior to February 15, 2028, the holders of the 2028 Convertible Notes may convert their notes only under the following conditions: (1) the sale price of common stock reaches of the applicable conversion price for a specified period during any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ending on September 30, 2024; (2) the trading price of the 2028 Convertible Notes falls below 98 of the product of the last reported sale price of common stock and the conversion rate for a specified period; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after February 15, 2028, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the Notes, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. 
 
 The 2028 Convertible Notes are accounted for in accordance with ASC 470, Debt , and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ("ASC 815") . The conversion options and the 2028 Convertible Notes are reflected as a single instrument in Senior and convertible senior notes, net on the accompanying unaudited consolidated balance sheets and the conversion options are not bifurcated as a derivative. 

Capped Call Transactions 
 
 Concurrent with the offering of the 2028 Convertible Notes, we used million of the net proceeds to enter into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the "Capped Calls which require the Capped Calls counterparties (the "Counterparties") to provide shares of our common stock to converting debt holders up to a cap price. The Capped Calls each have an initial strike price of approximately per share, subject to certain adjustments, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the 2028 Convertible Notes. The Capped Calls have initial cap prices of per share, subject to certain adjustments. The Capped Calls will reduce our obligation to settle, in shares or in cash, conversions when our stock price is between and . 
 
 The Capped Calls are separate transactions entered into by the Company with each of the Counterparties, are not part of the terms of the 2028 Convertible Notes and do not change the note holders rights under the 2028 Convertible Notes or the Indenture. Holders of the 2028 Convertible Notes do not have any rights with respect to the Capped Calls. 
 
 As the Capped Calls are considered indexed to the Company's own stock, they are recorded in stockholders equity as a reduction of Additional paid-in capital in the accompanying unaudited consolidated balance sheets, and are not accounted for as derivatives under ASC 815-10.

 Other financial assets and liabilities, including our Loans payable and other borrowings, are generally shorter term in nature and the longer term balances are not material to our consolidated balance sheets. Therefore, we consider the carrying amounts of our other financial assets and liabilities to approximate fair value. 
 Non-Financial Instruments: Our Real estate assets are Level 3 instruments that are required to be recorded at fair value only if events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. See Note 1 for additional information regarding the valuation of these assets.

NOTE 8 
 Effect of dilutive securities: Unvested restricted stock Diluted average shares outstanding Net earnings Basic earnings per share Diluted earnings per share 
 
 We compute basic earnings per share by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share gives effect to the potential dilution that could occur if securities or contracts to issue common stock that are dilutive were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in our earnings. In accordance with ASC 260-10, Earnings Per Share , we calculate the dilutive effect of the 2028 Convertible Notes using the "if-converted" method. As discussed in Note 6, the Company will settle any convertible note conversions by paying cash up to the principal amount of notes and settle any additional value in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at the Company s election. As the Company will settle the principal amount of convertible notes in cash upon conversion, the convertible notes only have a dilutive impact when the average share price of the Company s common stock exceeds the conversion price, in any applicable period. 

NOTE 9 
 million of goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Our acquisitions were recorded in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations , and ASC 820, using the acquisition method of accounting. The purchase price for acquisitions was allocated based on estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities at the date of the acquisition. The combined excess purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of the net assets is classified as goodwill and is included on the accompanying unaudited consolidated balance sheets in Prepaids, other assets and goodwill. In accordance with ASC 350, we assess the recoverability of goodwill annually, or more frequently, if impairment indicators are present.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we reflected the applicable excise tax on share repurchases in Additional paid-in capital as part of the cost basis of the stock repurchased and recorded a corresponding liability in Accrued liabilities on the accompanying unaudited consolidated balance sheets.

 . The 2018 Plan is administered by our Board of Directors and allows for the grant of stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance share awards and performance-based awards in addition to non-qualified and incentive stock options. All available shares from expired, terminated, or forfeited awards that remained under prior plans were merged into and became available for grant under the 2018 Plan. The 2018 Plan authorizes awards to officers, key employees, non-employee directors and consultants. The 2018 Plan authorizes shares of stock to be awarded, of which shares remain available for grant at September 30, 2024. We believe that such awards provide a means of long-term compensation to attract and retain qualified employees and better align the interests of our employees with those of our stockholders. Non-vested stock awards are usually granted with a ratable vesting period for employees, a cliff vesting for both restricted stock units and performance-based awards granted to executive officers and either a cliff vesting or vesting for non-employee directors, dependent on their start date.

 We also offer a non-qualified deferred compensation plan ("Deferred Compensation Plan") to highly compensated employees in order to allow them additional pre-tax income deferrals above and beyond the limits that qualified plans, such as 401(k) plans, impose on highly compensated employees. We do not currently offer a contribution match on the Deferred Compensation Plan. All contributions to the plan to date have been funded by the employees and, therefore, we have no associated expense related to the Deferred Compensation Plan for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023, other than minor administrative costs.

 principal business segments: homebuilding and financial services. As defined in ASC 280-10, Segment Reporting , we have homebuilding operating segments. The homebuilding segments are engaged in the business of acquiring and developing land, constructing homes, marketing and selling those homes and providing warranty and customer services. We aggregate our homebuilding operating segments into reporting segments based on similar long-term economic characteristics and geographical proximity. Our three reportable homebuilding segments are as follows: West: 
 Arizona, California, Colorado and Utah 
 Central: 
 Texas 
 East: 
 Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee 
 
 Management s evaluation of segment performance is based on homebuilding segment operating income, which we define as home and land closing revenue less cost of home and land closings, including land development and other land sales costs, commissions and other sales costs, and other general and administrative costs incurred by or allocated to each segment, including impairments.

Special Note of Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 In passing the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 PSLRA ), Congress encouraged public companies to make forward-looking statements by creating a safe-harbor to protect companies from securities law liability in connection with forward-looking statements. We intend to qualify both our written and oral forward-looking statements for protection under the PSLRA. 
 The words believe, expect, anticipate, forecast, plan, intend, may, will, should, could, estimate, "target," and project and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date the statement was made. All statements we make other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements within the meaning of that term in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"). Forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report include statements concerning our belief that we have ample liquidity; our goals, strategies and strategic initiatives including our all-spec strategy and the anticipated benefits relating thereto; our intentions and the expected benefits and advantages of our product and land positioning strategies, including with respect to our focus on the first-time and first move-up home buyer and housing demand for affordable homes; the benefits of and our intentions to use options to acquire land; our positions and our expected outcome relating to litigation and regulatory proceedings in general; our intentions to pay quarterly dividends; the sustainability of our tax positions; that we may repurchase our debt and equity securities; our non-use of derivative financial instruments; expectations regarding our industry and our business for the remainder of 2024 and beyond; the demand for and the pricing of our homes; our land and lot acquisition strategy (including that we will redeploy cash to acquire well-positioned finished lots and that we may participate in joint ventures or opportunities outside of our existing markets if opportunities arise and the benefits relating thereto); that we may expand into new markets; the availability of labor and materials for our operations; that we may seek additional debt or equity capital; our expectation that existing guarantees, letters of credit and performance and surety bonds will not be drawn on; the sufficiency of our insurance coverage and legal and warranty reserves; the outcome of pending litigation; the sources and sufficiency of our capital resources to support our business strategy; the sufficiency of our land pipeline; the impact of new accounting standards and changes in accounting estimates; trends and expectations concerning future demand for homes, home construction cycle times, sales prices, sales incentives, sales orders, cancellations, construction and materials costs and availability, general and administrative costs, gross margins, land costs, inflation, community counts and profitability and future home supply and inventories; our future cash needs and sources, and the impact of seasonality. 
 
 Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements, and that could negatively affect our business include, but are not limited to, the following: increases in interest rates or decreases in mortgage availability, and the cost and use of rate locks and buy-downs; inflation in the cost of materials used to develop communities and construct homes; cancellation rates; supply chain and labor constraints; the ability of our potential buyers to sell their existing homes; our ability to acquire and develop lots may be negatively impacted if we are unable to obtain performance and surety bonds; the adverse effect of slow absorption rates; legislation related to tariffs; impairments of our real estate inventory; competition; home warranty and construction defect claims; failures in health and safety performance; fluctuations in quarterly operating results; our level of indebtedness; our exposure to counterparty risk with respect to our capped calls; our ability to obtain financing if our credit ratings are downgraded; our exposure to and impacts from natural disasters or severe weather conditions; the availability and cost of finished lots and undeveloped land; the success of our strategy to offer and market entry-level and first move-up homes; a change to the feasibility of projects under option or contract that could result in the write-down or write-off of earnest money or option deposits; our limited geographic diversification; shortages in the availability and cost of subcontract labor; the replication of our energy-efficient technologies by our competitors; our exposure to information technology failures and security breaches and the impact thereof; the loss of key personnel; changes in tax laws that adversely impact us or our homebuyers; our inability to prevail on contested tax positions; failure of our employees and representatives to comply with laws and regulations; our compliance with government regulations; liabilities or restrictions resulting from regulations applicable to our financial services operations; negative publicity that affects our reputation; potential disruptions to our business by an epidemic or pandemic, and measures that federal, state and local governments and/or health authorities implement to address it; and other factors identified in documents filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the caption "Risk Factors." 
 Forward-looking statements express expectations of future events. All forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, as they are based on various expectations and assumptions concerning future events and they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those projected. Due to these inherent uncertainties, the investment community is urged not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. In addition, we disclaim and undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to projections over time, except as required by law.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Overview and Outlook 
 
 Our solid results for the third quarter of 2024 reflected the pivot in our strategy to providing affordable, move-in ready homes with a 60-day closing ready commitment. We continued to offer interest rate buy-downs in the quarter and were further aided in mid-September by the federal interest rate reductions, which contributed to orders volume that slightly outpaced traditional seasonality. The demand for our product, primarily immediately available entry-level homes, has been spurred by life events within the largest U.S. population groups of Millennials, Baby Boomers, and now Gen Z, that necessitate a housing change, amid a backdrop of a persistent shortage of existing housing supply. Our spec building strategy and streamlined operations provide us with appropriate levels of available inventory to capitalize on this demand by providing a quick move-in opportunity, one of the most desirable characteristics for our potential customers and creates an offering similar to the missing resale product. Although mortgage interest rates remain volatile, we believe that our interest rate buy-downs and other financing incentives provide us with a competitive advantage over resale homes and new home builders that do not offer such incentives. 
 We believe that the execution of our strategy has, and will continue to, drive strong performance of the key financial measures of home closing volume, home closing gross margin, selling, general and administrative cost leveraging, balance sheet management and long-term community count growth. Supply chain disruptions that impacted production costs and cycle times in the homebuilding industry as a whole over the last several years began to ease in 2023 and have continued to improve, leading to significant improvements in 2024. We believe that cycle times will approximate normal conditions for the remainder of 2024. 
 Summary Company Results 
 
 Home closing units volume of 3,942 homes in the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 8.4 from 3,638 homes in the same prior year period. Home closing revenue of 1.6 billion decreased 1.5 as the increase in volume was more than offset by a 9.1 decrease in average sales price ("ASP") on closings, due primarily to a combination of product mix and geography shift as well as increased utilization of incentives. Entry-level homes represented 93 of closings in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 86 in the third quarter of 2023. Third quarter 2024 home closing gross margin of 24.8 decreased 190 basis points for home closing gross profit of 392.6 million compared to 26.7 and 429.6 million, respectively, in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in home closing gross margin is primarily due to higher lot costs, increased utilization of incentives and reduced leverage of fixed costs on lower home closing revenue, all of which were partially offset by direct cost savings and shorter construction cycle times. Commissions and other sales costs of 97.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 1.2 million, largely as a result of lower home closing revenue. General and administrative expenses of 59.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 3.9 million from 63.1 million in the same period of 2023 primarily from lower performance based compensation expense. Other income, net of 10.7 million decreased 2.6 million due to less interest earned on a lower average cash balance. In the third quarter of 2023, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of 0.9 million in connection with the 150.0 million partial redemption of our 6.00 senior notes due 2025 (the "2025 Notes"). There were no such redemptions in the third quarter of 2024. Earnings before income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 249.9 million decreased 35.8 million year over year from 285.7 million in 2023. The effective income tax rate of 21.6 and 22.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, reflect the benefit from earned eligible energy tax credits on qualifying homes under the Inflation Reduction Act ("IRA"). The decrease in year-over-year profitability resulted in net earnings of 196.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 versus 221.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 15.4 higher home closing volume led to a 7.5 improvement in home closing revenue as compared to 2023, as lower ASP on closings partially offset the higher home closing volume. Home closing gross margin of 25.5 improved 80 basis points year over year, for a 121.0 million increase in home closing gross profit. Higher gross margin and profitability and an effective tax rate of 21.5 led to net income of 613.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 539.9 million for the 2023 period. 
 
 Home orders of 3,512 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were mostly in line with 3,474 home orders in the prior year quarter due to a consistent orders pace of 4.1 per month in both periods and a consistent average active community count. Home order value decreased 4.7 year-over-year to 1.4 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2024, versus 1.5 billion in the same period of 2023. This year over year decline was the result of a 5.7 decrease in ASP on orders, mainly from product and geographic mix, and increased usage of financing incentives. Entry-level homes represented 92 of 
 24 

orders in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 88 in the third quarter of 2023. Our cancellation rate of 10 in the third quarter of 2024 slightly improved from 11 in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, home orders and home order value increased 9.7 and 3.4 , respectively, over the prior year and the cancellation rate of 9 improved from 13 in the prior year period. We ended the third quarter of 2024 with 2,284 homes in backlog valued at 0.9 million, decreases of 36.7 and 40.2 , respectively, from September 30, 2023. The lower backlog units is directly tied to our higher backlog conversion rate of 145.2 during the third quarter of 2024, compared to 96.4 in the second quarter of 2023. As anticipated with our strategy of offering move-in ready homes with a 60-day closing ready commitment, we are selling a higher percentage of spec homes later in the construction cycle, contributing to the higher backlog conversion rate. 
 
 We ended the third quarter of 2024 with 278 active communities, up from 272 at September 30, 2023. We purchased approximately 13,900 lots for 787.3 million, spent 933.6 million on land development and started construction on 12,259 homes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Company Positioning 
 We believe that the investments in our new communities designed for the first-time and first move-up homebuyer, our move-in ready homes with a 60-day closing ready commitment, and our partnership with external realtors create a differentiated strategy that has aided us in our growth in the highly competitive new home market. 
 
 Our focus on growing our community count and market share includes the following strategic initiatives: 
 Delivering affordable homes on a shorter timeline through simplification of production processes and maintaining levels of spec inventory that are aligned with our strategy; 
 Offering our customers affordable, turnkey homes; 
 Embracing external realtor relationships, as we view realtors as a trusted resource for potential customers, particularly for first-time buyers; 
 Continuously improving the overall home buying experience through simplification and innovation; and 
 Increasing homeowner satisfaction by offering healthier, energy-efficient homes that come equipped with a suite of home automation standard features. 
 In addition to these strategic initiatives, we also remain committed to the following: 
 Achieving or maintaining a top 5 market position in all of our markets; 
 Targeting a strong, yet sustainable, orders pace through the use of consumer, market and artificial intelligence research to ensure that we build homes that offer our buyers their desired features and amenities; 
 Maintaining and where possible, expanding, our home closing gross profit by growing closing volume, allowing us to better leverage our direct overhead; 
 Carefully managing our liquidity and a strong balance sheet. We ended the third quarter of 2024 with a 20.7 debt-to-capital ratio and an 8.8 net debt-to-capital ratio, after issuing 575.0 million of convertible senior notes during the second quarter of 2024; 
 Balancing return of capital to our shareholders with internal growth goals, utilizing both share repurchases and dividend payments; 
 Managing construction efficiencies and costs through national and regional vendor relationships with a focus on timely, quality construction and warranty management; and 
 Promoting a positive environment for our employees through our commitment to foster diversity, equity and inclusion and providing market-competitive benefits in order to develop and motivate our employees, minimize turnover and maximize recruitment efforts.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The critical accounting estimates that we deem to involve the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments include real estate valuation and cost of home closings, warranty reserves and valuation of deferred tax assets. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to those disclosed in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the "Annual Report").

Home Closing Revenue, Home Orders and Order Backlog 
 The composition of our closings, home orders and backlog is constantly changing and is based on a changing mix of communities with various price points between periods as new projects open and existing projects wind down and close-out. Further, individual homes within a community can range significantly in price due to differing square footage, option selections, lot sizes and quality and location of lots (e.g. cul-de-sac, view lots, greenbelt lots). These variations result in a lack of meaningful comparability between our home orders, closings and backlog due to the changing mix between periods. The tables on the following pages present operating and financial data that we consider most critical to managing our operations (dollars in thousands):

Operating Results 
 
 Companywide . We reported our highest third quarter home closing volume in Company history, with 3,942 closings for the three months ended September 30, 2024, up 8.4 from 3,638 closings in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in home closing volume was due to a higher backlog conversion rate of 145.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 96.4 in the same period of 2023. Despite the increase in home closing volume, home closing revenue of 1.6 billion decreased 1.5 as the higher home closing volume was offset by a 9.1 lower ASP on closings, primarily the result of product and geographic mix shifts and increased utilization of financing incentives. Entry-level homes represented 93 of third quarter 2024 closings compared to 86 in the third quarter of 2023. Home order volume in the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 3,512 homes were relatively consistent with 3,474 homes in the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to similar average active community count and orders pace of 4.1 homes per month in both of the three month periods ending September 30, 2024 and 2023. The 1.1 increase in home order volume combined with a 5.7 decrease in ASP on home orders led to overall 4.7 lower home order value of 1.4 billion in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.5 billion in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decline in ASP on orders was driven by a higher percentage of entry-level, a shift in geographic mix and increased incentives, similar to ASP on home closings. Order cancellations of 10 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were down from 11 in the three months ended September 30, 2023; the current run rate for cancellations across the company is below our historical company average and demonstrates the tightening of overall inventory availability and attractiveness of move-in ready homes with a 60-day closing ready commitment coupled with our financing incentives. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, home closing volume increased 15.4 to 11,567 closings, which led to home closing revenue of 4.7 billion, up 7.5 from 4.4 billion in the prior year. The increased volume was partially offset by a 6.8 year-over-year decrease in ASP on closings. Home order volume of 11,302 was up 9.7 and home order value of 4.6 billion was up 3.4 from prior year due to higher volume and a 5.7 decrease in ASP on orders. The increase in home order volume was driven entirely by 9.8 increase in orders pace of 4.5 homes per month, compared to 4.1 in 2023, on a relatively flat average active community count. We ended the third quarter of 2024 with 278 actively selling communities, up from 272 at September 30, 2023. The quarter ended with 2,284 homes in backlog valued at 931.7 million, compared to 3,608 units valued at 1.6 billion at September 30, 2023. The lower backlog year over year is a result of the significant improvement in our backlog conversion rate, as we are selling spec homes later in the construction cycle. 
 West . The West Region generated 594.5 million in home closing revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024, a 2.0 decrease compared to the 606.8 million in prior year period. The lower revenue was due to lower ASP on closings, which was partially offset by 4.1 higher volume of 1,220 homes in the three months ended September 30, 2024, up from 1,172 homes in the prior year period. The 5.9 year over year decline in ASP is due to geographic mix within the region, as well as product mix shift to more entry-level homes. Home orders in the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 1,067 were up 8.3 from 985 in the prior year, resulting from a 16.7 increase in orders pace to 4.2 homes per month, more than offsetting the 6.0 lower number of average active communities. Although the West Region average active community count is down from 2023, it has increased sequentially from the second quarter of 2024. Home order value of 521.0 million for the third quarter of 2024 was consistent with prior year as the impact of the higher order volume was offset by a 7.7 lower ASP on orders caused by geographic and product mix shift. The West Region cancellation rate of 10 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 improved from 14 in the prior year. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, home closing revenue of 1.7 billion increased 12.3 due to an 18.4 increase in home closing volume, while ASP on closings decreased 5.2 compared to prior year due to geographic and product mix shift, as previously mentioned. Home order volume in the West Region of 3,351 increased 2.8 as a 15.4 increase in orders pace to 4.5 homes per month was mostly offset by the 10.6 decrease in the average number of actively selling communities. Home order value of 1.7 billion was down 0.8 due to a 3.5 lower ASP. The year-to-date cancellation rate of 10 improved from 14 in the prior year period. The West Region ended the third quarter of 2024 with 598 homes in backlog valued at 286.3 million, compared to 1,179 units valued at 579.8 million at September 30, 2023. The lower backlog is due entirely to a higher backlog conversion rate of 162.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 85.8 in the same period of 2023. 
 Central . The Central Region closed 1,174 homes in the three months ended September 30, 2024, up 6.5 from 1,102 in the prior year period due to an increase in the backlog conversion rate of 157.4 compared to 114.9 for the same prior year period. Home closing revenue of 416.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was down 7.9 from the prior year period, as the higher volume was offset by a 13.6 decrease in ASP on closings due to product mix shift and higher utilization of incentives. Home order volume decreased 6.2 to 1,031 homes in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as a 9.8 decrease in average active communities outweighed the 2.2 orders pace improvement to 4.6 homes per month. Home order value of 366.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 declined 13.8 from 425.2 million in the prior 
 30 

year quarter due the combined impact of lower home order volume and an 8.1 decrease in ASP on orders caused by product mix shift to more entry-level homes and increased utilization of financing incentives. The Central Region cancellation rate of 11 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 improved from 13 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Year-to-date, the Central Region closed 3,606 homes, an 11.2 increase over prior year, and had relatively flat home closing revenue of 1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as the increase in volume was muted by a 12.1 decrease in ASP on closings. Home order volume increased 6.3 , partially offset by an 8.7 drop in ASP on orders, leading to a 2.9 overall decrease in home order value of 1.2 billion. Order volume benefited from a 9.1 increase in orders pace to 4.8 homes per month that was partially offset by a 3.2 decrease in average active communities. The year-to-date cancellation rate of 11 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 improved from 14 in the prior year period. The Central Region ended the quarter with 603 units in backlog valued at 223.9 million, down 36.9 and 39.5 , respectively, compared to September 30, 2023, due to the higher backlog conversion rate discussed previously. 
 East . During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the East Region closed 1,548 homes for 574.5 million, compared to 1,364 closings and 550.8 million in home closing revenue in the comparable prior year period. The 13.5 increase in volume, largely benefiting from the 127.2 backlog conversion rate, was partially offset by an 8.1 lower ASP on home closings. The decline in ASP on home closings was due to product mix shift and increased financing incentives. Home orders of 1,414 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.7 due to a 13.4 higher average active community count offset by an 11.6 lower orders pace of 3.8 homes for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in orders pace was a function of the timing of community openings and closings. Order value of 538.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, was down 2.1 from 549.3 million in the prior year period due to the 1.7 higher volume, partially offset by the 3.7 lower ASP on orders. The combination of product mix shift and increased financing incentives led to the lower ASP on orders. The East Region cancellation rate of 10 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was up from 8 in the same prior year period but still well below our historical company average. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the East Region saw improvements in home closing volume and revenue of 16.6 and 11.2 improvements in, respectively, compared to the 2023 period, closing 4,462 homes for 1.7 billion in home closing revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Home order volume increased 18.6 due to an 11.8 increase in average active communities coupled with a 4.9 higher orders pace for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The higher order volume led to a 13.4 increase in home order value of 1.7 billion, as ASP on orders declined 4.4 due to a higher mix of entry-level homes. Year-to-date, the East Region's cancellation rate of 8 saw a significant drop from 11 in the prior year. The East Region ended the third quarter of 2024 with 1,083 homes in backlog valued at 421.5 million, down 26.5 and 30.7 , respectively, from 1,473 homes valued at 608.6 million at September 30, 2023.

 (1) Home closing gross profit represents home closing revenue less cost of home closings, including impairments, if any. Cost of home closings includes land and associated development costs, direct home construction costs, an allocation of common community costs (such as architectural, legal and zoning costs), interest, sales tax, impact fees, warranty, construction overhead and closing costs. 
 Companywide . Home closing gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 392.6 million, with a home closing gross margin of 24.8 , down 190 basis points from 26.7 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The margin decline was due to the combined effect of higher lot costs, increased utilization of financing incentives and, to a lessor extent, reduced leverage of fixed costs on lower home closing revenue, which were partially offset by cost savings and shorter construction cycle times. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit of 1.2 billion and margin of 25.5 increased from 1.1 billion and 24.7 in nine months ended September 30, 2023, for a gross margin improvement of 80 basis points, due to lower direct costs, leverage of higher home closing revenue on overhead costs and shorter construction cycle times, partially offset by higher lot costs. 
 
 West. The West Region had home closing gross margin of 23.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, flat with the three months ended September 30, 2023, as higher lots costs offset the savings in direct costs and shorter construction cycle times. Year-to-date gross margin improved 300 basis point to 23.2 in 2024 compared to 20.2 in 2023 due to direct cost savings, leverage of higher home closing revenue on overhead costs and shorter construction cycle times, all of which were partially offset by higher lot costs. Additionally, home closing gross margin for both the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2023 were negatively impacted by significant financing incentives to address affordability concerns. 
 
 Central. The Central Region home closing gross margin of 26.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 230 basis points from 28.4 in the prior year quarter as a result of increased utilization of financing incentives, higher lot costs and reduced leverage of fixed costs on lower home closing revenue, which were partially offset by direct cost savings and shorter construction cycle times. Year-to-date, the Central Region gross margin of 26.8 in 2024 was relatively consistent with 27.0 in 2023. 
 East. The East Region home closing gross margin of 25.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, down 370 basis points from 29.0 for the comparable 2023 period, due to higher lot costs and utilization of financing incentives, which more than offset savings in direct costs and leverage of higher home closing revenue on overhead costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, East Region home closing gross margin of 26.8 decreased 30 basis points as lower direct costs and leverage of higher home closing revenue on overhead costs were exceeded by higher lot costs.

Financial Services Profit (in thousands) Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Financial services profit 3,101 5,700 7,248 6,066 
 Financial services profit represents the net profit/(loss) of our financial services operations, including the operating profit generated by our wholly-owned title and insurance companies, Carefree Title Agency, Inc. and Meritage Homes Insurance Agency, Inc., respectively, as well as our portion of earnings from a mortgage joint venture. Financial services profit of 3.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 2.6 million from 5.7 million in the same prior year period, primarily due to current period charges of 3.0 million related to expired interest rate forward commitments, which were offset by higher profits for both the title and insurance companies as a result of higher home closing volume. There were no charges related to expired interest rate forward commitments in the third quarter of 2023. Similar to the third quarter results, year-to-date financial services profit increased 1.2 million as greater title and insurance company profits were offset by higher charges related to unused interest rate forward commitments of 10.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 9.8 million in the prior year period. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses and Other Expenses (dollars in thousands) Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Commissions and other sales costs (97,898) (99,122) (304,113) (277,766) Percent of home closing revenue 6.2 6.2 6.4 6.3 General and administrative expenses (59,198) (63,091) (163,114) (162,750) Percent of home closing revenue 3.7 3.9 3.4 3.7 Interest expense Other income, net 10,682 13,331 31,202 35,037 Loss on early extinguishment of debt (907) (631) (907) Provision for income taxes (53,966) (63,974) (167,771) (150,664) 
 
 Commissions and Other Sales Costs. Commissions and other sales costs are comprised of internal and external commissions and related sales and marketing expenses such as advertising and sales office costs. These costs decreased 1.2 million to 97.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period, primarily due to decreased commissions expense on lower home closing revenue, partially offset by increased costs associated with maintaining higher levels of spec inventory. Commissions and other sales costs were 6.2 of home closing revenue in both third quarter periods. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, commissions and other sales costs of 304.1 million were 6.4 of home closing revenue, increases of 26.3 million and 10 basis points, respectively, due to higher home closing revenue and increased costs associated with maintaining higher levels of spec inventory. 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses represent corporate and divisional overhead expenses such as salaries and bonuses, occupancy, insurance and travel expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses of 59.2 million decreased 3.9 million from 63.1 million in the prior year period, and as a percentage of home closing revenue improved 20 basis points to 3.7 due primarily to lower expense associated with performance based compensation. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses of 163.1 million increased 0.4 million, but as a percentage of home closing revenue improved 30 basis points due to leverage of higher home closing revenue on fixed overhead expenses and lower performance based compensation expense. 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense is comprised of interest incurred, but not capitalized, on our senior and convertible senior notes, loans payable and other borrowings, and our revolving credit facility agreement ("Credit Facility"). We recognized no interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 because all interest was capitalized to qualifying assets. 
 Other Income, Net. Other income, net, primarily consists of (i) sublease income, (ii) interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents, (iii) payments and awards related to legal settlements and (iv) our portion of pre-tax income or loss from non-financial services joint ventures. Other income, net was 10.7 million and 13.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 31.2 million and 35.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decreases in both the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 are due to less interest earned on a lower average cash balance. 
 33 

Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was zero and 0.6 million loss on early extinguishment of debt, respectively, related to the May 2024 250.0 million final redemption of our 2025 Notes. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, loss on early extinguishment of debt of 0.9 million was related to the 150.0 million partial redemption of our 2025 Notes. See Note 6 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information related to the redemption of our 2025 Notes. 
 Income Taxes. Our effective tax rate was 21.6 and 22.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and was 21.5 and 21.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The rate for all periods reflect energy-efficient homes tax credits on qualifying homes under the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") 45L energy-efficient homes federal tax credit. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 We have historically generated cash and funded our operations primarily from cash flows from operating activities. Additional sources of funds may include additional debt or equity financing and borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility. We exercise strict controls and believe we have a prudent strategy for Company-wide cash management, including those related to cash outlays for land acquisition and development and spec home construction. Our principal uses of cash include acquisition and development of land and lots, home construction, operating expenses, share repurchases and the payment of interest, routine liabilities and dividends. We may also opportunistically repurchase our senior notes. 
 Cash flows for each of our communities depend on their stage of the development cycle, and can differ substantially from reported earnings. Early stages of development or expansion require significant cash outlays for land acquisitions, zoning plat and other approvals, community and lot development, and construction of model homes, roads, utilities, landscape and other amenities. Because these costs are a component of our inventory and are not recognized in our income statement until a home closes, we incur significant cash outlays prior to recognition of earnings. In the later stages of a community, cash inflows may significantly exceed earnings reported for financial statement purposes, as the cash outflow associated with home and land construction was previously incurred. Similarly, in times of community count growth, we incur significant outlays of cash through the land purchase, development and community opening stages whereas in in times of community count stability, these cash outlays are incurred in a more even-flow cadence with cash inflows from actively selling communities that are contributing closing volume and home closing revenue. Conversely, in a down turn environment, cash outlays for land and community count growth may be scaled back to preserve liquidity and we may curtail community count. 
 Short-term Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Over the course of the next twelve months, we expect that our primary demand for funds will be for the construction of homes, as well as acquisition and development of both new and existing lots, operating expenses, including general and administrative expenses, interest and dividend payments and common stock repurchases. Although we don't anticipate any early redemptions in the near term, we may opportunistically retire or redeem a portion of our senior notes. We expect to meet these short-term liquidity requirements primarily through our cash and cash equivalents on hand and the net cash flows provided by our operations. 
 Between our cash and cash equivalents on hand combined with the availability of liquidity from our Credit Facility, we believe that we currently have sufficient liquidity. Nevertheless, in the future, we may seek additional capital to strengthen our liquidity position, enable us to acquire additional land inventory in anticipation of improving market conditions, and/or strengthen our long-term capital structure. 
 Long-term Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Beyond the next twelve months, our principal demands for funds will be for the construction of homes, land acquisition and development activities needed to maintain our lot supply and active community count, payments of principal and interest on our senior and convertible senior notes as they become due or mature, share repurchases and dividend payments. We expect our existing and future generated cash will be adequate to fund our ongoing operating activities as well as provide capital for investment in future land purchases and related development activities. To the extent the sources of capital described above are insufficient to meet our long-term cash needs, we may also conduct additional public offerings of our securities, refinance or secure new debt or dispose of certain assets to fund our operating activities. There can be no assurances that we would be able to obtain such additional capital on terms acceptable to us, if at all, and such additional equity or debt financing could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders or increase our interest costs.

Material Cash Requirements 
 We are a party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. These obligations impact both short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Certain contractual obligations are reflected on our unaudited consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024, while others are considered future commitments for materials or services not yet provided. Our contractual obligations primarily consist of principal and interest payments on our senior and convertible senior notes, loans payable and other borrowings, including our Credit Facility, letters of credit and surety bonds and operating leases. We have no material debt maturities until 2027. We also have requirements for certain short-term lease commitments, funding working capital needs of our existing unconsolidated joint ventures and other purchase obligations in the normal course of business. Other material cash requirements include land acquisition and development costs, home construction costs and operating expenses, including our selling, general and administrative expenses, as previously discussed. We plan to fund these commitments primarily with cash flows generated by operations, but may also utilize additional debt or equity financing and borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility. Our maximum exposure to loss on our purchase and option agreements is generally limited to non-refundable deposits and capitalized or committed pre-acquisition costs. 
 For information about our loans payable and other borrowings, including our Credit Facility, senior and convertible senior notes, reference is made to Notes 5 and 6 in the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this report and are incorporated by reference herein. For information about our lease obligations, reference is made to Note 4 in the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report. 
 Reference is made to Notes 1, 3, 4, and 15 in the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this report and are incorporated by reference herein. These Notes discuss our off-balance sheet arrangements with respect to land acquisition contracts and option agreements, and land development joint ventures, including the nature and amounts of financial obligations relating to these items. In addition, these Notes discuss the nature and amounts of certain types of commitments that arise in connection with the ordinary course of our land development and homebuilding operations, including commitments of land development joint ventures for which we might be obligated, if any. 
 We do not engage in commodity trading or other similar activities. We had no derivative financial instruments that required derivative accounting under ASC 815-10, Derivatives and Hedging , at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 Operating Cash Flow Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities totaled 128.0 million, versus net cash provided by operating activities of 460.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Operating cash flows in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 benefited from cash generated by net earnings of 613.5 million, which were offset by a 723.8 million increase in real estate. Operating cash flows in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 benefited from cash generated from net earnings of 539.9 million and were partially offset by a 137.5 million increase in real estate. 
 Investing Cash Flow Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash used in investing activities totaled 31.4 million and 34.7 million. Cash used in investing activities in the first nine months of 2024 was mainly attributable to purchases of property and equipment of 21.2 million and investments in unconsolidated entities of 10.4 million. Cash used in investing activities in the first nine months of 2023 was mainly attributable to the purchases of property and equipment. 
 Financing Cash Flow Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities totaled 69.8 million as compared to net cash used in financing activities of 238.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net cash provided by financing activities in 2024 primarily reflects the net proceeds of 557.7 million from the issuance of our 1.75 Convertible Senior Notes due 2028, offset by the early redemption of our 2025 Notes of 250.0 million principal and 61.8 million for the purchase of capped calls, along with 85.9 million of share repurchases and 81.6 million of dividends paid. The net cash used in financing activities in 2023 includes 150.0 million for the partial redemption of our 2025 Notes and associated early tender fees of 0.9 million, 55.0 million in share repurchases and 29.7 million of dividends paid. See 'Part II, Item 2 - Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds' for more information about our authorized share repurchase program.

We believe that our leverage ratios provide useful information to the users of our financial statements regarding our financial position and cash and debt management. Debt-to-capital and net debt-to-capital are calculated as follows (dollars in thousands): As of September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Senior and convertible senior notes, net, loans payable and other borrowings 1,314,255 1,008,215 Stockholders equity 5,029,790 4,611,900 Total capital 6,344,045 5,620,115 Debt-to-capital (1) 
 20.7 17.9 Senior and convertible senior notes, net, loans payable and other borrowings 1,314,255 1,008,215 Less: cash and cash equivalents (831,559) (921,227) Net debt 482,696 86,988 Stockholders equity 5,029,790 4,611,900 Total net capital 5,512,486 4,698,888 Net debt-to-capital (2) 
 8.8 1.9 
 
 (1) Debt-to-capital is computed as senior and convertible senior notes, net and loans payable and other borrowings divided by the aggregate of total senior and convertible senior notes, net, loans payable and other borrowings and stockholders' equity. 
 (2) Net debt-to-capital is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, and is computed as net debt divided by the aggregate of net debt and stockholders' equity. Net debt is comprised of total senior and convertible senior notes, net and loans payable and other borrowings, less cash and cash equivalents. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is the ratio of debt-to-capital. We believe the ratio of net debt-to-capital is a relevant financial measure for investors to understand the leverage employed in our operations and as an indicator of our ability to obtain financing. 
 Dividends 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our Board of Directors approved, and we paid, a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of 0.75 and 0.27 per share, respectively. Quarterly dividends declared and paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled 2.25 and 0.81 per share, respectively.

Credit Facility Covenants 
 Borrowings under the Credit Facility are unsecured, but availability is subject to, among other things, a borrowing base. The Credit Facility also contains certain financial covenants, including (a) a minimum tangible net worth requirement of 3.3 billion (which amount is subject to increase over time based on subsequent earnings and proceeds from equity offerings), and (b) a maximum leverage covenant that prohibits the leverage ratio (as defined therein) from exceeding 60 . We were in compliance with all Credit Facility covenants as of September 30, 2024. Our actual financial covenant calculations as of September 30, 2024 are reflected in the table below. 
 Financial Covenant (dollars in thousands): Covenant Requirement Actual Minimum Tangible Net Worth > 3,485,875 4,980,814 Leverage Ratio 
 Seasonality 
 Historically, we have experienced seasonal variations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirements. We typically take orders for more homes in the first half of the fiscal year than in the second half, which has created additional working capital requirements in the second and third quarters to build our inventories to satisfy seasonally higher closings in the second half of the year. While we expect the seasonal orders pattern to continue over the long term, our higher backlog conversion rate and all-spec strategy may shift the timing of home closings and capital requirements to build our inventories to earlier in the year. Additionally, seasonality may, from time to time, be affected by short-term volatility in the homebuilding industry and in the overall economy. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 1 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this report for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Our fixed rate debt is made up primarily of 1.3 billion in aggregate principal amount of our senior and convertible senior notes. All outstanding senior and convertible senior notes bear fixed rates of interest, and therefore, do not expose us to financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. The fair values of senior and convertible senior notes change primarily when interest rates change, and in the case of our convertible senior notes, when the market price of our stock fluctuates. Except in limited circumstances, we do not have an obligation to prepay our senior notes and, as a result, changes in fair value of our senior notes should not have a significant impact until we would be required to repay such debt and access the capital markets to issue new debt. Obligations to prepay our convertible senior notes may be required upon the occurrence of certain limited conversion conditions that are closely related to the fair value of the convertible senior notes, and therefore changes in the fair value of our convertible senior notes should not have a significant impact as conversion is more likely to occur under favorable stock price conditions. Our Credit Facility is subject to interest rate changes as the borrowing rates are based on SOFR or Prime (see Note 5 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this report). 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 In order to ensure that the information we must disclose in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis, we have developed and implemented disclosure controls and procedures. Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer ("CEO") and chief financial officer ("CFO"), has reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e), as of September 30, 2024 (the Evaluation Date ). Based on such evaluation, our management has concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level in ensuring that information that is required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules 
 37 

and forms, and that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 During the fiscal quarter covered by this Form 10-Q, there has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or that is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 See Note 15 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in this report for a discussion of our legal proceedings. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item IA "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may eventually prove to materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. Except as described below, there have been no material changes in our risk factors as previously disclosed in our Annual Report. Material new risks and material changes in previously disclosed risks are presented in underlined type. 
 
 Our level of indebtedness may adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations. 
 
 The homebuilding industry is capital intensive and requires significant up-front expenditures to secure land and pursue development and construction on such land. Accordingly, we incur substantial indebtedness to finance our homebuilding activities. At September 30, 2024 , we had approximately 1.3 billion of indebtedness and 831.6 million of cash and cash equivalents. If we require working capital greater than that provided by our operations and current liquidity position, including the 796.7 million available to be drawn under our credit facility, we may be required to seek additional capital in the form of equity or debt financing from a variety of potential sources, including bank financing, public bonds or off-balance sheet resources. There can be no assurance we would be able to obtain such additional capital on terms acceptable to us, if at all. The level of our indebtedness could have important consequences to our stockholders, including the following: 
 
 our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes could be impaired; 
 we could be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness, which would reduce the funds available to us for other purposes such as land and lot acquisition, development and construction activities; 
 although we have a relatively low level of indebtedness and a relatively high balance of cash and cash equivalents, some of our competitors may have additional access to capital, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage and reduce our flexibility in planning for, or responding to, changing conditions in our industry, including increased competition; and 
 we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business than some of our competitors. 
 
 Furthermore, the holders of our 1.75 Convertible Senior Notes due 2028 (the "2028 Convertible Notes") have the right to convert their notes upon the occurrence of certain conversion conditions. Upon conversion, we will be required to make cash payments up to the aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Convertible Notes to be converted and cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, at our election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Convertible Notes being converted. 
 
 We expect to generate cash flow to pay our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness with cash flow from operations or from existing working capital. Our ability to meet our expenses thus depends, to a large extent, on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions in the markets where we operate and pressure from competitors. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, issue equity or borrow additional funds. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict or limit us from pursuing any of these alternatives. 
 
 39 

We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the capped call transactions. 
 
 In connection with the issuance of the 2028 Convertible Notes, we entered into certain derivative transactions (the "capped call transactions") with the several capped call counterparties (together with their respective affiliates, the "option counterparties"). The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to our common stock upon conversion of any 2028 Convertible Notes and to offset any cash payments made in excess of the principal amount of converted 2028 Convertible Notes, as the case may be. 
 
 Although the option counterparties are investment grade international financial institutions, we will be subject to the risk that any or all of them might default under the capped call transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties is not secured by any collateral. Past global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the capped call transactions with such option counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors. For example, if a market condition existed where our stock increased above the premium but one or more option counterparties defaults under the capped call transactions, we may suffer more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurance as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 On February 13, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program, authorizing the expenditure of up to 100.0 million to repurchase shares of our common stock. On November 13, 2020, the Board of Directors authorized the expenditure of an additional 100.0 million to repurchase shares of our common stock under this program. On August 12, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the expenditure of an additional 100.0 million to repurchase shares of our common stock under this program, which was announced on August 17, 2021. On May 19, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized the expenditure of an additional 200.0 million to repurchase shares of our common stock under this program, which was announced on May 25, 2022. There is no stated expiration for this program. The repurchases of the Company's shares may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. The timing and amount of repurchases, if any, will be determined by the Company's management at its discretion and be based on a variety of factors such as the market price of the Company's common stock, corporate and contractual requirements, prevailing market and economic conditions and legal requirements. The share repurchase program may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. As of September 30, 2024 there was 99.1 million available under this program to repurchase shares. We repurchased 151,220 shares under the program during the three months ended September 30, 2024.
