 EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 This report combines the reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024 of Equity Residential and ERP Operating Limited Partnership. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to EQR mean Equity Residential, a Maryland real estate investment trust REIT ), and references to ERPOP mean ERP Operating Limited Partnership, an Illinois limited partnership. References to the Company, we, us or our mean collectively EQR, ERPOP and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by EQR and/or ERPOP. References to the Operating Partnership mean collectively ERPOP and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by ERPOP. The following chart illustrates the Company s and the Operating Partnership s corporate structure: 

EQR is the general partner of, and as of September 30, 2024 owned an approximate 97.0 ownership interest in, ERPOP. The remaining 3.0 interest is owned by limited partners. As the sole general partner of ERPOP, EQR has exclusive control of ERPOP s day-to-day management. Management operates the Company and the Operating Partnership as one business. The management of EQR consists of the same members as the management of ERPOP. 
 The Company is structured as an umbrella partnership REIT UPREIT and EQR contributes all net proceeds from its various equity offerings to ERPOP. In return for those contributions, EQR receives a number of OP Units (see definition below) in ERPOP equal to the number of Common Shares it has issued in the equity offering. The Company may acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of OP Units as consideration for the acquired properties. Such transactions may, in certain circumstances, enable the sellers to defer in whole or in part, the recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise result from the sales. This is one of the reasons why the Company is structured in the manner shown above. Based on the terms of ERPOP s partnership agreement, OP Units can be exchanged with Common Shares on a one-for-one basis because the Company maintains a one-for-one relationship between the OP Units of ERPOP issued to EQR and the outstanding Common Shares. 
 The Company believes that combining the reports on Form 10-Q of EQR and ERPOP into this single report provides the following benefits: 
 	 enhances investors understanding of the Company and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business; 
 	 eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation since a substantial portion of the disclosure applies to both the Company and the Operating Partnership; and 
 	 creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports. 

Table of Contents 

 The Company believes it is important to understand the few differences between EQR and ERPOP in the context of how EQR and ERPOP operate as a consolidated company. All of the Company s property ownership, development and related business operations are conducted through the Operating Partnership and EQR has no material assets or liabilities other than its investment in ERPOP. EQR s primary function is acting as the general partner of ERPOP. EQR also issues equity from time to time, the net proceeds of which it is obligated to contribute to ERPOP. EQR does not have any indebtedness as all debt is incurred by the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership holds substantially all of the assets of the Company, including the Company s ownership interests in its joint ventures. The Operating Partnership conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for the net proceeds from equity offerings by EQR (which are contributed to the capital of ERPOP in exchange for additional partnership interests in ERPOP OP Units (on a one-for-one Common Share per OP Unit basis) or additional preference units in ERPOP (on a one-for-one preferred share per preference unit basis)), the Operating Partnership generates all remaining capital required by the Company s business. These sources include the Operating Partnership s working capital, net cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under its revolving credit facility and/or commercial paper program, the issuance of secured and unsecured debt and partnership interests, and proceeds received from disposition of certain properties and joint venture interests. 
 Shareholders equity, partners capital and noncontrolling interests are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of the Company and those of the Operating Partnership. The limited partners of the Operating Partnership are accounted for as partners capital in the Operating Partnership s financial statements and as noncontrolling interests in the Company s financial statements. The noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership s financial statements include the interests of unaffiliated partners in various consolidated partnerships. The noncontrolling interests in the Company s financial statements include the same noncontrolling interests at the Operating Partnership level and limited partner OP Unit holders of the Operating Partnership. The differences between shareholders equity and partners capital result from differences in the equity issued at the Company and Operating Partnership levels. 
 To help investors understand the differences between the Company and the Operating Partnership, this report provides separate consolidated financial statements for the Company and the Operating Partnership; a single set of consolidated notes to such financial statements that includes separate discussions of each entity s debt, noncontrolling interests and shareholders equity or partners capital, as applicable; and a combined Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section that includes discrete information related to each entity. 
 This report also includes separate Part I, Item 4, Controls and Procedures , sections and separate Exhibits 31 and 32 certifications for each of the Company and the Operating Partnership in order to establish that the requisite certifications have been made and that the Company and the Operating Partnership are compliant with Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and 18 U.S.C. 1350. 
 In order to highlight the differences between the Company and the Operating Partnership, the separate sections in this report for the Company and the Operating Partnership specifically refer to the Company and the Operating Partnership. In the sections that combine disclosure of the Company and the Operating Partnership, this report refers to actions or holdings as being actions or holdings of the Company. Although the Operating Partnership is generally the entity that directly or indirectly enters into contracts and joint ventures and holds assets and debt, reference to the Company is appropriate because the Company is one business and the Company operates that business through the Operating Partnership. 
 As general partner with control of ERPOP, EQR consolidates ERPOP for financial reporting purposes, and EQR essentially has no assets or liabilities other than its investment in ERPOP. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of the Company and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements. The separate discussions of the Company and the Operating Partnership in this report should be read in conjunction with each other to understand the results of the Company on a consolidated basis and how management operates the Company.

All of the Company s property ownership, development and related business operations are conducted through the Operating Partnership and EQR has no material assets or liabilities other than its investment in ERPOP. EQR issues equity from time to time, the net proceeds of which it is obligated to contribute to ERPOP, but does not have any indebtedness as all debt is incurred by the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership holds substantially all of the assets of the Company, including the Company s ownership interests in its joint ventures. The Operating Partnership conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. As of September 30, 2024, the Company, directly or indirectly through investments in title holding entities, owned all or a portion of properties located in states and the District of Columbia consisting of apartment units .

 provision for federal income taxes at the EQR level. In addition, ERPOP generally is not liable for federal income taxes as the partners recognize their allocable share of income or loss in their tax returns; therefore no provision for federal income taxes has been made at the ERPOP level. Historically, the Company has generally only incurred certain state and local income, excise and franchise taxes. The Company has elected taxable REIT subsidiary TRS status for certain of its corporate subsidiaries and, as a result, these entities will incur both federal and state income taxes on any taxable income of such entities after consideration of any net operating losses.

Limited Partner Units Ownership Interest in Operating Partnership 

The equity positions of various individuals and entities that contributed their properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units, as well as the equity positions of the holders of restricted units, are collectively referred to as the Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership and Limited Partners Capital, respectively, for the Company and the Operating Partnership. Subject to certain exceptions (including the book-up requirements of restricted units), the Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership/Limited Partners Capital may exchange their Units with EQR for Common Shares on a one-for-one basis. The carrying value of the Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership/Limited Partners Capital (including redeemable interests) is allocated based on the number of Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership/Limited Partners Capital in total in proportion to the number of Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership/Limited Partners Capital in total plus the total number of Common Shares/General Partner Units. Net income is allocated to the Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership/Limited Partners Capital based on the weighted average ownership percentage during the period. The Operating Partnership has the right but not the obligation to make a cash payment instead of issuing Common Shares to any and all holders of Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership/Limited Partners Capital requesting an exchange of their Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership/Limited Partners Capital with EQR. Once the Operating Partnership elects not to redeem the Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership/Limited Partners Capital for cash, EQR is obligated to deliver Common Shares to the exchanging holder of the Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership/Limited Partners Capital.

Balance at September 30, 

Net proceeds from EQR Common Share and Preferred Share (see definition below) offerings and proceeds from exercise of options for Common Shares are contributed by EQR to ERPOP. In return for those contributions, EQR receives a number of OP Units in ERPOP equal to the number of Common Shares it has issued in the equity offering (or in the case of a preferred equity offering, a number of preference units in ERPOP equal in number and having the same terms as the Preferred Shares issued in the equity offering). As a result, the net proceeds from Common Shares and Preferred Shares are allocated for the Company between shareholders equity and Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership and for the Operating Partnership between General Partner s Capital and Limited Partners Capital to account for the change in their respective percentage ownership of the underlying equity. The Company s declaration of trust authorizes it to issue up to preferred shares of beneficial interest, par value per share (the Preferred Shares ), with specific rights, preferences and other attributes as the Board of Trustees may determine, which may include preferences, powers and rights that are senior to the rights of holders of the Company s Common Shares. par value; shares authorized:

As a result of this partial redemption, the Company incurred a cash charge of approximately million which was recorded as a premium on the redemption of Preferred Shares/Preference Units. 

Other EQR and ERPOP currently have an active universal shelf registration statement for the issuance of equity and debt securities that automatically became effective upon filing with the SEC in May 2022 and expires in May 2025. Per the terms of ERPOP s partnership agreement, EQR contributes the net proceeds of all equity offerings to the capital of ERPOP in exchange for additional OP Units (on a one-for-one Common Share per OP Unit basis) or preference units (on a one-for-one preferred share per preference unit basis). The Company has an At-The-Market ATM share offering program which allows EQR to issue Common Shares from time to time into the existing trading market at current market prices or through negotiated transactions, including under forward sale arrangements. The current program matures in May 2025 and gives us the authority to issue up to million shares, all of which remain available for issuance as of September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company repurchased and subsequently retired approximately million shares at a weighted average price per share of of its Common Shares in the open market under its share repurchase program. Concurrent with these transactions, ERPOP repurchased and retired the same amount of OP Units previously issued to EQR. Prior to the share repurchase activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company had the authority to repurchase up to million Common Shares under its share repurchase program, of which shares remain authorized to repurchase as of September 30, 2024 .

Total Projects Under Development 

(1) The Company s share of the million in total project costs remaining approximates million, with the balance funded by the Company s joint venture partners (approximately million) and/or applicable construction loans (approximately million). 

We have entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, joint venture agreements with third-party partners for the development of multifamily rental properties. The joint venture agreements with each development partner include buy-sell provisions that provide the right, but not the obligation, for the Company to acquire each respective partner s interests or sell its interests at any time following the occurrence of certain pre-defined events described in the joint venture agreements. See Note 5 for additional discussion. Other Commitments We have entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, real estate technology and other real estate fund investments. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company has invested in separate such investments totaling million with aggregate remaining commitments of approximately million. Contingencies Litigation and Legal Matters The Company, as an owner of real estate, is subject to various federal, state and local laws. Compliance by the Company with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on the Company. However, the Company cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on its current properties or on properties that it may acquire in the future. The Company is involved in various pending and threatened legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company evaluates these litigation matters on an ongoing basis, but in no event less than quarterly, in assessing the adequacy of its accruals and disclosures. For legal proceedings in which it has been determined that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company records new accruals and/or adjusts existing accruals that represent its best estimate of the loss incurred based on the facts and circumstances known at that time. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company s litigation accruals approximated million and million, respectively, and are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Actual losses may differ materially from the amounts noted above and the ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings is generally not yet determinable. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company does not believe there is any litigation pending or threatened against it that, either individually or in the aggregate and inclusive of the matters accrued for as noted above, may reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company and its financial condition. The Company has been named as a defendant in a number of cases filed in late 2022 and 2023 alleging antitrust violations by RealPage, Inc., a seller of revenue management software products, and various owners and/or operators of multifamily housing, including us, that have utilized these products. The complaints allege collusion among the defendants to illegally fix and inflate the pricing of multifamily rents and seek monetary damages, injunctive relief, fees and costs. All of the cases except for one have been consolidated into a single putative class action in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. On December 28, 2023, motions to dismiss this consolidated action, filed by RealPage, Inc. as well as us and our multifamily co-defendants, were denied by the Court and the case is proceeding. Another case with similar allegations has been filed by the District of Columbia against RealPage, Inc. and a number of multifamily owners and/or operators, including us. We believe these various lawsuits are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend against them. As these proceedings are in the early stages, it is not possible for the Company to predict the outcome nor is it possible to estimate the amount of loss, if any, which may be associated with an adverse decision in any of

of total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and is designed as an amenity for our residential residents. The chief operating decision maker evaluates the performance of each property on a consolidated residential and non-residential basis. The Company s geographic consolidated same store operating segments represent its reportable segments. The Company s development activities are other business activities that do not constitute an operating segment and as such, have been aggregated in the Other category in the tables presented below. All revenues are from external customers and there is customer who contributed 10 or more of the Company s total revenues during the nine months and quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The primary financial measure for the Company s rental real estate segment is net operating income NOI ), which represents rental income less: 1) property and maintenance expense and 2) real estate taxes and insurance expense (all as reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income). The Company believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of its operating performance because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the Company s apartment properties. Revenues for all leases are reflected on a straight-line basis in accordance with GAAP for the current and comparable periods.

Note: See Note 12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for detail by reportable segment/market. 
 The increase in same store rental income is primarily driven by good demand and modest supply across most of our markets. 

The increase in year-to-date same store operating expenses is due primarily to: 

Real estate taxes An 8.0 million increase due to escalation in rates and assessed values including an approximately one percentage point contribution to growth from 421-a tax abatement burnoffs in New York City. Once the burnoffs are completed, previously rent-restricted apartment units will transition to market; 

Other on-site operating expenses A 2.6 million increase primarily driven by higher property-related legal expenses; 

Insurance A 2.5 million increase due to higher premiums on property insurance renewal due to conditions in the insurance market that while less difficult than recent years, remain challenging; and 

Utilities A 1.7 million increase primarily driven by higher water, sewer and trash expense, partially offset by lower commodity prices for gas and electric. 

Non-same store/other NOI results consist primarily of properties acquired in calendar years 2023 and 2024, operations from the Company s development properties, other corporate operations and operations prior to disposition from 2023 and 2024 sold properties. 

The increase in consolidated total NOI is primarily a result of the Company s higher NOI from same store properties, largely due to improvement in same store revenues as noted above and the Company's continued focus on same store expense efficiency. 

See the Same Store Results section below for additional discussion of those results. See the reconciliation table of net income per the consolidated statements of operations to NOI above for the dollar and percentage changes related to the comparison discussions provided below. 
 Property management expenses include off-site expenses associated with the self-management of the Company s properties as well as management fees paid to any third-party management companies. The increases during the nine months and quarter ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year periods are primarily attributable to increases in payroll-related costs, information technology expenses and legal and professional fees. 
 General and administrative expenses, which include corporate operating expenses, decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to decreases in payroll-related costs, partially offset by increases in other public company costs. General and administrative expenses increased during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increases in travel costs and other public company expenses. 
 Depreciation expense, which includes depreciation on non-real estate assets, increased during the nine months and quarter ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year periods, primarily as a result of additional depreciation expense on properties acquired in 2023 and 2024 and development properties placed in service during 2023 and 2024, partially offset by lower depreciation from properties sold in 2023 and 2024. 
 Net gain on sales of real estate properties increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period, primarily as a result of the sale of six consolidated apartment properties for a higher gain in 2024 as compared to the sale of eight consolidated apartment properties in the same period in 2023. Net gain on sales of real estate properties decreased during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to a loss on sale of one consolidated apartment property in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to a gain on sale of one consolidated apartment property in the same period in 2023. 
 Interest and other income increased during the nine months and quarter ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year periods, primarily due to a net increase in realized/unrealized gains of 12.6 million and 8.1 million, respectively, on various investment securities as well as short-term investment income on restricted deposit accounts due to a higher rate environment and higher overall invested balances. 
 Other expenses increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increases in litigation accruals and advocacy contributions, partially offset by decreases in data transformation project costs that occurred during 2023 but not during 2024. Other expenses increased during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increases in advocacy contributions.

Table of Contents 

 Interest expense, including amortization of deferred financing costs, increased during the nine months and quarter ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year periods, primarily due to higher overall debt balances outstanding and higher rates on floating debt. The effective interest cost on all indebtedness, excluding debt extinguishment costs/prepayment penalties, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.90 as compared to 3.81 for the prior year period, and for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 3.92 as compared to 3.81 for the prior year period. The Company capitalized interest of approximately 10.7 million and 9.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 3.8 million and 2.6 million during the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Loss from investments in unconsolidated entities increased during the nine months and quarter ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year periods, primarily as a result of losses incurred on our unconsolidated development properties which recently started lease-up activities, partially offset by increases in net income of unconsolidated operating properties and a gain on sale of an unconsolidated operating property. 
 Same Store Results	 
 Properties that the Company owned and were stabilized for all of both of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, which represented 76,916 apartment units, drove the Company s results of operations. Properties are considered stabilized when they have achieved 90 occupancy for three consecutive months.

Note: The above table reflects Residential same store results only. Residential operations account for approximately 96.3 of total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had solid performance in its operating business, with healthy demand across most of our markets supported by a continuing solid job market, high employment levels among our target affluent renter demographic and wage growth across the economy. Competitive new supply has also been modest in most of our existing coastal markets yet has been elevated in our expansion markets. As expected, our East Coast markets continue to be our best performers. On the West Coast, Seattle has continued to show improvement, while San Francisco has improved but at a more modest pace. Our Southern California markets (namely the city of Los Angeles) have shown good demand but greater price sensitivity during the third quarter of 2024. 
 The Company continued to make progress in move-out activity related to delinquent residents during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. While the eviction process remains challenging, we have made additional progress in reducing delinquencies in our portfolio. We expect this trend to continue through the remainder of 2024. 
 We are seeing an increasingly active transaction market providing us with opportunities to acquire properties in our expansion markets. We are excited to grow our portfolio and create operating scale in these markets as we execute on our strategy to better balance our portfolio. 
 Overall, the fundamentals of our business are healthy. Long-term, we expect elevated single family home ownership costs, positive household formation trends, manageable competitive new supply in our established coastal markets and the overall deficit in housing across the country to buffer the impact on our business from the risks of potential economic weakness. We also see our affluent resident base as being resilient to economic uncertainty, including elevated inflation, due to higher levels of disposable income and lower relative rent-to-income ratios. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 With approximately 1.7 billion in readily available liquidity, a strong balance sheet, limited near-term debt maturities, very strong credit metrics and ample access to capital markets, the Company believes it is well positioned to meet its future obligations and take advantage of opportunities. See further discussion below.

The following provides information regarding the Company s cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Operating Activities 
 Our operating cash flows are primarily impacted by NOI and its components, such as Average Rental Rates, Physical Occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our properties. Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period increased by approximately 30.9 million primarily as a result of the NOI and other changes discussed above in Results of Operations . 
 Investing Activities 
 Our investing cash flows are primarily impacted by our transaction activity (acquisitions/dispositions), development spend and capital expenditures. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, key drivers were: 
 Acquired fifteen consolidated rental properties for approximately 1.3 billion; 

Disposed of six consolidated rental properties, receiving net proceeds of approximately 360.9 million; 

Invested 90.7 million primarily in consolidated development projects; 

Invested 230.1 million in capital expenditures to real estate; and 

Invested 79.6 million primarily in unconsolidated development joint venture entities as well as unconsolidated investments in real estate technology funds/companies for various technology initiatives. 

Financing Activities 
 Our financing cash flows primarily relate to our borrowing activity (debt proceeds or repayment), distributions/dividends to shareholders/unitholders and other Common Share activity. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, key drivers were: 
 Issued Common Shares related to share option exercises and ESPP purchases and received net proceeds of 20.1 million; 

Paid dividends/distributions on Common Shares, Preferred Shares, Units (including OP Units and restricted units) and noncontrolling interests in partially owned properties totaling approximately 791.2 million; 

Repurchased and retired 652,452 Common Shares, at a weighted average purchase price of 58.95 per share, for an aggregate purchased amount of approximately 38.5 million. See Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion; 

Repurchased and retired 402,500 Series K Preferred Shares/Preference Units with a liquidation value of approximately 20.1 million for total cash consideration of approximately 21.8 million, inclusive of premiums and accrued dividends through the redemption date. See Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion; and 

Issued 600.0 million of ten-year 4.65 unsecured notes, receiving net proceeds of approximately 598.0 million before underwriting fees, hedge termination costs and other expenses. The proceeds from this issuance were used to partially fund the Company s acquisition activity during the third quarter of 2024.

 Short-Term Liquidity and Cash Proceeds 
 The Company generally expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements, including capital expenditures related to maintaining its existing properties and scheduled unsecured note and mortgage note repayments, through its working capital, net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under the Company s revolving credit facility and commercial paper program. Currently, the Company considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payments of distributions. 
 The following table presents the Company s balances for cash and cash equivalents, restricted deposits and the available borrowing capacity on its revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (amounts in thousands):

Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Program 
 The Company has a 2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility maturing October 26, 2027. The Company has the ability to increase available borrowings by an additional 750.0 million by adding lenders to the facility, obtaining the agreement of existing lenders to increase their commitments or incurring one or more term loans. The interest rate on advances under the facility will generally be the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus a spread (currently 0.715 ), or based on bids received from the lending group, and the Company pays an annual facility fee (currently 0.125 ). Both the spread and the facility fee are dependent on the Company s senior unsecured credit rating and other terms and conditions per the agreement. See Note 8 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of the Company s credit facility. 
 The Company may borrow up to a maximum of 1.0 billion under its commercial paper program subject to market conditions. The notes will be sold under customary terms in the United States commercial paper note market and will rank pari passu with all of the Company s other unsecured senior indebtedness. 
 The Company limits its utilization of the revolving credit facility in order to maintain liquidity to support its 1.0 billion commercial paper program along with certain other obligations. The following table presents the availability on the Company s unsecured revolving credit facility as of October 28, 2024 (amounts in thousands):

Dividend Policy 
 The Company declared a dividend/distribution for the first, second and third quarters of 2024 of 0.675 per share/unit in each quarter, an annualized increase of 2.0 over the amount paid in 2023. All future dividends/distributions remain subject to the discretion of the Company s Board of Trustees. 
 Total dividends/distributions paid in October 2024 amounted to 263.4 million (excluding distributions on Partially Owned Properties), which consisted of certain distributions declared during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.

 Long-Term Financing and Capital Needs 
 The Company expects to meet its long-term liquidity requirements, such as lump sum unsecured note and mortgage debt maturities, property acquisitions and financing of development activities, through the issuance of secured and unsecured debt and equity securities (including additional OP Units), proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties and joint ventures, along with cash generated from operations after all distributions. The Company has a significant number of unencumbered properties available to secure additional mortgage borrowings should unsecured capital be unavailable or the cost of alternative sources of capital be too high. The value of and cash flow from these unencumbered properties are in excess of the requirements the Company must maintain in order to comply with covenants under its unsecured notes and line of credit. Of the 30.1 billion in investment in real estate on the Company s balance sheet at September 30, 2024, 26.9 billion or 89.5 was unencumbered. However, there can be no assurances that these sources of capital will be available to the Company in the future on acceptable terms or otherwise. For additional details, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, of the Company s and the Operating Partnership s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 EQR issues equity and guarantees certain debt of the Operating Partnership from time to time. EQR does not have any indebtedness as all debt is incurred by the Operating Partnership.

(1) The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts Nareit defines funds from operations FFO (December 2018 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP )), excluding gains or losses from sales and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate and land when connected to the main business of a REIT, impairment write-downs of investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity and depreciation and amortization related to real estate. Adjustments for partially owned consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. 

(2) Normalized funds from operations Normalized FFO begins with FFO and excludes: 

the impact of any expenses relating to non-operating real estate asset impairment; 
 	 pursuit cost write-offs; 
 	 gains and losses from early debt extinguishment and preferred share/preference unit redemptions; 
 	 gains and losses from non-operating assets; and 
 	 other miscellaneous items.

Table of Contents 

 (3) The Company believes that FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units / Units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company, because they are recognized measures of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses from sales and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate and excluding depreciation related to real estate (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units / Units can help compare the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. The Company also believes that Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units / Units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company because they allow investors to compare the Company s operating performance to its performance in prior reporting periods and to the operating performance of other real estate companies without the effect of items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period and tend to obscure the Company s actual operating results. FFO, FFO available to Common Shares and Units / Units, Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units / Units do not represent net income, net income available to Common Shares / Units or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO, FFO available to Common Shares and Units / Units, Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units / Units should not be exclusively considered as alternatives to net income, net income available to Common Shares / Units or net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company s calculation of FFO, FFO available to Common Shares and Units / Units, Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units / Units may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies. 

(4) FFO available to Common Shares and Units / Units and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units / Units are calculated on a basis consistent with net income available to Common Shares / Units and reflects adjustments to net income for preferred distributions and premiums on redemption of preferred shares/preference units in accordance with GAAP. The equity positions of various individuals and entities that contributed their properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units are collectively referred to as the Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership . Subject to certain restrictions, the Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership may exchange their OP Units for Common Shares on a one-for-one basis. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The Company s and the Operating Partnership s market risk has not changed materially from the amounts and information reported in Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk , to the Company s and the Operating Partnership s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 (b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting: 

There were no changes to the internal control over financial reporting of the Operating Partnership identified in connection with the Operating Partnership s evaluation referred to above that occurred during the third quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Operating Partnership s internal control over financial reporting. 
 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Lega l Proceedings 
 Other than as disclosed below, there have been no changes to the legal proceedings discussed in Part I, Item 3 of the Company's and the Operating Partnership's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Company does not believe there is any litigation pending or threatened against it that, either individually or in the aggregate, may reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company and its financial condition. See Note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 
 The Company is named as a defendant in a class action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California filed in 2016 which alleges that the amount of late fees charged by the Company were improperly determined under California law. The plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages and other relief. On April 8, 2024, the Court issued certain findings of facts and conclusions of law that are adverse to the Company s legal position. At this time, the Company is continuing to defend the action. While the resolution of this matter cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe that the eventual outcome will have a material adverse effect on the Company and its financial condition. 
 Item 1A. R isk Factors 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors that were discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company s and the Operating Partnership s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equi ty Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Unregistered Common Shares Issued in the Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 (Equity Residential) 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, EQR issued 100,888 Common Shares in exchange for 100,888 OP Units held by various limited partners of ERPOP. OP Units are generally exchangeable into Common Shares on a one-for-one basis or, at the option of ERPOP, the cash equivalent thereof, at any time one year after the date of issuance. These shares were either registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), or issued in reliance on an exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as these were transactions by an issuer not involving a public offering. In light of the manner of the sale and information obtained by EQR from the limited partners in connection with these transactions, EQR believes it may rely on these exemptions. 
 Item 3. Defaults Up on Senior Securities 
 None. 
 Item 4. Mine Saf ety Disclosures 
 Not applicable. 
 Item 5. Other Information 
 or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K.
