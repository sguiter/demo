 December 31, 2023 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets Investment in marketable securities Real estate loans held in consolidated CMBS Trust, at fair value Total Liabilities Bonds payable held in consolidated CMBS Trust, at fair value 
 Certain of the Company s assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments, such as when there is evidence of impairment, and therefore such assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The Company reviews its real estate properties for impairment each quarter or when there is an event or change in circumstances that could indicate the carrying amount of the real estate value may not be recoverable. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized of impairment charges related to Heritage Parkway. The impairment was the result of a reduction of the expected hold period, as the Company has agreed to preliminary terms to dispose of the investment. The fair value of such real estate investment at the time of impairment was , and was estimated based on offers for purchase received from independent third parties. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, impairment charges were recognized by the Company. 
 The fair value of the Company's line of credit and mortgage loans payable are determined using Level 2 and Level 3 inputs and a discounted cash flow approach with an interest rate, property valuation and other assumptions that estimate current market conditions. The Company estimated the fair value of the Company's line of credit, exclusive of deferred financing costs, at and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company estimated the fair value of the Company's mortgage loans payable at and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. If the valuation of the Company's properties as of September 30, 2024 were significantly lower, the market interest rate assumption could be higher (due to higher loan-to-value ratios), potentially resulting in a significantly lower estimated fair value for these liabilities. 
 The fair value of the Company's note to affiliate is determined using Level 2 and Level 3 inputs and a discounted cash flow approach with an interest rate and other assumptions that estimate current market conditions. The Company has estimated the fair value of its note to affiliate at approximately and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The estimated market interest rate is impacted by a number of factors. Material changes in those factors may cause a material change to the estimated market interest rate, thereby materially affecting the estimated fair value of the note to affiliate. The Company has estimated the fair value of the note to affiliate in the middle of the range of reasonably estimable values.

 of the Company's combined NAV for all classes of shares as of the last day of the previous calendar quarter. In addition, if redemptions did not reach the limit in a calendar quarter, the unused portion generally would have been carried over to the next quarter and not any subsequent quarter, except that the maximum amount of redemptions during any quarter could never exceed of the combined NAV for all classes of shares as of the last day of the previous calendar quarter. If the quarterly volume limitation was reached on or before the third business day of a calendar quarter, redemption requests during the next quarter would be satisfied on a stockholder by stockholder basis, which the Company refers to as a per stockholder allocation, instead of a first-come, first-served basis. Pursuant to the per stockholder allocation, each stockholder would be allowed to request redemption at any time during such quarter of a total number of shares not to exceed of the shares of common stock the stockholder held as of the end of the prior quarter. 
 
 On December 9, 2022, the Company's board of directors modified the Former SRP to limit redemptions during the three months ended December 31, 2022 to of the Company's combined NAV as of September 30, 2022. During the fourth quarter of 2022, each quarter of 2023, and the first quarter of 2024, the Company received share redemption requests in excess of of its combined NAV as of the last day of the immediately previous quarter. For these six quarters, the applicable quarterly redemption volume limitation was reached on December 19, 2022, February 23, 2023, April 25, 2023, July 24, 2023, October 9, 2023 and January 4, 2024, respectively. Pursuant to the terms of the Former SRP, all redemption requests received during a calendar quarter prior to such dates were satisfied on a first-come, first-served basis. Redemptions received on these dates were satisfied on a pro rata basis at , , , , and of the requested amount, without regard to share class. As a result of reaching the quarterly redemption volume limitation during these quarters, the Company did not accept any redemption requests during the applicable quarter following the date on which such limitation was reached. Stockholders who wished to request redemption of any unfulfilled requests were required to resubmit their redemption requests beginning on the first calendar day of the following quarter. 
 
 Pursuant to the terms of the Former SRP, because the quarterly redemption volume limitation for the first quarter of 2024 was reached on the third business day of such quarter, redemption requests received during the quarter ending June 30, 2024 were satisfied in accordance with the per stockholder allocation as described above. 
 
 On June 21, 2024, the Company's board of directors amended and restated the Company's share redemption plan, effective July 1, 2024 (the "New SRP"). Pursuant to the New SRP, stockholders of the Company may request, on a monthly basis, that the Company redeem all or any portion of their shares of common stock, provided that such redemptions (i) will be effected at a redemption price (the Redemption Price equal to the NAV per share for such applicable class of shares as of a date (the Redemption Pricing Date that is at least business days before their redemption (the Redemption Date and (ii) will be limited to no more than of the Company s combined NAV per month and no more than of the Company s combined NAV per calendar quarter, with the Company s combined NAV for each limit to be calculated as of the last calendar day of the prior quarter. After the close of business on the Redemption Pricing Date, and in any event no later than the opening of business on the immediately following business day, the Company will post the Redemption Price for each class of shares of common stock on its website. In the event that there is a material change in the NAV per share between the Redemption Pricing Date and the Redemption Date, the Company may determine that the previously-disclosed Redemption Price is no longer appropriate. If the Redemption Price for the applicable month is not made available by the tenth business day prior to the last business day of the month (or is changed after such date), then no redemption requests will be accepted for such month and stockholders who wish to have their shares redeemed the following month must resubmit their redemption requests.

Minimum account redemptions will apply even in the event that the failure to meet the minimum balance is caused solely by a decline in the Company's NAV.

 The Company's board of directors has the discretion to suspend or modify the New SRP at any time, including in circumstances in which it (1) determines that such action is in the best interest of the Company's stockholders, (2) determines that it is necessary due to regulatory changes or changes in law or (3) becomes aware of undisclosed material information that it believes should be publicly disclosed before shares are redeemed. In addition, the Company's board of directors may suspend the Offerings and the redemption plan, if it determines that the calculation of NAV is materially incorrect or there is a condition that restricts the valuation of a material portion of the Company's assets. 
 
 Equity-Based Compensation 
 
 The Company has in place an incentive compensation plan and an independent directors compensation plan (the Compensation Plans ). The Compensation Plans were created to attract, retain and compensate highly-qualified individuals, who are not employees of RREEF Property Trust, Inc. or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, for service as members of the board by providing them with competitive compensation. 
 
 Pursuant to the independent directors compensation plan, upon completion of each annual stockholder meeting, the Company grants shares of restricted Class D common stock to each of the Company's independent directors (the "Annual Share Grant Awards"). The fair value of the Annual Share Grant Awards will be determined using the Company s share price for the class of shares granted on the date of grant. The Annual Share Grant Awards shall vest and become non-forfeitable at the next annual stockholder meeting (approximately from issue date). The Company has elected to account for any forfeitures of restricted stock awards as they occur.

 Overview 
 
 We are a Maryland corporation formed on February 7, 2012, our inception date, to invest in a diversified portfolio of high-quality, income-producing commercial real estate properties and other real estate-related assets. We are an externally advised, perpetual-life corporation that initially elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the calendar year ended December 31, 2013. We invest primarily in the office, industrial, retail and residential sectors of the commercial real estate industry in the United States and may also invest in the self-storage sector. We also invest in real estate-related assets, which include common and preferred stock of publicly-traded REITs and other real estate companies, which we refer to as real estate equity securities, and debt investments backed by real estate, which we refer to as real estate loans. We hold our properties, real estate-related assets and other investments through RREEF Property Operating Partnership, LP, or our operating partnership, of which we are the sole general partner. 
 
 Our board of directors has ultimate oversight and policy-making authority over us, including responsibility for governance, financial controls, compliance and disclosure. Pursuant to our advisory agreement, our board of directors has delegated to RREEF America L.L.C., or our advisor, authority to manage our day-to-day business in accordance with our investment objectives, strategy, guidelines, policies and limitations. Our advisory agreement is renewable annually upon approval by our board of directors, including a majority of our independent directors. The current term expires on August 2, 2025. 
 
 We raise capital through a combination of public and private offerings of our shares of common stock. Our initial public offering commenced on January 3, 2013, through which we raised 102,831 (the "Initial Public Offering"). Our second public offering commenced in July 12, 2016, through which we raised 132,994 (the "Second Public Offering"). Our third public offering commenced on January 8, 2020, through which we raised 149,580 (the "Third Public Offering"). On August 10, 2023, our fourth public offering commenced (the "Fourth Public Offering"). We have registered for sale in our Fourth Public Offering up to 2,000,000 of shares of our common stock to be sold on a "best efforts" basis in any combination of Class A, Class I, Class M-I, Class N, Class S, Class T or Class T2 common stock. 
 
 On January 20, 2016, we launched a private offering of up to a maximum of 350,000 of our Class D shares (the Reg D Private Placement ). The Reg D Private Placement is being conducted pursuant to Rule 506(c) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. 
 
 On November 17, 2020, we commenced a separate private offering of up to a maximum of 300,000 in Class D shares under Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act (the "Reg S Private Placement" and, together with the Reg D Private Placement, the "Private Placements"). We refer to the Initial Public Offering, Second Public Offering, Third Public Offering, Fourth Public Offering and the Private Placements collectively as our offerings. 
 
 The per share purchase price of our common stock varies from day-to-day, and on any given business day, for a given share class, is equal to our NAV of such share class divided by the number of shares of our common stock outstanding for such share class as of the end of business on such day, plus, for Class A, Class D, Class S and Class T2 shares only, applicable selling commissions and dealer manager fees. 
 
 We are structured as a perpetual-life, non-exchange traded REIT. This means that, subject to regulatory approval of our filing for additional offerings, we intend to sell shares of our common stock on a continuous basis and for an indefinite period of time. We will endeavor to take all reasonable actions to avoid interruptions in the continuous public offering of our shares of common stock. There can be no assurance, however, that we will not need to suspend our continuous public offering. The public offering must be registered in every state in which we offer or sell shares. Generally, such registrations are for a period of one year. Thus, we may have to stop selling shares in any state in which our registration is not renewed or otherwise extended annually. We reserve the right to terminate the Fourth Public Offering at any time.

 Real Estate Property Portfolio 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we owned 13 properties diversified across geography and sector. Excluding our residential properties with leases that roll over approximately every year, as of September 30, 2024, our weighted average remaining lease term for active leases was 3.4 years. The following table sets forth certain additional information about the properties we owned as of September 30, 2024:

 Real Estate Equity Securities Portfolio 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our real estate equity securities portfolio consisted of publicly-traded common stock of 29 REITs with a value of 129 allocated across multiple property type sectors. We believe that investing a portion of our proceeds from our offerings into a diversified portfolio of common and preferred shares of REITs and other real estate operating companies will provide the overall portfolio some flexibility with near-term liquidity as well as potentially enhance our NAV over a longer period. Our real estate equity securities portfolio is regularly reviewed 
 46 

Table of Contents 

 and evaluated to determine whether the securities held continue to serve their original intended purposes. 
 
 From our inception until the first quarter of 2023, we have invested in a portfolio of publicly-traded REIT securities to potentially enhance performance of the overall portfolio while also providing a source of liquidity available to fund redemptions or other needs. During the first quarter of 2023, in considering the then-current market volatility as well as higher liquidity demands across the non-listed REIT industry in general, we took advantage of a temporary rise in publicly-traded REIT security values and converted nearly all of our securities portfolio into cash. This resulted in a net realized gain to us of approximately 3,472. Our strategy to invest in a real estate securities portfolio has not changed and we will look to increase our allocation to real estate securities as conditions improve. 
 
 Real Estate Loan Portfolio 
 
 In October 2022, we purchased all of the Class D certificates and certain interest-only certificates of CMBS securitized through a trust (the CMBS Trust sponsored by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac") for a total investment of 30,855, excluding closing costs and the net accrued interest receivable. The Class D certificates represent the most subordinate tranche of the CMBS Trust issued through Freddie Mac's K-Series program. The Class D certificates are a zero-coupon investment with a term of nearly ten years that was purchased at a significant discount to its par value. 
 
 The Class D certificates contain certain rights which under GAAP are considered the controlling class because they provide the owner with the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the performance of the CMBS Trust. As a result, we were required to consolidate the CMBS Trust. In addition, we elected the fair value option under GAAP and thus reported all the assets of the CMBS Trust as real estate loans held in consolidated CMBS Trust at fair value, and we reported bonds payable held in consolidated CMBS Trust at the fair value of all the certificates that we did not own. However, the amount of such liability and their related assets can only be satisfied through the cash flows from the underlying loans which are managed and disbursed directly to the other certificate holders by the administrator of the CMBS Trust. Accordingly, we did not have any rights to those receivables from, nor any obligation to, those other certificate holders. The net difference between the above referenced amounts represented the amount of our actual investment. 
 
 In February and March 2024, we sold our investments in the interest-only certificates issued by the CMBS Trust for approximately 7,588, excluding accrued interest. The sale of the interest-only certificates did not affect the accounting treatment described in the previous paragraph. 
 
 In July 2024, we sold our entire investment in the Class D certificates issued by the CMBS Trust for approximately 25,588. After this sale, we do not own any securities issued by the CMBS Trust. 
 
 Market Outlook 
 
 Commercial Real estate values have gradually increased since the beginning of 2024, according to the General Services Administration in September 2024. The recovery is subject to capital markets changes, but we believe that the balance of risks tilts toward lower, not higher, interest rates. The core Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) index increased 2.7 (year-over-year) in August 2024, as reported by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, but excluding housing, which we believe is a lagging component, it increased 2.2 year-over-year, allowing the Federal Reserve to cut its policy rate by 50 basis points in September 2024. 
 
 The Federal Reserve s quarterly Summary of Economic Projections in September 2024 suggests that it will continue to reduce short-term interest rates until such rates fall below 3.0 . We believe that long-term rates will not drop as much as short-term rates, not least because the yield curve remains relatively flat, as noted by the Federal Reserve in September 2024. However, according to DWS and the Federal Reserve, history shows a strong (0.9) correlation between long- and short-term rates, implying that directionally, the former will come down as well. Lower long-term yields could compress capitalization rates, supporting real estate values.

 We believe that real estate is positioned to deliver competitive returns regardless. The combination of falling real estate values prior to 2024 and resilient net operating incomes (NOI) has lifted income returns to their highest levels in nearly a decade, according to the National Council of Real Estate Fiduciaries (NCREIF) in September 2024. Moreover, we believe that the outlook for rent growth is increasingly bright. 
 
 In our view, fundamentals have softened since mid-2022. In part, the slowdown, as evidenced in the NCREIF data from September 2024, reflects a reset from the pandemic, when, according to CBRE s Economic Analysis (CBRE-EA) in September 2024, e-commerce and social distancing fueled booming demand in the industrial and residential sectors. Also according to CBRE-EA in March 2024, residential absorption has since rebounded, as evidenced by absorption in the first three quarters of 2024 being the second-strongest since 2000 (after the COVID bounce in 2021), a pattern that in our view will be repeated in the industrial sector. Thereafter, we believe that structural forces, including housing shortages for the residential sector and e-commerce for the industrial sector, will propel demand. 
 
 A larger factor has been a wave of development triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic demand surge, according to CBRE-EA in September 2024, when industrial and residential supply reached record levels in 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. However, based on sector weights from NCREIF in September 2024, Costar data shows construction starts have dropped 70 from their 2022 peak, pointing to a sharp reduction in deliveries in 2025. As demand revives from the lows associated with the COVID-19 pandemic into an emerging supply void, we believe that fundamentals will strengthen materially, supporting rental growth averaging 3 to 4 annually over several years (more in the industrial sector, less in the office sector). 
 
 In our view, elevated yields and robust rent growth prospects are launching a new cycle, one driven by cash flows rather than capitalization rate compression, which is unsustainable in perpetuity. We believe capitalization rates could fall too, and we believe investors should position for that eventuality. Regardless, we believe that the ingredients are in place for a rewarding real estate recovery. 

Results of Operations 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we owned 13 properties, a small portfolio of real estate equity securities and no real estate loan investments as described above under "Portfolio Information." We expect to continue to raise additional capital, increase our borrowings and make future investments in our targeted segments of real estate properties, real estate equity securities and real estate loans, which we believe will have a significant impact on our future results of operations. 
 
 The following table illustrates the changes in our income statement components for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Property Related Income 
 
 Our property related income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased compared to the 2023 period primarily due to the disposition of the Anaheim Hills Office Plaza on September 6, 2023. Our property related income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased compared to the 2023 period primarily due to the dispositions of the Allied Drive property on June 26, 2023 and Anaheim Hills Office Plaza on September 6, 2023, and the 2023 Bed, Bath Beyond early lease termination, which required us to fully recognize the remaining unamortized below market lease intangible of 2,342 . These decreases were partially offset by the 2024 Allstate Insurance Company early lease termination for which we recognized 2,400 in termination income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 
 Interest Income 
 
 Our interest income is generated from automated, overnight sweeps of cash to an interest-bearing account.

Investment Income on Marketable Securities 
 
 Since our inception, we have invested in a portfolio of publicly-traded REIT securities to potentially enhance performance of the overall portfolio while also providing a source of liquidity available to fund redemptions or other needs. In considering then-current market volatility as well as higher liquidity demands across the non-listed REIT industry in general, during the first quarter of 2023 we took advantage of a temporary rise in publicly-traded REIT security values and converted nearly all of our securities portfolio into cash. This resulted in lower investment income f or the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 period . Our strategy to invest in a real estate securities portfolio has not changed and we will look to increase our allocation to real estate securities as broader equity market conditions improve. 
 
 General and Administrative 
 
 Our general and administrative expenses include a variety of corporate expenses, the largest of which f or the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were directors and officers insurance, audit fees and legal costs. Compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the 2024 periods saw higher legal, income tax, tax consulting, and independent director compensation. 
 
 Property Operating Expenses 
 
 Property operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased from the 2023 period due to higher utility costs at one property which more than offset the decrease in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period caused by the sale of Anaheim Hills Office Plaza on September 6, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, property operating expenses decreased from the same period in 2023 due to the dispositions of Allied Drive on June 26, 2023 and Anaheim Hills Office Plaza on September 6, 2023, which was partially offset by higher costs at several properties generally for insurance, professional fees, legal, utilities and snow removal. 
 
 Advisory Fees 
 
 The fixed component of the advisory fee pursuant to the advisory agreement is equal to 1 per annum of the NAV for each share class and is calculated and accrued daily and reflected in our NAV per share. The fixed component of the advisory fee was lower in the 2024 periods compared to the 2023 periods which is commensurate with the overall decrease in our average NAV due to higher share redemptions as well as property valuation declines. 
 
 In accordance with our advisory agreement, our advisor can earn the performance component of the advisory fee when the total return to stockholders of a particular share class exceeds a required per annum hurdle for such share class (the Hurdle Amount ). The performance component is calculated separately for each share class and is comprised of the distributions paid to stockholders in each share class combined with the change in the price per share of each share class. For any calendar year in which the total return per share allocable to a class exceeds the Hurdle Amount for such class, RREEF America will receive a percentage of the aggregate total return allocable to such class. The performance component of the advisory fee is payable annually based on the results for the entire calendar year. The actual performance component that our advisor could earn in the current calendar year depends on several factors, including but not limited to the performance of our investments, our expenses and interest rates. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the performance fees did not meet the criteria for accrual in accordance with GAAP, resulting in no performance component of the advisory fee. 
 
 Provision for Impairment of Real Estate 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, in accordance with authoritative guidance for impairment of long-lived assets, we determined that Heritage Parkway was impaired as the carrying value of the investment was not deemed recoverable due to a reduction of the expected hold period. Therefore, we recognized an impairment charge totaling 2,201 for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Table of Contents 

Depreciation and Amortization 
 
 Depreciation and amortization decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to the dispositions of Allied Drive on June 26, 2023 and Anaheim Hills Office Plaza on September 6, 2023. Additionally for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, amortization declined significantly from the same period in 2023 due to the 2023 recognition of 897 of remaining unamortized acquired intangible assets at Terra Nova Plaza due to the termination of the lease for Bed, Bath Beyond. 
 
 Sale of Real Estate 
 
 On January 12, 2023, we sold a small portion of land and granted an easement over land to a state authority with a combined total area of approximately 0.4 acres from The Flats at Carrs Hill property for approximately 657, resulting in a net realized gain of 542. 
 
 On June 26, 2023, we sold the Allied Drive property for 41,900, resulting in a net realized gain of 15,426. 
 
 On September 6, 2023, we sold our Anaheim Hills Office Plaza property for 18,000, resulting in a net realized gain of 2,012. 
 
 Marketable Securities 
 
 Historically, we have invested in a portfolio of publicly-traded REIT securities to potentially enhance performance of the overall portfolio while also providing a source of liquidity available to fund redemptions or other needs. In considering then-current market volatility as well as higher liquidity demands across the non-listed REIT industry in general, during the first quarter of 2023 we took advantage of a temporary rise in publicly-traded REIT security values and converted nearly all of our securities portfolio into cash. This resulted in a net realized gain to us of approximately 3,472. Thereafter, due to the reduced size of our portfolio of investments in publicly-traded REIT securities, the securities portfolio is rebalanced on a less frequent basis, resulting in a much lower net realized gain or loss occurring after the date of selling most of the securities portfolio. 
 
 Gain Upon Partial Sale of Investment in CMBS Trust 
 
 In February and March of 2024, we sold our investments in the interest-only certificates issued by the CMBS Trust, resulting in net realized gains of 465 . 
 
 In July 2024, we sold our investment in the principal-only certificates issued by the CMBS Trust, resulting in net realized gains of 1,856. 
 
 Changes in Net Assets of CMBS Trust 
 
 In October 2022, we purchased an investment in CMBS securities issued through the CMBS Trust. Under GAAP, we were required to consolidate the entire CMBS Trust, because we had the power to direct certain activities of the CMBS Trust that could most significantly impact the overall performance of the CMBS Trust. In connection therewith, we elected to fair value the securities issued by the CMBS Trust. Further, we elected to present interest income and interest expense from the consolidated activities of the CMBS Trust, along with any unrealized gain or loss in fair value of our investment in the CMBS Trust, together as a single line item as changes in net assets of the consolidated CMBS Trust. On July 18, 2024, we sold our entire investment in the Class D certificates issued by the CMBS Trust for 25,588 in a transaction with an unaffiliated third party, resulting in converting the net unrealized gain into a net realized gain. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 
 The higher interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 period was 
 51 

Table of Contents 

 primarily due to a higher weighted average outstanding balance on the Wells Fargo Line of Credit, along with a slightly higher weighted average interest rate of 7.6 compared to 7.1 for the 2023 period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the higher interest expense compared to the 2023 period was primarily due to a higher weighted average interest rate on the Wells Fargo Line of Credit of 7.6 compared to 6.8 for the 2023 period, partially offset by a slightly lower weighted average outstanding balance. Our total outstanding loan balance as of September 30, 2024 consisted of 74 fixed rate loans and 26 floating rate loans. 
 
 We expect our interest expense to increase in future periods because we anticipate acquiring additional properties or making real estate debt investments with borrowings, including by utilizing additional property-specific debt as a form of permanent financing along with continuing to use the Wells Fargo Line of Credit. Interest rates available for both fixed and floating rate financing of property acquisitions have increased significantly over the past two years in response to higher U.S. Treasury rates, higher inflation, recent bank failures, war and concerns over a potential coming recession. Consequently, higher interest rates will cause us to incur higher interest costs on our floating rate line of credit, and may reduce the availability of reasonable financing rates relative to yields on property investments. 

Inflation 
 
 The increase in inflation since mid-2021 as evidenced by the consumer price index, and the extent to which it continues, may have an impact on our property operating expenses. While inflation has more recently declined, when the economy will see a reduction of inflation to historical averages remains subject to countless economic, regulatory and population driven variables. 
 
 With the exception of leases with tenants in residential properties, we seek to include provisions in our tenant leases designed to protect us from the impact of inflation. These provisions include annual contractual base rent increases, reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements, or in some cases, annual reimbursement of operating expenses above a certain allowance. Notwithstanding these provisions, periods of excessive or prolonged inflation and higher interest rates may negatively impact our tenants businesses, resulting in increased vacancy, concessions or bad debt expense, which may adversely and materially affect our net operating income and NAV. Due to the generally long-term nature of our commercial leases, and inflation since the second quarter of 2021, contractual annual rent increases have not, and may not in the future, be sufficient to cover inflation and may result in rental rates that are below market. Leases in residential properties generally expire on an annual basis and do not typically present the same concerns regarding inflation protection due to their short-term nature and our ability to increase rents in an attempt to keep up with inflation. 
 
 In addition, prices for certain construction materials have risen significantly over the past year. While we have incurred typical ongoing capital expenditures for property improvements and maintenance, such costs have been relatively immaterial to date. We currently have one development project ongoing at Commerce Corner, which commenced in October 2023 and is estimated to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2024. Such project is subject to a guaranteed maximum price construction contract that eliminates the risk of additional increases in the cost of certain materials and labor. Future significant capital projects may be impacted by increased material and/or labor costs. 
 
 NAV per Share 
 
 Our NAV per share is calculated by The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation ("BNY") in accordance with the valuation guidelines approved by our board of directors for the purposes of establishing a purchase price for our shares sold in our offerings as well as establishing a redemption price for our share repurchase plan. Our advisor is responsible for overseeing, and is ultimately responsible for, the calculation of our NAV and our NAV per share as performed by BNY. 
 
 Each class of our common stock has an undivided interest in our assets and liabilities, other than class-specific liabilities. In accordance with the valuation guidelines, BNY calculates our NAV per share for each class after the 
 52 

Table of Contents 

 end of each business day, using a process that reflects several components, including, but not limited to, (1) estimated values of each of our properties based upon individual appraisal reports provided periodically by our independent valuation advisor and other third-party independent valuation firms, (2) the value of our liquid assets for which third party market quotes are available, (3) estimated values of our other real estate equity securities and non-held-to-maturity real estate loan investments, as provided by independent valuation agents, and (4) estimated accruals and amortizations of our operating revenues and expenses, including our organization and offering expenses. No rule or regulation requires that we calculate NAV in a certain way. While we believe our NAV calculation methodologies are consistent with standard industry principles, there is no established practice among public REITs, whether listed or not, for calculating NAV in order to establish a purchase or redemption price. As a result, other public REITs may use different methodologies or assumptions to determine NAV. 
 
 At the end of each business day, before taking into consideration additional issuances of shares of capital stock, redemptions or class-specific fee accruals for that day, any change in our aggregate NAV (whether an increase or decrease) is allocated among each class of shares based on each class s relative percentage of the previous aggregate NAV. Changes in our daily NAV will include, without limitation and as applicable, daily accruals and amortizations of our net portfolio income, interest expense, unrealized/realized gains and losses on assets, offering costs and any expense reimbursements. Costs incurred by us under the expense support agreement will be allocated to all classes of shares of our common stock on a pro rata basis as and when such amounts are reimbursed to our advisor. In addition, offering costs associated with all of our offerings (including any private offerings) will be allocated to all classes, on a pro rata basis. The net portfolio income will be calculated and accrued on the basis of data extracted from (1) the monthly budget for each property and at the company level, including organization and offering expenses and certain operating expenses, (2) interest accruals and premium or discount amortization on real estate loans, (3) material, unbudgeted non-recurring income and expense events such as capital expenditures, prepayment penalties, assumption fees, tenant buyouts, lease termination fees and tenant turnover with respect to our properties when our advisor becomes aware of such events and the relevant information is available, (4) material investment acquisitions and dispositions occurring during the month and (5) reports from other vendors impacting our aggregate NAV. Acquisition costs with respect to each acquired property are amortized on a daily basis into our NAV over a five-year period following the acquisition date. Costs of purchasing or originating real estate loan investments will be amortized over the term of the investment. On an ongoing basis, BNY will adjust the accruals to reflect actual operating results and the outstanding receivable, payable and other account balances resulting from the accumulation of daily accruals for which financial information is available. 
 
 Prior to the initiation of our current follow-on offering period, and prior to initiation of future follow-on offering periods, we have incurred and will incur certain costs in preparation for such follow-on offering periods, which we refer to as prepaid offering costs. Such costs will benefit the entire follow-on offering period to which they relate and as such will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the anticipated follow-on offering period into the NAV for each class of shares beginning upon commencement of each particular follow-on offering. Organization and offering costs incurred during an active follow-on offering period will be deducted from our NAV on an accrual basis as they are incurred. In the event our advisor agrees to pay some or all of our organization and offering costs prior to the commencement of an offering period and agrees to defer reimbursement of such costs, then such costs will be amortized into the daily NAV calculation as such costs are reimbursed to our advisor. We will allocate all of our offering costs to all outstanding shares of all classes on a pro rata basis, each day that we calculate a NAV for a given class of shares. Similarly, any payments made by our dealer manager of reimbursable offering costs in connection with our offerings on our behalf will also be recognized and reflected in our daily NAV for all share classes on a pro rata basis. 
 
 Following the aggregation of the net asset values of our investments, the addition of any other assets (such as cash on hand), the deduction of any other liabilities and the allocation of income and expenses, BNY will incorporate any class-specific adjustments to our NAV, including additional issuances and redemptions of our common stock and accruals of class-specific fees such as distribution fees. Our share classes may have different fee accruals associated with the advisory fee we will pay our advisor because the performance component of our advisory fee is calculated separately with respect to each class. At the close of business on the date that is one business day after each record date for any declared distribution, which we refer to as the distribution adjustment date, our NAV for each class will be reduced to reflect the accrual of our liability to pay the distribution to our

 stockholders of record of each class as of the record date. NAV per share for each class is calculated by dividing such class s NAV at the end of each trading day by the number of shares outstanding for that class on such day.

(1) Our investments in real estate are included at fair value as determined by our advisor based on appraisals completed by our independent valuation advisor or another independent third-party appraiser. Although our independent valuation advisor performs the majority of the valuations, our valuation guidelines require that on a rotating basis, approximately 1/12th of our properties in any particular month must be appraised by one or more independent third-party appraisers who are not affiliated with us, our advisor or our independent valuation advisor. Newly acquired, consolidated properties are initially valued at cost and thereafter join the daily valuation process during the first full quarter in which we own the property. On an ongoing basis, our advisor monitors our properties for events that our advisor believes may be expected to have a material impact on the most recent estimated values provided by our independent appraisers, and notifies our independent valuation advisor of such events, if any. If, on any given day, in the opinion of our independent valuation advisor, an event identified by our advisor, or an event that becomes known to our independent valuation advisor through other means, is likely to have a material impact on previously provided estimated values of the affected properties, our independent valuation advisor will prepare a revised valuation for such properties. As of September 30, 2024, the value of our investments in real estate was approximately 7.8 more than their historical cost. 
 
 (2) As of September 30, 2024, our investments in real estate equity securities consisted entirely of common stock of publicly traded REITs, which are included in our NAV at fair value based on publicly available pricing information provided by third parties. The value of our investments in real estate equity securities was approximately 48.1 more than their historical cost. 
 
 (3) Other assets and other liabilities include normal operating items such as cash, restricted cash, accounts receivable, prepaids, accounts payable and due to affiliates, and other accrued liabilities. Each of these are valued at their current carry value as they are typically short term in nature. 
 
 (4) Our line of credit is valued at cost. Any other debt obligations originated by us will be valued at amortized cost, while any debt obligations assumed by us in connection with a transaction will be valued at the time of assumption pursuant to the purchase price allocation as required by GAAP. Thereafter, assumed debt will not be revalued but rather the discount or premium that resulted from the purchase price allocation will be amortized over the remaining term of the instrument. Liabilities allocable to a specific class of shares will only be included in the NAV calculation for that class. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, all properties were appraised by a third-party appraisal firm in addition to our

 independent valuation advisor. Set forth below are the weighted averages of the key assumptions used in the appraisals of the properties by type as of September 30, 2024. 
 Discount Rate Exit Capitalization Rate Office properties 10.00 8.59 Retail properties 7.66 6.57 Industrial properties 7.25 5.64 Residential properties 6.83 5.58 
 
 These assumptions are determined by our independent valuation advisor or by separate third-party appraisers. A change in these assumptions would impact the calculation of the value of our property investments. The table below shows the approximate decrease in the value of our property investments assuming an increase of 0.25 in the weighted-average discount rate or the weighted-average exit capitalization rate as of September 30, 2024.

(1) Our investments in real estate are presented under historical cost in our GAAP consolidated financial statements. As such, any increases in the fair value of our investments in real estate are not included in our GAAP results. For purposes of determining our NAV, our investments in real estate are recorded at fair value. 
 
 55 

Table of Contents 

 (2) Recording of depreciation and amortization are required under GAAP for historical cost financial statements. Because we include our investments in real estate at fair value when determining our NAV, the accumulated depreciation and amortization recorded under GAAP are eliminated for purposes of determining our NAV. 
 
 (3) The deferred costs and expenses of 22,064 include amounts that have been accrued as a liability under GAAP but are initially excluded from the NAV calculation. The deferred costs and expenses include 17,269 in estimated future trailing fees that will be deducted from the NAV on a daily basis as and when they become payable to DWS Distributors, Inc., or the dealer manager. Additionally, the deferred costs and expenses include 5,054 payable to our advisor which is reflected in due to affiliates and note to affiliate on our consolidated balance sheet but is not yet payable and will be deducted from the NAV as and when they are reimbursed to our advisor in accordance with the advisory agreement, the expense support agreement and the ESA letter agreement dated March 24, 2020 amending the advisory agreement and expense support agreement. Lastly, the deferred cost and expenses above is net of the difference in recognition between GAAP and our NAV calculation for (i) certain offering costs and (ii) compensation costs related to the shares granted to our independent directors. 
 
 (4) Under GAAP, rental revenue is recorded on a straight-line basis where the total contractual revenue for a given lease is recognized for the same average amount per month over the lease term. The estimate of fair value for real estate generally does not reflect this straight-line concept and as such, the amount of rent accrued but not yet billed to the tenants (deferred rent receivable) is not considered in determining our NAV. 
 
 Limitations and Risks 
 
 As with any valuation methodology, our methodology is based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that may not be accurate or complete. Different parties with different assumptions and estimates could derive a different NAV per share. Accordingly, with respect to our NAV per share, we can provide no assurance that: 
 
 a stockholder would be able to realize this NAV per share upon attempting to resell his or her shares; 
 we would be able to achieve, for our stockholders, the NAV per share, upon a listing of our shares of common stock on a national securities exchange, selling our real estate portfolio, or merging with another company; or 
 the NAV per share, or the methodologies relied upon to estimate the NAV per share, will be found by any regulatory authority to comply with any regulatory requirements. 
 
 Furthermore, the NAV per share was calculated as of a particular point in time. The NAV per share will fluctuate over time in response to, among other things, global, national or regional events, such as the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, higher interest rates, inflation, changes in real estate market fundamentals, capital markets activities, and attributes specific to the properties and leases within our portfolio. The extent to which these events impact our investments and operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. 

Funds from Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations 
 
 We believe that funds from operations, or FFO, and adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, in combination with net income or loss and cash flows from operating activities, as defined by GAAP, are useful supplemental performance measures that we use to evaluate our operating performance. However, these supplemental, non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss or to cash flows from operating activities, both as determined by GAAP, as an indication of our performance and are not intended to be used as a liquidity measure indicative of cash flow available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. No single measure can provide users of financial information with sufficient information, and only our disclosures read as a whole can be relied upon to adequately portray our financial position, liquidity and results of operations. In addition, other REITs may define FFO and AFFO measures differently and thus choose to treat certain accounting line items in a manner different from us due to differences in investment and operating strategy or for other reasons. 
 
 56 

Table of Contents 

 FFO 
 
 As defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, FFO is a non-GAAP supplemental financial performance measure that excludes certain items such as real estate-related depreciation and amortization and the impact of certain non-recurring items such as impairment write-downs of real estate investments and realized gains and losses on sales of certain real estate assets. We believe FFO is a meaningful supplemental financial performance measure of our operating performance that is useful to investors because depreciation and amortization in accordance with GAAP implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Additionally, impairment write-downs related to a material decline in the value of a real estate investment and realized gains and losses on sales of certain real estate assets (such as real property or real estate related debt investments) generally occur infrequently. As a result, excluding these items from FFO aids our analysis of our ongoing operations. We use FFO as an indication of our operating performance and as a guide to making decisions about future investments. 
 
 AFFO 
 
 We believe that AFFO is a non-GAAP supplemental financial performance measure that is helpful as a measure of ongoing operating performance because it excludes costs that management considers more reflective of investing activities and other non-operating items included in FFO. Compared to FFO, AFFO additionally excludes items such as acquisition-related costs (if expensed in accordance with GAAP), straight-line rent, amortization of above- and below-market lease intangibles and lease incentives, amortization of restricted stock awards, amortization of deferred financing costs, amortization of the discount on the note to affiliate, gains or losses on extinguishment of debt, the net unrealized change in the fair value of our investments in marketable securities and the net unrealized change in the fair value of our investment in the CMBS Trust. Beginning with the second quarter of 2023, we removed the adjustment for the performance fee from the calculation of AFFO. The prior year presentation of AFFO has been revised accordingly. 
 
 We use FFO and AFFO, among other things: (i) to evaluate and compare the potential performance of the portfolio after the acquisition phase is complete, and (ii) as metrics in evaluating our ongoing distribution policy. We believe investors are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analyses and evaluation with these same performance metrics used by us in planning and executing our business strategy. We believe that these performance metrics will assist investors in evaluating the potential performance of the portfolio after the completion of the acquisition phase. However, these supplemental, non-GAAP measures are not necessarily indicative of future performance and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss or to cash flows from operating activities, both as determined by GAAP, and are not intended to be used as a liquidity measure indicative of cash flow available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Neither the SEC, NAREIT, nor any regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments used to calculate AFFO. In the future, the SEC, NAREIT, or a regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the non-listed REIT industry at which point we may adjust our calculation and characterization of AFFO. 
 
 The following unaudited table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) to FFO and AFFO.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our primary needs for liquidity and capital resources are to fund our investments in accordance with our investment strategy and policies, make distributions to our stockholders, redeem shares of our common stock pursuant to our share redemption plan, pay our offering and operating fees and expenses and pay interest on any outstanding indebtedness. 
 
 Over time, we generally intend to fund our cash needs for items, other than asset acquisitions and material capital improvements, from operations. Our cash needs for acquisitions and material capital improvements will be funded primarily from the sale of shares of our common stock in our offerings or from sales of other investments. The amount we may raise in such offerings is uncertain and dependent on a number of factors, including the impact of higher interest rates and the general view of investors toward commercial real estate. We intend to contribute any additional net proceeds from our offerings that are not used or retained to pay the fees and expenses attributable to our operations to our operating partnership. 
 
 We generally intend to maintain sufficient liquidity at all times to satisfy our operational needs and the maximum potential monthly redemptions under our share redemption plan. As of September 30, 2024, among our cash balances, our real estate securities portfolio, and the available borrowing capacity on our Wells Fargo Line of Credit (as defined below), we had liquidity of 27,115. 
 
 We may also satisfy our cash needs for acquisitions and material capital improvements through the assumption or incurrence of debt. On January 27, 2023, we entered into a second amended and restated secured revolving line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ("Wells Fargo"), thereby changing certain terms and provisions, including extending the maturity date to February 28, 2025 (the "Wells Fargo Line of Credit").

Table of Contents 

 On September 1, 2023, we added Commerce Corner to the Wells Fargo Line of Credit thereby adding RPT 1109 Commerce Corner, LLC, as a borrower under the Wells Fargo Line of Credit. 
 
 On September 7, 2023, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of ours entered into a guaranteed maximum price construction contract in connection with the Commerce Expansion. Commerce Corner is a 259,910 rentable square-foot, 100 leased state-of-the-art, multi-tenant warehouse and distribution center which we acquired in 2014. Construction commenced in the fourth quarter of 2023 and substantial completion was reached in October 2024. The Commerce Expansion was being undertaken to accommodate the growth initiatives of Performance Food Group (NYSE: PFGC), who has entered into a 15-year lease with us to take possession of the Commerce Expansion space. Performance Food Group took possession of the Commerce Expansion space in October 2024 and the new lease will expire in October 2039. In connection therewith, Performance Food Group's lease for its existing space at Commerce Corner was similarly extended to be coterminous, bringing Performance Food Group's footprint to approximately 301,000 square feet as of November 1, 2024. Performance Food Group has one five-year extension option exercisable at least 180 days prior to the expiration of the 15-year lease. 
 
 On December 27, 2023, we entered into a third amendment to the Wells Fargo Line of Credit (the "Third Amendment"). The Third Amendment added CIBC Inc. ("CIBC") to the credit facility as an additional lender; increased the maximum commitment amount from 100,000 to 120,000; allocated the maximum commitment amount between the Revolving Commitment and the Construction Commitment (each, as defined under the Wells Fargo Line of Credit); and revised or suspended certain covenants. The maximum commitment amount of 120,000 is bifurcated as follows: 75,600 to the Revolving Commitment and 44,400 to the Construction Commitment. The Revolving Commitment and Construction Commitment will both be allocated 70.83 to Wells Fargo and 29.17 to CIBC. Pursuant to the Third Amendment, the Wells Fargo Line of Credit incurs interest based on the 30-day average of the secured overnight financing rate ("SOFR") plus a spread of 225 basis points. The term was extended from February 28, 2025 to December 27, 2025. We also continue to serve as guarantor to the Wells Fargo Line of Credit. 
 
 For the Revolving Commitment, as of September 30, 2024, the borrowers' maximum borrowing capacity was 48,971, and the borrowers' outstanding balance was 29,824. For the Construction Commitment, as of September 30, 2024, the borrowers' maximum borrowing capacity was 44,400, and the borrowers' outstanding balance was 37,723. The remaining unfunded portion of the Construction Commitment will be used to fully fund the remaining costs of the Commerce Expansion. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average interest rate was 7.60 . 
 
 The Wells Fargo Line of Credit has a current maximum capacity of 120,000, and we have the option to expand the Wells Fargo Line of Credit up to a maximum capacity of 250,000 upon satisfaction of specified conditions. Each requested expansion must be for at least 25,000 and may result in the Wells Fargo Line of Credit being further syndicated. 
 
 At any time, the borrowing capacity under the Wells Fargo Line of Credit for the Revolving Commitment is based on the lesser of (1) an amount equal to 65 of the aggregate value of the properties in the collateral pool as determined by lender appraisals, (2) an amount that results in a minimum debt yield of 9.5 based on the in-place net operating income of the collateral pool as defined or (3) the maximum capacity of the Revolving Commitment. Proceeds from the Revolving Commitment can be used to fund acquisitions, redeem shares pursuant to our share redemption plan and for any other corporate purpose. Proceeds from the Construction Commitment can be used only to fund construction activities related to the Commerce Expansion. 
 
 The Wells Fargo Line of Credit agreement contains customary representations, warranties, borrowing conditions and affirmative, negative and financial covenants, including that there must be at least four properties in the collateral pool at all times, and the collateral pool must also meet specified concentration provisions, unless waived by the lender. Certain concentration covenants are suspended until such time that the number of properties encumbered by the Wells Fargo Line of Credit reaches six. 
 
 In connection with the Commerce Expansion, Commerce Corner will not be included in the borrowing base during the construction period. Upon completion of the Commerce Expansion, we expect that Commerce Corner

 will become a borrowing base property by the end of 2024. In addition, the guarantor must meet tangible net worth hurdles. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. 
 
 Historically, we have entered into property specific mortgage loans to finance the acquisition of certain properties, or refinance certain properties off of the Wells Fargo Line of Credit to increase available borrowing capacity under the Wells Fargo Line of Credit to fund future property acquisitions. The following table presents a summary of the property specific mortgage loans in place as of September 30, 2024. Each of the below mortgage loans has a fixed interest rate for the entire term of the mortgage loan. In addition, each mortgage loan contains provisions allowing for (a) a one-time transfer of the loan to an unaffiliated borrower at the sole discretion of the lender and upon payment of applicable fees, and (b) full prepayment of the mortgage loan within allowable windows subject to payment of applicable penalties, if any.

 Aggregate future principal payments due on the Wells Fargo Line of Credit and mortgage loans payable as of September 30, 2024 are as follows:

 In the future, as our assets increase, it may not be commercially feasible or we may not be able to secure an adequate line of credit to fund acquisitions, redemptions or other needs. Interest rates available for both fixed and floating rate financing of property acquisitions have increased significantly over the past few quarters in response to higher U.S. Treasury rates, higher inflation, recent bank failures, war and concerns over a potential coming recession, as well as other general economic and/or geopolitical conditions. Consequently, higher interest rates will cause us to incur higher interest costs on our floating rate line of credit, and may reduce the availability of reasonable financing rates relative to yields on property investments. Moreover, actual availability of financing capital may be reduced at any given time if the values of our investments decline, such as that which may occur as a result of inflation, higher interest rates or an expected or actual recession. 
 
 Expense Payments by Our Advisor 
 
 Pursuant to the advisory agreement, RREEF America is entitled to reimbursement of certain costs incurred by 
 60 

Table of Contents 

 RREEF America or its affiliates. Costs eligible for reimbursement include most third-party operating expenses, salaries and related costs of its employees who perform services for us (but not those employees for which RREEF America earns a separate fee or those employees who are our executive officers) and travel related costs for its employees who incur such costs on our behalf. We will reimburse our advisor for all expenses paid or incurred by our advisor in connection with the services provided to us, subject to the limitations described below regarding the 2 /25 guidelines as defined in our advisory agreement. As of September 30, 2024, we owed 55 to our advisor for such costs. 
 
 On May 29, 2013, we entered into an expense support agreement with our advisor, which was amended and restated most recently on January 20, 2016, which we refer to as the expense support agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the expense support agreement, our advisor incurred expenses related to our operations which we refer to as expense payments. These expense payments included, without limitation, expenses that are organization and offering costs and operating expenses under the advisory agreement. As of December 31, 2015, our advisor had incurred 9,200 in expense payments, which was the maximum amount of expense payments allowed under the expense support agreement. We have not received any expense support from our advisor under the expense support agreement since January 1, 2016. 
 
 On March 24, 2020, we and our advisor entered into a second letter agreement which superseded the previous letter agreement, which we refer to as the ESA letter agreement. The ESA letter agreement provides, in part, that our obligations to reimburse our advisor for expense payments under the expense support agreement are suspended until the first calendar month following the month in which we have reached 500,000 in offering proceeds from our offerings, which we refer to as the ESA commencement date. Since our inception through September 30, 2024, we raised 462,945 from the sale of shares of our common stock, including proceeds from our dividend reinvestment plan. Pursuant to the ESA letter agreement, our advisor agreed to permanently waive reimbursement of 3,567 of expense payments related to organization and offering costs from our Initial Public Offering. As a result, we currently owe 5,383 to our advisor under the expense support agreement. Beginning the month following the ESA commencement date, we will make monthly reimbursement payments to our advisor in the amount of 250 for the first 12 months and 198 for the second 12 months. In addition, pursuant to the ESA letter agreement, if RREEF America is serving as our advisor at the time that we or our operating partnership undertakes a liquidation, our remaining obligations to reimburse our advisor for the unpaid monthly reimbursements under the expense support agreement shall be waived. 
 
 Limits on Expense Reimbursement 
 
 In all cases, reimbursement payments to our advisor will be subject to reduction as necessary in order to ensure that such reimbursement payment will not cause the aggregate organization and offering costs paid by us for any particular offering to exceed 15 of the gross proceeds from the sale of shares in such offering as of the date of the reimbursement payment, and such reimbursement payment will not adversely affect our ability to maintain our qualification as a REIT for federal tax purposes. 
 
 In addition to the reimbursement limitations for organization and offering costs, we are also limited in the amount of operating expenses that we may reimburse our advisor. Pursuant to our charter, we may reimburse our advisor, at the end of each fiscal quarter, for total operating expenses incurred by our advisor; provided, however, that we may not reimburse our advisor at the end of any fiscal quarter for total operating expenses (as defined in our charter) that, in the four consecutive fiscal quarters then ended, exceed the greater of 2 of our average invested assets or 25 of our net income determined without reduction for any additions to reserves for depreciation, bad debts or other similar non-cash reserves and excluding any gain from the sale of our assets for that period (which we refer to as the 2 /25 guidelines) for such four-quarter period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may reimburse our advisor for expenses in excess of the 2 /25 guidelines if a majority of our independent directors determine that such excess expenses, which we refer to as an excess amount, are justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors. For the four fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2024, our total operating expenses (as defined in our charter) were 5,121, which did not exceed the 2 /25 guidelines. 
 
 Pursuant to the expense support agreement, the amount of the reimbursement payment paid in any calendar 
 61 

Table of Contents 

 quarter will not be aggregated with our cumulative operating expenses for any four consecutive calendar quarters that includes the calendar quarter in which such reimbursement payment is paid, and instead the amount of the unreimbursed expense payments comprising such reimbursement payment will have previously been aggregated with our total operating expenses for the four calendar quarter periods ending with the calendar quarter in which such expense payment was originally incurred, which we refer to as prior 2 /25 periods. If an unreimbursed expense payment incurred during a prior 2 /25 period exceeded the 2 /25 guidelines for such prior 2 /25 period, the amount of such excess will only be reimbursed pursuant to the expense support agreement to the extent that our independent directors previously approved such excess with respect to the applicable prior 2 /25 period. 
 
 We anticipate our offering and operating fees and expenses will include, among other things, the advisory fee that we pay to our advisor, the selling commissions, dealer manager and distribution fees we pay to the dealer manager, legal and audit expenses, federal and state filing fees, printing expenses, transfer agent fees, marketing and distribution expenses and fees related to appraising and managing our properties. We will not have any office or personnel expenses as we do not have any employees. Our advisor will incur certain of these expenses and fees, for which we may reimburse our advisor, subject to certain limitations. Additionally, our advisor may allocate to us out-of-pocket expenses in connection with providing services to us, including our allocable share of our advisor s overhead, such as rent, utilities and personnel costs for personnel who are directly involved in the performance of services to us and are not our executive officers. Furthermore, our dealer manager incurs certain bona fide offering expenses in connection with the distribution of our shares for which we are required to reimburse the dealer manager. Ultimately, total organization and offering costs incurred in a given offering will not exceed 15 of the gross proceeds from such offering. The total organization and offering costs paid by our advisor did not cause us to exceed the 15 limitation as of September 30, 2024 with respect to any of our public offerings. If, in future periods, the total organization and offering costs paid by our advisor and the dealer manager cause us to exceed the 15 limitation with respect to any of our current or prior public offerings, or any subsequent public offering, the excess would not be reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as of the end of such period. In such event, we may become obligated to reimburse all or a portion of this excess as we raise additional proceeds from such public offering. As of September 30, 2024, our total organization and offering costs incurred with respect to our current public offering and any of our prior public offerings did not exceed the 15 limitation for each such offering. 
 
 Other potential future sources of capital include secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders and proceeds from the sale of assets. If necessary, we may use financings or other sources of capital in the event of unforeseen significant capital expenditures. 

Cash Flow Analysis 
 
 Cash flow provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 6,281 while cash flow provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 9,351. The 2024 period was lower than the 2023 period primarily due to property sales in mid 2023, as well as a couple of spaces that were vacant in 2024 but not in 2023. These decreases were partially offset by the recognition of termination income due to the Allstate Insurance Company lease termination at Heritage Parkway, and lower deferred leasing cost payments for new and renewed leases. 
 
 Cash flow provided by investing activities of 14,715 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by the sale of our investment in the CMBS Trust partially offset by improvements to our real estate investments, primarily for construction of the Commerce Expansion. Cash flow provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 86,278, which was driven by the sales of our Allied Drive property in June 2023 and our Anaheim Hills Office Plaza property in September 2023 and the near full liquidation of our securities portfolio. 
 
 Cash flow used in financing activities was 17,588 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We used the proceeds from the sale of our investment in the CMBS trust to make payments against our outstanding balance on the Wells Fargo Line of Credit. We used capital raised in our offerings plus funds borrowed from our Wells Fargo Line of Credit to pay redemptions and costs of the Commerce Expansion. 
 
 62 

Table of Contents 

 Cash flow used in financing activities was 95,412 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily due to proceeds from the sales of our Allied Drive property and our Anaheim Hills Office Plaza property, along with the sale of our securities portfolio and the refinance of the mortgage loan on The Flats at Carrs Hill to reduce the outstanding balances on our Wells Fargo Line of Credit. Additionally, we paid financing costs of 1,540 to amend and extend our Wells Fargo Line of Credit, as well as to refinance the mortgage loan on The Flats at Carrs Hill. We used capital raise in our offerings plus funds borrowed from our Wells Fargo Line of Credit to pay redemptions. 

Distributions 
 
 Our board of directors has authorized and we declared cash distributions for each month which were payable monthly for each share of our common stock outstanding. The table below shows the aggregate declared distribution amount per share for each period presented. Stockholders for each share class will receive a net amount per share that includes a deduction for applicable distribution fees and dealer manager fees. 
 
 Beginning in July 2024, we slightly changed the timing of distribution payments such that the monthly distribution payment is based on a record date occurring after the month in question. Thus, the distributions for the month of July had a record date in, and were paid in, August, the distributions for the month of August had a record date in, and were paid in, September, and the distributions for the month of September had a record date in, and were paid in, October. Consequently, the distributions for the month of September were approximately the same amounts per share for each share class, but are not included in the table below due to the October record date. 
 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 March 31, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2024 Distributions: Declared distribution amount per share, before adjustment for class-specific fees 0.22486 0.22484 0.14991 Distributions paid or payable in cash 1,912 1,954 1,411 5,277 Distributions reinvested 2,010 2,006 1,176 5,192 Distributions declared 3,922 3,960 2,587 10,469 Net cash provided by Operating Activities: 2,701 1,737 1,843 6,281 Funds From Operations: 2,455 3,151 (360) 5,246 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our distributions were covered 60.0 by cash flow from operations and 40.0 by borrowings. We expect that we will continue to pay distributions monthly in arrears. Any distributions not reinvested will be payable in cash, and there can be no assurances regarding the portion of the distributions that will be reinvested. We intend to fund distributions from cash generated by operations. However, we may fund distributions from borrowings under our Wells Fargo Line of Credit, from the proceeds of our offerings or any other source. 
 
 The payment of distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations or FFO may be dilutive to our NAV per share because it may reduce the amount of proceeds available for investment and operations or cause us to incur additional interest expense as a result of borrowed funds.

Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 Our accounting policies have been established to conform with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If management s judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, thus resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. We consider our critical accounting policies to be the policies that relate to the following concepts: 
 
 Real Estate Investments and Lease Intangibles 
 Revenue Recognition 
 
 A complete description of such policies and our considerations is contained in Note 2 ("Summary of Significant Accounting Policies") to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as supplemented by the most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Certain Accounting Pronouncements Effective in the Future 
 
 We refer you to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the potential impact on us from certain accounting pronouncements that become effective in the future, if any. 
 
 REIT Compliance and Income Taxes 
 
 We elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code beginning with the year ended December 31, 2013, and we believe that we have operated in such a manner to continue to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we are required to, among other things, distribute as dividends at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and excluding net capital gains, to our stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of our income and assets. If we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent our income meets certain criteria and we distribute our REIT taxable income to our stockholders. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to (1) certain state and local taxes on our income, property or net worth and (2) federal income and excise taxes on undistributed income, if any income remains undistributed. Many of these requirements are highly technical and complex. We will monitor the business and transactions that may potentially impact our REIT status. If we were to fail to meet these requirements, we could be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We would not be able to deduct distributions paid to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as a REIT. We will also be disqualified for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost unless we are entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 In connection with our Wells Fargo Line of Credit, which has a variable interest rate, we are subject to market risk associated with changes in SOFR. As of September 30, 2024, we had 67,547 outstanding under our Wells Fargo line of credit bearing interest at approximately 7.60 , representing approximately a 58.4 loan-to-cost ratio. At this balance, a change in the interest rate of 0.50 would result in a change in our interest expense of 338 per 
 64 

Table of Contents 

 annum. In the future, we may be exposed to additional market risk associated with interest rate changes as a result of additional short-term debt, such as additional borrowings under our Wells Fargo Line of Credit, and long-term debt, which, in either case, may be used to maintain liquidity, fund capital expenditures and expand our investment portfolio. Market fluctuations in real estate financing may affect the availability and cost of funds needed to expand our investment portfolio. Market fluctuations in real estate financing, macroeconomic events, inflation and interest rates have, and may in the future, affect the availability and cost of funds needed to expand our investment portfolio. In addition, restrictions upon the availability of real estate financing, such as was caused by the COVID-19 pandemic during parts of 2020, or recent bank failures or high interest rates for real estate loans could adversely affect our ability to dispose of real estate in the future. We will seek to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. We intend to manage market risk associated with our variable-rate financing by assessing our interest rate cash flow risk through continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities. We may use derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates on loans secured by our assets. 
 We may be exposed to credit risk, which is the risk that the counterparty will fail to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. If the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty will owe us, which creates credit risk for us. If the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, we will owe the counterparty and, therefore, do not have credit risk. We will seek to minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high-quality counterparties. We are not currently a party to any such derivative contracts. 
 We will be exposed to financial market risk with respect to our marketable securities portfolio. Financial market risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in equity security prices. Our exposure to changes in equity security prices is a result of our investment in these types of securities. Market prices are subject to fluctuation and, therefore, the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the market prices of a security may result from any number of factors, including perceived changes in the underlying fundamental characteristics of the issuer, the relative price of alternative investments, interest rates, default rates, inflation, pandemics and general market conditions. Furthermore, amounts realized on the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold. We do not currently engage in derivative or other hedging transactions to manage our security price risk. As of September 30, 2024, we owned marketable securities with a value of 129. While it is difficult to project what factors may affect the prices of equity securities and how much the effect might be, a 10 change in the value of the marketable securities we owned as of September 30, 2024 would result in a change of 13 to the unrealized gain or loss on marketable securities. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we, under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of September 30, 2024, were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in this Quarterly Report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the rules and forms promulgated under the Exchange Act and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 
 Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 No change occurred in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d -15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities

 Share Redemption Plan 
 
 On November 27, 2012, we adopted a share redemption plan (the "Former SRP") whereby on a daily basis stockholders could request that we repurchase all or a portion of their shares of common stock. Pursuant to the the terms of the Former SRP, the redemption price per share was equal to our NAV per share of the class of shares being redeemed on the date of redemption. The total amount of redemptions in any calendar quarter was limited to shares whose aggregate value (based on the redemption price per share on the date of the redemption) was equal to 5.0 of our combined NAV for all classes of shares as of the last day of the previous calendar quarter. In addition, if redemptions did not reach the 5.0 limit in a calendar quarter, the unused portion generally would be carried over to the next quarter and not any subsequent quarter, except that the maximum amount of redemptions during any quarter could never exceed 10.0 of the combined NAV for all classes of shares as of the last day of the previous calendar quarter. While there was no minimum holding period, purchased shares (excluding shares acquired via our distribution reinvestment plan) redeemed within 365 days of an investor's initial date of purchase would be redeemed at our NAV per share of the class of shares being redeemed on the date of redemption less a short-term trading discount equal to 2 of the gross proceeds otherwise payable with respect to such purchased shares being redeemed. 
 
 On December 9, 2022, our board of directors modified the Former SRP to limit redemptions during the three months ended December 31, 2022 to 5.0 of our combined NAV as of September 30, 2022. During the fourth quarter of 2022, each quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, we received share redemption requests in excess of 5.0 of our combined NAV as of the last day of the immediately previous quarter. For these six quarters, we reached our applicable quarterly redemption volume limitation on December 19, 2022, February 23, 2023, April 25, 2023, July 4, 2023, October 9, 2023, and January 4, 2024, respectively. Pursuant to the terms of the Former SRP, all redemption requests received during a calendar quarter prior to such dates were satisfied 100 on a first-come, first-served basis. Redemptions received on these dates were satisfied on a pro rata basis at 11.7 , 43.9 , 57.4 , 34.4 , 62.2 and 84.4 of the requested amount, without regard to share class. As a result of reaching the quarterly redemption volume limitation during these quarters, we did not accept any redemption requests during the applicable quarter following the date on which such limitation was reached. Stockholders who wished to request redemption of any unfulfilled requests were required to resubmit their redemption requests beginning on the first calendar day of the following quarter. 
 
 66 

Table of Contents 

 Pursuant to the terms of our Former SRP, as the quarterly redemption volume limitation was reached on the third business day of the quarter ending March 31, 2024, redemption requests during the quarter ending June 30, 2024 were satisfied on a stockholder by stockholder basis, which was referred to as the per stockholder allocation, instead of a first-come, first-served basis. Pursuant to the per stockholder allocation, each of our stockholders were allowed to request redemption at any time during the quarter ending June 30, 2024, via one or more requests, of a total number of shares that in the aggregate did not exceed 5 of the shares of common stock the stockholder held as of March 31, 2024. 
 
 On June 21, 2024, our board of directors amended and restated our share redemption plan, effective July 1, 2024 (the "New SRP"). Pursuant to the New SRP, stockholders may request, on a monthly basis, that we redeem all or any portion of their shares of common stock, provided that such redemptions (i) will be effected at a redemption price (the Redemption Price equal to the NAV per share for such applicable class of shares as of a date (the Redemption Pricing Date that is at least ten business days before their redemption (the Redemption Date and (ii) will be limited to no more than 2.0 of our combined NAV per month and no more than 5.0 of our combined NAV per calendar quarter, with our combined NAV for each limit to be calculated as of the last calendar day of the prior quarter. After the close of business on the Redemption Pricing Date, and in any event no later than the opening of business on the immediately following business day, we will post the Redemption Price for each class of shares of common stock on our website. In the event that there is a material change in the NAV per share between the Redemption Pricing Date and the Redemption Date, we may determine that the previously-disclosed Redemption Price is no longer appropriate. If the Redemption Price for the applicable month is not made available by the tenth business day prior to the last business day of the month (or is changed after such date), then no redemption requests will be accepted for such month and stockholders who wish to have their shares redeemed the following month must resubmit their redemption requests. 
 
 While there is no minimum holding period, purchased shares (excluding shares acquired via our distribution reinvestment plan) redeemed within 365 days of the date of purchase will be redeemed at our NAV per share of the class of shares being redeemed on the Redemption Date less a short-term trading discount equal to 2.0 of the gross proceeds otherwise payable with respect to such purchased shares which are being redeemed. 
 
 In the event that any stockholder fails to maintain a minimum balance of 500 (not in thousands) worth of shares of common stock, we may redeem all of the shares held by that stockholder at the Redemption Price in effect for the month in which we redeem such shares, less the short-term trading discount of 2 , if applicable. Minimum account redemptions will apply even in the event that the failure to meet the minimum balance is caused solely by a decline in our NAV. Our board of directors has the discretion to suspend or modify the New SRP at any time. 
 
 The following table sets forth information regarding redemptions of shares of our common stock by month under the New SRP. Pursuant to the New SRP, redemption requests received by the Company during each month of
