Natural gas, oil and NGL sales 

Prior-period performance obligations and contract balances The Company records revenue in the month production is delivered to the purchaser. As a non-operator, the Company has limited visibility into the timing of when new wells start producing, and production statements may not be received for to or more after the date production is delivered. As a result, the Company is required to estimate the amount of production delivered to the purchaser and the price that will be received for the sale of the product. The expected sales volumes and prices for these properties are estimated and recorded within the natural gas, oil and NGL sales receivables line item on the Company s balance sheets. The difference between the Company's estimates and the actual amounts received for natural gas, oil and NGL sales is recorded in the quarter that payment is received from the third party. For the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue recognized during the reporting period related to performance obligations satisfied in prior reporting periods for existing wells was considered a change in estimate. As noted above, as a non-operator, there are instances when the Company is limited by the information operators provide. Through cash received on new wells, in the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company identified several producing properties on its minerals that had production dates prior to the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Estimates of the natural gas and oil sales related to those properties were made and are reflected in the natural gas, oil and NGL sales on the Company s Statements of Income and on the Company s Balance Sheets in natural gas, oil and NGL sales receivables. In connection with obtaining more relevant information on new wells on Company acreage during the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded a change in estimate for new wells to natural gas, oil and NGL sales totaling for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 , of which related to the production periods before January 1, 2024 and related to the six months ended June 30, 2024, and the Company recorded a change in estimate for new wells to natural gas, oil and NGL sales totaling for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 , of which related to the production periods before January 1, 2023 and related to the six months ended June 30, 2023. Lease bonus revenue The Company generates lease bonus revenue by leasing its mineral interests to exploration and production companies. A lease agreement represents the Company s contract with a third party and generally conveys the rights to any natural gas, oil or NGL discovered, grants the Company a right to a specified royalty interest and requires that drilling and completion operations commence within a specified time period. Control is transferred to the lessee and the Company has satisfied its performance obligation when the lease agreement is executed, such that revenue is recognized when the lease bonus payment is received. The Company accounts for its lease bonuses as conveyances in accordance with the guidance set forth in ASC 932 (Extractive Activities Oil and Gas), and upon leasing, it recognizes the lease bonus as a cost recovery with any excess above its cost basis in the mineral interests being treated as a gain. The excess of lease bonus above the mineral interests basis is shown in the lease bonuses and rental income line item on the Company s Statements of Income. Natural gas and oil derivative contracts See Note 9 for discussion of the Company s accounting for derivative contracts.

recorded in the income tax provision. The Company s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a provision as compared to a provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The change in effective tax rate resulted from a decrease in net income and the discrete income tax expense for deferred directors' compensation benefit, changes in state tax rates, and prior year true-ups recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

credit facility (the Credit Facility with a syndicate of banks led by Independent Bank pursuant to a credit agreement entered into in September 2021 (as amended, the Credit Agreement ). The Credit Facility had a borrowing base of and a maturity date of as of September 30, 2024 . The Credit Facility is secured by the Company s personal property and at least of the total value of the proved, developed and producing oil and gas properties. The interest rate is based on either (a) SOFR plus an applicable margin ranging from to per annum based on the Company s Borrowing Base Utilization or (b) the greater of (1) the Prime Rate in effect for such day, or (2) the overnight cost of federal funds as announced by the U.S. Federal Reserve System in effect on such day plus one-half of one percent ), plus, in each case, an applicable margin ranging from to per annum based on the Company s Borrowing Base Utilization. The election of Independent Bank prime or SOFR is at the Company s discretion. The interest rate spread from Independent Bank prime or SOFR will be charged based on the ratio of the loan balance to the borrowing base. The interest rate spread from SOFR or the prime rate increases as a larger percent of the borrowing base is advanced. At September 30, 2024, the effective interest rate was . The Company s debt is recorded at the carrying amount on its balance sheets. The carrying amount of the debt under the Credit Facility approximates fair value because the interest rates are reflective of market rates. Debt issuance costs associated with the Credit Facility are presented in Other, net on the Company s balance sheets. Total debt issuance cost, net of amortization, as of September 30, 2024 was . The debt issuance cost is amortized over the life of the Credit Facility. Determinations of the borrowing base under the Credit Facility are made semi-annually (usually in June and December) or whenever the lending banks, in their sole discretion, believe that there has been a material change in the value of the Company s natural gas and oil properties. The Credit Facility contains customary covenants which, among other things, require periodic financial and reserve reporting and place certain restrictions on the Company s ability to incur debt, grant liens, make fundamental changes and engage in certain transactions with affiliates. The Credit Facility also restricts the Company s ability to make certain restricted payments if before or after the Restricted Payment (i) the Available Commitment is less than ten percent of the Borrowing Base or (ii) the Leverage Ratio on a pro forma basis is greater than to 1.00. In addition, the Company is required to maintain certain financial ratios, a current ratio (as described in the Credit Facility) of no less than to 1.0 and a funded debt to EBITDAX of no more than to 1.0 based on the trailing twelve months.

 Natural Gas, Oil and NGL Reserves Management considers the estimation of the Company s natural gas, oil and NGL reserves to be the most significant of its judgments and estimates. Changes in natural gas, oil and NGL reserve estimates affect the Company s calculation of DD A, provision for retirement of assets and assessment of the need for asset impairments. On an annual basis, with a semi-annual update, the Company s Independent Consulting Petroleum Engineer, with assistance from Company staff, prepares estimates of natural gas, oil and NGL reserves based on available geologic and seismic data, reservoir pressure data, core analysis reports, well logs, analogous reservoir performance history, production data and other available sources of engineering, geologic and geophysical information. Between periods in which reserves would normally be calculated, the Company updates the reserve calculations utilizing appropriate prices for the current period. The estimated natural gas, oil and NGL reserves were computed using the 12-month average price calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month natural gas, oil and NGL price for each month within the -month period prior to the balance sheet date, held flat over the life of the properties. However, projected future natural gas, oil and NGL pricing assumptions are used by management to prepare estimates of natural gas, oil and NGL reserves and future net cash flows used in asset impairment assessments and in formulating management s overall operating decisions. Natural gas, oil and NGL prices are volatile, affected by worldwide production and consumption, and are outside the control of management. Impairment Company management monitors all long-lived assets, principally natural gas and oil properties, for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may be greater than its estimated future net cash flows. The evaluations involve significant judgment since the results are based on estimated future events, such as inflation rates; future drilling and completion costs; future sales prices for natural gas, oil and NGL; future production costs; estimates of future natural gas, oil and NGL reserves to be recovered and the timing thereof; the economic and regulatory climates; and other factors. The need to test a property for impairment may result from significant declines in sales prices or unfavorable adjustments to natural gas, oil and NGL reserves. Between periods in which reserves would normally be calculated, the Company updates the reserve calculations to reflect any material changes since the prior report was issued and then utilizes updated projected future price decks current with the period. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , management s assessment resulted in impairment provisions on producing properties. The Company wrote off on wells assigned to the operator with consideration received during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 .

 The fair value amounts recognized for the Company s derivative contracts executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement may be offset. The Company has the choice of whether or not to offset, but that choice must be applied consistently. A master netting arrangement exists if the reporting entity has multiple contracts with a single counterparty that are subject to a contractual agreement that provides for the net settlement of all contracts through a single payment in a single currency in the event of default on or termination of any one contract. Offsetting the fair values recognized for the derivative contracts outstanding with a single counterparty results in the net fair value of the transactions being reported as an asset or a liability in the Company s balance sheets. The following table summarizes and reconciles the Company s derivative contracts fair values at a gross level back to net fair value presentation on the Company s balance sheets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company has offset all amounts subject to master netting agreements in the Company's balance sheets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Level 2 Market Approach - The fair values of the Company s swaps and collars are based on a third-party pricing model, which utilizes inputs that are either readily available in the public market, such as natural gas curves and volatility curves, or can be corroborated from active markets. These values are based upon future prices, time to maturity and other factors. These values are then compared to the values given by our counterparties for reasonableness. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, and payables are considered to be representative of their respective fair values due to the short-term maturities of those instruments. Financial instruments include long-term debt, the valuation of which is classified as Level 2 as the carrying amount of the Company s debt under the Credit Facility approximates fair value because the interest rates are reflective of market rates. The estimated current market interest rates are based primarily on interest rates currently being offered on borrowings of similar amounts and terms. In addition, no valuation input adjustments were considered necessary relating to nonperformance risk for the debt agreements.

ITEM 2 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 BUSINESS OVERVIEW 
 PHX is an owner and manager of perpetual natural gas and oil mineral interests in resource plays in the United States. Our principal business is maximizing the value of our existing mineral and royalty assets through active management and expanding our asset base through acquisitions of additional mineral and royalty interests. 
 We also currently own interests in leasehold acreage and non-operated working interests in natural gas and oil properties. Exploration and development of our natural gas and oil properties is conducted by third-party natural gas and oil exploration and production companies (primarily larger independent operating companies). We do not operate any of our natural gas and oil properties. While we previously were an active working interest participant in wells drilled on our mineral and leasehold acreage, our current business strategy is growth through mineral acquisitions in our core areas of focus in the SCOOP and Haynesville and development of our significant mineral acreage inventory. We have ceased taking working interest positions on our mineral and leasehold acreage and do not plan to take any working interest positions going forward. 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Our results of operations depend primarily upon our existing reserve quantities; costs associated with acquiring new reserves; production quantities and related production costs; and natural gas, oil and NGL prices. Although we still receive revenue from the production and sale of natural gas, oil and NGL on our working interests, the majority of our revenue is derived from royalties received from the production and sale of natural gas, oil and NGL. 
 QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 COMPARED TO QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 
 Overview: 
 We recorded net income of 1,100,310, or 0.03 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to net income of 1,895,403, or 0.05 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The change in net income was principally the result of a decrease in natural gas, oil and NGL sales, a decrease in lease bonuses, an increase in transportation, gathering and marketing expenses and an increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses, partially offset by an increase in gains associated with our derivative contracts. These items are further discussed below.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease in natural gas, oil and NGL sales was primarily due a decrease in natural gas prices of 22 and decreases in oil and NGL volumes of 6 and 1 , respectively, partially offset by an increase in gas volumes of 7 . The following table outlines our production and average sales prices for natural gas, oil and NGL for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023:

The production increase in royalty volumes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, resulted primarily from new wells in the Haynesville Shale and SCOOP plays coming online. The production decrease in working interest volumes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to t he nine months ended September 30, 2023, resulted from natural production decline.

When we lease our mineral interests, we generally receive an upfront cash payment, or lease bonus. Lease bonuses and rental income decreased 600,027 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 period compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as the result of decreased leasing activity.

 The change in net (loss) gain on derivative contracts was due to the settlements of natural gas and oil collars and fixed price swaps and the change in valuation caused by the difference in September 30, 2024 pricing relative to the strike price on open derivative contracts. 
 Our natural gas and oil costless collar contracts and fixed price swaps in place at September 30, 2024 had expiration dates through June 2026. We utilize derivative contracts for the purpose of protecting our cash flow and reducing our exposure to short-term fluctuations in the price of natural gas and oil.

We are responsible for a portion of LOE relating to a well as a working interest owner. LOE includes normal recurring and nonrecurring expenses associated with our working interests necessary to produce hydrocarbons from our natural gas and oil wells, including maintenance, repairs, salt water disposal, insurance and workover expenses. Total LOE related to field operating costs decreased 358,348, or 28 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in LOE was principally the result of the divestiture of higher LOE working interest properties.

This increase was primarily driven by the increase in production. Natural gas sales bear the large majority of our transportation, gathering and marketing fees, and the increase in production occurred in an area of the Louisiana Haynesville with higher transportation, gathering and marketing rates.

Production taxes are paid on produced natural gas and oil based on either a percentage of revenues from products sold at both fixed and variable rates or a fixed rate per unit produced established by federal, state or local taxing authorities. Production taxes remained relatively flat in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

DD A is the amount of cost basis of natural gas and oil properties attributable to the volume of hydrocarbons extracted during such period, calculated on a units-of-production basis for working interest, and on a straight-line basis for producing and non-producing minerals. Estimates of proved developed producing reserves are a major component of the calculation of depletion. DD A increased 877,604, or 14 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, of which 282,428 of the increase resulted from production increasing 5 and an increase of 595,176 resulted from a 0.08 increase in the DD A rate per MCFE. The purchase of additional minerals, conversions of overriding royalty interest and a large transfer of non-producing minerals, which are amortized over 33 years, to producing minerals, which are amortized over 20 years, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 contributed to the increase in DD A. 
 Provision for Impairment: 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was no impairment recognized. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, impairment of 38,533 was related to working interest wells in which we assigned our interests to the operator.

Operating activities: 
 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased 5,601,832 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as the result of the following: 
 receipts on natural gas, oil and NGL sales (net of production taxes and gathering, transportation and marketing costs) and other decreasing by 7,793,227; 

decreased lease bonus receipts of 657,293; and 

increased interest payments of 388,380;

 increased net receipts on derivative contracts of 1,503,764; 

decreased payments for G A and other expense of 290,133;

decreased field operating expenses of 130,935; and 

decreased income tax payments of 1,312,236. 

Investing activities: 
 Net cash used in investing activities decreased 11,338,181 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower acquisition costs of 20,110,912 and lower payments of 256,768 for capital expenditures on legacy working interest wells and furniture and fixtures, partially offset by lower net proceeds from the sale of assets of 9,029,499. 
 Financing activities: 
 Net cash used in financing activities increased 3,060,463 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to net payments on long-term debt of 5,000,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net payments of 2,550,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and an increase of 1,171,294 in dividend payments, partially offset by decreased cash payments on off-market derivative contracts of 560,162. 
 Capital Resources: 
 We had no capital expenditures to drill and complete new wells in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 as a result of our strategy to cease participating in new wells with a working interest after fiscal year 2019. We currently have no remaining commitments that would require significant capital to drill and complete wells. 
 Since we decided to cease any further participation with working interests on our mineral and leasehold acreage, we anticipate that capital expenditures for working interest properties will be minimal, as the expenditures will be limited to capital workovers to enhance existing wells.

 We received lease bonus payments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaling approximately 0.5 million and 1.1 million, respectively. Management plans to continue to actively pursue leasing opportunities. 
 With continued natural gas and oil price volatility, management continues to evaluate opportunities for product price protection through additional hedging of our future natural gas and oil production. See Note 9: Derivatives in the notes to our condensed financial statements included in this Form 10-Q for a complete list of our outstanding derivative contracts at September 30, 2024.

Outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility at September 30, 2024 were 27,750,000. 
 Looking forward, we expect to fund overhead costs, mineral and royalty acquisitions and dividend payments from cash provided by operating activities, cash on hand, and borrowings under our Credit Facility. At September 30, 2024, we had availability of 22.3 million under our Credit Facility and were in compliance with all debt covenants (current ratio, debt to trailing 12-month EBITDAX, and restricted payments limited by leverage ratio). The debt covenants in our Credit Agreement limit the maximum ratio of our debt to EBITDAX to no more than 3.5:1. 
 Our 100,000,000 Credit Facility is with a group of banks led by Independent Bank pursuant to the Credit Agreement entered into in September 2021, as amended. The Credit Facility had a borrowing base of 50,000,000 as of September 30, 2024, and a maturity date of September 1, 2028. Interest on the Credit Facility will be calculated based on either (a) SOFR plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.750 to 3.750 per annum based on our Borrowing Base Utilization or (b) the greater of (1) the Prime Rate in effect for such day or (2) the overnight cost of federal funds as announced by the US Federal Reserve System in effect on such day plus one-half of one percent (0.50 ), plus, in each case, an applicable margin ranging from 1.750 to 2.750 per annum based on our Borrowing Base Utilization. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, a 5 interest penalty may apply to any outstanding amount not paid when due or that remains outstanding while an event of default exists. The Credit Agreement contains financial and various other covenants that are common in such agreements, including a (a) maximum ratio of consolidated Funded Indebtedness to consolidated pro forma EBITDAX of 3.50 to 1.00, calculated on a rolling four-quarter basis, and (b) minimum ratio of consolidated Current Assets to consolidated Current Liabilities (excluding the Loan Balance) of 1.00 to 1.00. Other negative covenants include restrictions on our ability to incur debt, grant liens, make fundamental changes and engage in certain transactions with affiliates. The Credit Agreement also restricts our ability to make certain restricted payments if both before and after the Restricted Payment (i) the Available Commitment is less than or equal to ten percent (10 of the Borrowing Base or (ii) the Leverage Ratio on a pro forma basis is greater than 2.50 to 1.00. All capitalized terms in this description of the Credit Facility that are not otherwise defined in this Form 10-Q have the meaning assigned to them in the Credit Agreement. 
 Based on our expected capital expenditure levels, anticipated cash provided by operating activities for 2024, combined with availability under our Credit Facility and potential future sales of Common Stock under our currently effective shelf registration statement, we expect to have sufficient liquidity to fund our ongoing operations.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 Critical accounting policies are those we believe are most important in portraying our financial condition and results of operations and also require the greatest amount of subjective or complex judgments by management. Judgments and uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under various conditions or using different assumptions. There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 
 There have been no material changes in our contractual obligations and other commitments as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 ITEM 3 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 Natural gas, oil and NGL prices historically have been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue. Uncertainty continues to exist as to the direction of natural gas, oil and NGL price trends, and there remains a wide divergence in the opinions held in the industry. We can be significantly impacted by changes in natural gas and oil prices. The market price of natural gas, oil and NGL in 2024 will impact the amount of cash generated from operating activities, which will in turn impact the level of our capital expenditures for acquisitions and production. Excluding the impact of our 2024 derivative contracts, the price sensitivity for each 0.10 per MCF change in wellhead natural gas price is approximately 745,708 for operating revenue based on our fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 natural gas volumes. The price sensitivity in 2024 for each 1.00 per barrel change in wellhead oil is approximately 182,916 for operating revenue based on our fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 oil volumes. 
 Financial Market Risk 
 Operating income could also be impacted, to a lesser extent, by changes in the market interest rates related to our Credit Facility. Interest under our Credit Facility is calculated based on either (a) SOFR plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.750 to 3.750 per annum based on our Borrowing Base Utilization or (b) the greater of (1) the Prime Rate in effect for such day or (2) the overnight cost of federal funds as announced by the U.S. Federal Reserve System in effect on such day plus one-half of one percent (0.50 ), plus, in each case, an applicable margin ranging from 1.750 to 2.750 per annum based on our Borrowing Base Utilization. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, a 5 interest penalty may apply to any outstanding amount not paid when due or that remains outstanding while an event of default exists. At September 30, 2024, we had 27,750,000 outstanding under the Credit Facility and the effective interest rate was 8.36 . The impact of a 1 increase in the interest rate on this amount of debt would have resulted in an increase in interest expense, and a corresponding decrease in our results of operations, of 208,125 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, assuming that our indebtedness remained constant throughout the period. At this point, we do not believe that our liquidity has been materially affected by the debt market uncertainties that have existed in recent years, and we do not believe that our liquidity will be significantly impacted in the near future. All capitalized terms in this description of the interest rate under the Credit Facility that are not otherwise defined in this Form 10-Q shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Credit Agreement. 
 ITEM 4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is collected and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that no matter how well conceived and operated, disclosure controls and procedures can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Our disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to meet, and management believes they do meet, reasonable assurance standards. Based on their evaluation as of the end of the quarterly period covered by this Form 10-Q, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure material information relating to us is made known to management. 
 27 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting made during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 We may be the subject of threatened or pending legal actions and contingencies in the normal course of conducting our business. We provide for costs related to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The effect of the outcome of these matters on our future results of operations and liquidity cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations and the amount or timing of the resolution of such matters. For certain types of claims, we maintain insurance coverage for personal injury and property damage, product liability and other liability coverages in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are prudent, but there can be no assurance that these coverages will be applicable or adequate to cover adverse outcomes of claims or legal proceedings against us. We are not a party to any pending legal proceedings that we believe would, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results or cash flow. 
 ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS 
 We are subject to certain risks and hazards due to the nature of our business activities. For a discussion of these risks, please refer to Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 as well as the factors discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. There have been no material changes to the risk factors contained in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. 
 ITEM 2 UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 In May 2014, the Board adopted stock repurchase resolutions (the Repurchase Program to allow management, at its discretion, to purchase our Common Stock as treasury shares. Effective in May 2018, the Board approved an amendment to the Repurchase Program, which continues to allow us to repurchase up to 1.5 million of our Common Stock at management s discretion. Our Board added language to clarify that the Repurchase Program is intended to be an evergreen program as the repurchase of an additional 1.5 million of our Common Stock is authorized and approved whenever the previous 1.5 million is utilized. The Repurchase Program, as amended, does not otherwise place a cap on the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be repurchased pursuant to the Repurchase Program. We made no repurchases of Common Stock under the Repurchase Program during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 Restrictions upon the payment of dividends 
 The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants which, among other things, require periodic financial and reserve reporting and place certain limits on payment of dividends.
