 real estate properties consisting of multifamily properties, industrial properties, single-family rental property and retail property. The Company also has real estate debt investments and an investment in U.S. Treasury bills. The Company currently operates in reportable segments: multifamily, industrial, single-family rental, retail and investments in real estate debt, real estate-related and other securities. See Note 15 for a description of the Company's segment reporting. The Company depends on the Adviser and its affiliates for certain services that are essential to it, including the distribution of the Company s shares of common stock, acquisition and disposition decisions, and certain other responsibilities. If the Adviser and its affiliates were unable or unwilling to provide such services, the Company would be required to find alternative service providers. 

 billion in shares of common stock, consisting of up to billion in shares in its primary offering and up to billion in shares pursuant to its distribution reinvestment plan (the Offering, and together with the Company s private offerings described below, the Offerings ). The Registration Statement was declared effective by the SEC on July 22, 2022. The Company is selling any combination of four classes of shares of its common stock, Class D shares, Class I shares, Class S shares and Class T shares, with a dollar value up to the maximum offering amount. The share classes have different upfront selling commissions and ongoing stockholder servicing fees. Until the Company issues any Class T shares, the initial per-share purchase price for the Company s Class T shares is equal to the most recently determined net asset value NAV per share for the Class E common stock Class E shares sold in the Company s private offering, plus, applicable upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees. The purchase price per share for each class of the Company s common stock will vary and will generally equal the prior month s NAV per share for such class, as determined monthly, plus any applicable upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees. On November 15, 2021, the Company was capitalized with a million investment by the Adviser in exchange for shares of the Company s Class E common stock. The Adviser has agreed to not sell, transfer or dispose of the shares to any party other than an affiliate of the Adviser for so long as the Adviser or its affiliate performs an advisory function for the Company. Pursuant to a separate private offering whose commitments have been fully called, as of September 30, 2024, the Company had sold million in Class E shares and million in Class E units of the Operating Partnership Class E units ), including million Class E shares and million Class E units purchased by JPMIM (collectively, the Initial Capitalization ). In addition, as of September 30, 2024, the Company sold million in Class E shares to employees of the Adviser. JPMIM has agreed to hold all of the Class E shares and Class E units it purchased as part of the Initial Capitalization (the JPM Initial Capitalization until the earlier of (i) the first date that the Company s NAV reaches billion and (ii) July 22, 2025, the third anniversary of the commencement of the Offering. Following such date, each month the Company will repurchase, without further action by JPMIM (each, a JPM Mandatory Repurchase (see Note 13), a number of Class E shares or Class E units from JPMIM in an amount equal to the amount available under the share repurchase plan s monthly and quarterly caps after satisfying repurchase requests from investors who purchase shares pursuant to the Offering and other holders of shares that are otherwise subject to repurchase under the share repurchase plan, until such time as the JPM Initial Capitalization has been fully repurchased; provided, that the number of shares subject to each JPM Mandatory Repurchase may be reduced where other holders of Class E shares that were issued pursuant to the Initial Capitalization and are not subject to repurchase under the share repurchase plan request repurchase of their shares, in which case the Class E shares held by JPMIM and such other investors will be repurchased on a pro rata basis based on their respective percentage ownership in the Company immediately prior to such repurchase (not to exceed an aggregate number of shares equal to the amount available under the share repurchase plan s monthly and quarterly caps). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will not effect any JPM Mandatory Repurchase during any month in which the full amount of all shares requested to be repurchased by stockholders other than JPMIM under the share repurchase plan is not repurchased or when the share repurchase plan has been suspended.

or lesser interest in the Company, the Company will, or will cause the Operating Partnership to, automatically and without further action by the Adviser, repurchase or redeem, as applicable, an amount of shares or units from the Adviser as may be necessary to cause the JPM Interest to remain equal to or less than . To the extent the Adviser elects to receive its management fee in shares of the Company s common stock or Operating Partnership units, the Company may repurchase those shares or units without regard to the limitations described above or the early repurchase deduction. On May 26, 2022, JPMIM s Subscription Agreement dated February 23, 2022 for Class E shares or Class E units was amended to provide that, if the Company receives capital commitments from investors in the private placement of Class E shares exceeding million Other Seed Investor Commitments ), JPMIM s commitment may, in JPMIM s discretion, be reduced by an amount equal to (i) the aggregate amount of Other Seed Investor Commitments, minus (ii) million, provided that such reduction amount will not exceed million. The amendment to the Subscription Agreement also provided that the expiration of the JPMIM commitment was , which was the 18-month anniversary of the date of the Subscription Agreement; provided, that following such date JPMIM may, in its discretion, elect to purchase additional Class E shares or Class E units until the earlier to occur of (i) July 22, 2025, the three-year anniversary of the date that the Registration Statement was declared effective by the SEC and (ii) the date that the Company s NAV is at least billion. On November 13, 2023, the Company filed Articles of Amendment (the "Articles of Amendment") to its Articles of Amendment and Restatement, dated June 2, 2022 (as supplemented, amended or amended and restated to date, the "Charter"), to increase the number of shares of capital stock the Company has authority to issue to billion and the number of shares of common stock, par value per share, that the Company has authority to issue to billion. Immediately following the filing of the Articles of Amendment, the Company filed the Articles Supplementary to the Charter, pursuant to which the Company classified and designated billion authorized but unissued shares of Class X common stock, par value per share, and billion authorized but unissued shares of Class Y common stock, par value per share. On April 16, 2024, the Company filed Articles Supplementary to the Charter pursuant to which the Company reclassified and designated billion authorized but unissued Class X shares as shares of a new Class X common stock, par value per share, and fixed the preferences, rights, powers, restrictions, limitations, qualifications, terms and conditions of the newly designated Class X shares.

 Over lease term 

Repairs and maintenance are expensed to operations as incurred and are included in property operating expenses on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations. Significant improvements to properties are capitalized. When assets are sold or retired, their costs and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts with the resulting gains or losses reflected in net income or loss for the period. The Company records acquired above-market and below-market leases at their fair values (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired). In the case of an above-market lease, the excess payment (the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be received pursuant to the lease and (2) management s estimate of fair-market lease rates for the lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease) is recorded as an asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In the case of a below-market lease, the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be received pursuant to the lease and (2) management s estimate of fair-market lease rates for the lease, measured over a period equal to the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed-rate renewal options is recorded as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on the Company s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease. Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, the Company includes real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, the Company considers leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses. The amortization of acquired above-market and below-market leases is recorded as an adjustment to rental revenue on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations. The amortization of in-place leases is recorded as an adjustment to depreciation and amortization expense on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company s management reviews the Company s real estate properties for impairment when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impaired value. Since cash flows on real estate properties considered to be "long-lived assets to be held and used" are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired, the Company s strategy of holding properties over the long term decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss. If the Company s strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material to the Company s results. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be reduced to their estimated fair value. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , such impairments occurred. 
 unrealized gain or loss was recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Interest income from the Company s investments in real estate debt is recognized over the life of each investment using the effective interest method and is recorded on the accrual basis. Recognition of premiums and discounts associated with these investments is deferred and recorded over the term of the investment as an adjustment to yield. Upfront costs and fees related to items for which the FVO is elected are recognized in earnings as incurred and are not deferred. Interest income, upfront costs and fees are recorded as a component of income from investments in real estate debt on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 Valuation of assets and liabilities not measured at fair value The fair value of the Company s financial instruments (other than mortgage notes and the Repurchase Facility), including cash and cash equivalents and other financial instruments, approximate their carrying or contract value. The fair value of the Company s indebtedness is estimated by modeling the cash flows required by the Company s debt agreements and discounting them back to the present value using an appropriate discount rate. Additionally, the Company considers current market rates and conditions by evaluating similar borrowing agreements with comparable loan-to-value ratios and credit profiles. The inputs used in determining the fair value of the Company s indebtedness are considered Level 3.

 of the aggregate NAV per month (measured using the aggregate NAV attributable to stockholders as of the end of the immediately preceding month) and of the aggregate NAV per calendar quarter (measured using the average aggregate NAV attributable to stockholders as of the end of the immediately preceding three months). Shares are repurchased at a price equal to the transaction price on the applicable repurchase date, subject to any early repurchase deduction. Shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year are repurchased at of the transaction price. If the Company determines to repurchase some but not all of the shares submitted for repurchase during any month, shares submitted for repurchase during such month will be repurchased on a pro rata basis based on the amount requested after the Company has repurchased all shares for which repurchase was requested due to death or disability and other limited exceptions. All unsatisfied repurchase requests must be resubmitted after the start of the next month or quarter, or upon the recommencement of the share repurchase plan, as applicable. Due to the illiquid nature of investments in real estate, the Company may not have sufficient liquid resources to fund repurchase requests and has established limitations on the amount of funds the Company may use for repurchases during any calendar month and quarter. Should repurchase requests, in the Company's judgment, place an undue burden on the Company's liquidity, adversely affect the Company's operations or risk having an adverse impact on the Company as a whole, or should the Company otherwise determine that investing its liquid assets in real properties or other investments rather than repurchasing its shares is in the best interests of the Company as a whole, the Company may choose to repurchase fewer shares in any particular month than have been requested to be repurchased, or none at all. Further, the Company's board of directors may make exceptions to, modify or suspend the share repurchase plan if in its reasonable judgment it deems such action to be in the Company's best interest and the best interests of the Company's stockholders.

Such Class E shares will only be eligible for repurchase following the earlier to occur of (i) July 22, 2025, which is the third anniversary of the date the Company commenced the Offering, and (ii) the date that the Company s aggregate NAV is at least billion. Following such period, holders of Class E shares (other than the Class E shares purchased by JPMIM as part of the Initial Capitalization, which are subject to special terms discussed below in the JPMIM mandatory Class E repurchases section) may request that the Company repurchase their Class E shares on a monthly basis. The Company will repurchase Class E shares at a price per share equal to the most recently determined NAV per Class E share as of the repurchase date. The aggregate amount of Class E shares issued in the Initial Capitalization that the Company is required to repurchase in any month will be limited to an amount equal to any remaining availability for share repurchases pursuant to the terms and conditions of the share repurchase plan, after the Company has fulfilled all repurchase requests submitted pursuant to the share repurchase plan. In addition, the Company will not repurchase any Class E shares during any period that the share repurchase plan has been suspended. The Class E shares issued in the Initial Capitalization are not eligible for repurchase pursuant to the share repurchase plan. However, the Class E shares that the Company issues to employees or affiliates of J.P.

The Company will repurchase Class E and Class I shares at a price per share equal to the most recently determined NAV per Class E and Class I share, respectively, as of the repurchase date.

Following such date, each month the Company will repurchase, without further action by JPMIM, a number of Class E shares or Class E units from JPMIM in an amount equal to the amount available under the share repurchase plan s monthly and quarterly caps after satisfying repurchase requests from investors who purchase shares pursuant to the Offering and any other holders of shares that are otherwise subject to repurchase under the share repurchase plan, until such time as the JPM Initial Capitalization has been fully repurchased; provided, that the number of shares subject to each JPM Mandatory Repurchase may be reduced where other holders of Class E shares that were issued pursuant to the Initial Capitalization and are not subject to repurchase under the share repurchase plan request repurchase of their shares, in which case the Class E shares held by JPMIM and such other investors will be repurchased on a pro rata basis based on their respective percentage ownership in the Company immediately prior to such repurchase (not to exceed an aggregate number of shares equal to the amount available under the share repurchase plan s monthly and quarterly caps). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will not effect any JPM Mandatory Repurchase during any month in which the full amount of all shares requested to be repurchased by stockholders other than JPMIM under the share repurchase plan is not repurchased or when the share repurchase plan has been suspended.

Assumptions relating to these statements involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to accurately predict and many of which are beyond our control. Such forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and there are or may be important factors that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in such statements. We believe these factors also include those described under the section entitled Item IA.

These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included in this document (or our prospectus and other filings). Except as otherwise required by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. 
 Overview 
 We are a Maryland corporation formed on November 5, 2021. We were formed to invest primarily in stabilized, income-generating real properties. We are an externally advised, perpetual-life REIT formed to pursue the following investment objectives: 
 provide attractive current income in the form of regular, stable cash distributions; 

preserve and protect invested capital; 

realize appreciation in NAV from proactive investment management and asset management; and 

provide an investment alternative for stockholders seeking to allocate a portion of their long-term investment portfolios to real estate. 

We cannot assure you that we will achieve our investment objectives. In particular, we note that our NAV may be subject to volatility related to changes in the values of our assets. 
 We currently qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes and intend to continuously qualifiy as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. We own all or substantially all of our assets through the Operating Partnership, of which we are the sole general partner. 
 Our board of directors at all times has ultimate oversight and policymaking authority over us, including responsibility for governance, financial controls, compliance and disclosure. Pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, however, we have delegated to the Adviser the authority to source, evaluate and monitor our investment opportunities and make decisions related to the acquisition, management, financing and disposition of our assets, in accordance with our investment objectives, guidelines, policies and limitations, subject to oversight by our board of directors. 
 The initial public offering of our common stock (the Offering commenced on July 22, 2022. We acquired our first investment on September 2, 2022. In addition to the Offering, we are conducting several private offerings (together with the Offering, the Offerings ). 
 We intend to contribute to the Operating Partnership the net proceeds from the Offering which are not used or retained to pay the fees and expenses attributable to our operations. The Operating Partnership will use the net proceeds received from us to make investments in accordance with our investment strategy and policies. 
 The number and type of properties or real estate-related and other investments that we acquire will depend upon real estate market conditions, the amount of proceeds we raise in the Offerings and other circumstances existing at the time we are acquiring such assets. 
 34 

We are not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, favorable or unfavorable, other than national economic conditions affecting real estate generally, that may be reasonably anticipated to have a material impact on either capital resources or the revenues or income to be derived from acquiring properties, real estate debt and real estate-related or other securities.

Rental revenue 
 Due to our acquisitions of real estate since September 30, 2023, our rental revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 are not comparable. Rental revenue primarily consists of base rent arising from tenant leases at our multifamily, single-family rental, industrial and retail properties. Rental revenue, aside from short-term leases generally less than one year in term, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease, including any fixed and measurable rent escalations and abatements. 
 Rental property operating expenses 
 Rental property operating expenses consist of the costs of ownership and operation of our real estate investments. Examples of rental property operating expenses include insurance, utilities, real estate taxes and repair and maintenance expenses. Rental property operating expenses also include general and administrative expenses unrelated to the operations of the properties. Due to our acquisitions of real estate since September 30, 2023, our rental property operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 are not comparable. 
 General and administrative expenses 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses increased by 0.4 million and 0.3 million, respectively, in comparison to the corresponding periods in 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by an increase in management fees of 0.2 million and an increase in accrued performance participation allocation of 0.2 million. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by an increase in management fees of 0.5 million and an increase in accrued performance participation allocation of 0.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in general corporate costs, such as professional fees, legal fees and insurance premiums, of 0.5 million. 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by the fair values assigned to buildings, personal property and in-place lease assets as part of the initial purchase price allocation. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, depreciation and amortization expense increased by 1.1 million and decreased by 1.0 million, respectively, in comparison to the corresponding periods in 2023. Depreciation expense increased as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023 due to our acquisitions of real estate since September 30, 2023. Amortization expense decreased as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023 due to in-place lease intangibles recorded as part of the purchase price allocation for properties acquired during the year ended December 31, 2022 fully amortizing during the year ended December 31, 2023, offset by the amortization of in-place lease intangibles acquired as part of an acquisition we made in May 2024. 
 Mandatorily redeemable instruments interest costs 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, costs related to our Mandatorily Redeemable Instruments increased by 0.9 million and decreased by 0.2 million in comparison to the corresponding periods in 2023. The increase in mandatorily redeemable instruments interest costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was due to an increase in allocation of appreciation of 0.8 million relating to the redemption value adjustment of the Mandatorily Redeemable Instruments and an increase in distribution expense of 0.1 million. The decrease in mandatorily redeemable instruments interest costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to a decrease in allocation of appreciation of 1.5 million offset by an increase in distribution expense of 1.3 million. 
 Interest expense 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense increased by 0.4 million and decreased by 0.1 million in comparison to the corresponding periods in 2023. Interest expense primarily consists of interest expense incurred on our mortgage notes, Credit Facility and Repurchase Facility. The change in interest expense was primarily attributable to a decrease in interest expense relating to our Credit Facility and a decrease in the amortization of deferred financing costs, offset by an increase in interest expense relating to new mortgage notes and new borrowings under the Repurchase Facility. 
 41 

Other income (expense), net 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, other income (expense), net increased by 0.7 million and 1.1 million in comparison to the corresponding periods in 2023. The change in other income (expense), net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to an increase in realized gains on treasury futures of 0.8 million, partially offset by an increase in unrealized losses of 0.2 million. The increase in other income (expense), net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in interest income of 1.2 million, a decrease in dead deal costs of 0.2 million and an increase in realized gains on treasury futures of 0.4 million, partially offset by unrealized losses of 0.7 million on our derivatives. 
 Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated joint ventures 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, net loss attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated joint ventures increased by 0.02 million and decreased by 0.04 million in comparison to the corresponding periods in 2023. Net loss attributable to non-controlling interest in consolidated joint ventures was due to the 5 non-controlling interest in the Caroline West Gray, Caroline Post Oak and Shops at Grand Avenue properties held by our joint venture partner. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary needs for liquidity and capital resources are to fund our investments, to make distributions to our stockholders, to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase plan, to pay our offering and operating fees and expenses and to pay interest on any outstanding indebtedness we may incur. Our offering and operating fees and expenses include the management fee we will pay to the Adviser, the performance participation allocation that the Operating Partnership will pay to the Special Limited Partner, stockholder servicing fees we pay to the Dealer Manager, legal, audit, tax and valuation expenses, federal and state filing fees, printing expenses, administrative fees, transfer agent fees, marketing and distribution expenses and fees related to acquiring, financing, appraising and managing our properties. We do not have any office or personnel expenses as we do not have any employees. 
 The Adviser advanced our organization and offering expenses (other than upfront selling commissions, dealer manager fees and stockholder servicing fees) on our behalf through July 22, 2024, which marked the second anniversary of the commencement of the Offering. We began reimbursing the Adviser for such advanced expenses ratably over the 60 months following such date. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reimbursed 0.3 million to the Adviser. We accrued approximately 7.2 million and 6.7 million of organization and offering expenses payable to the Adviser which are included in due to affiliate on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In addition, the Adviser will advance on our behalf certain of our operating expenses through the earlier of (i) the first date that our NAV reaches 500 million and (ii) December 31, 2024 at which point we will reimburse the Adviser for all such advanced expenses ratably over the 60 months following such date. The Adviser advanced, and we accrued, approximately 10.6 million and 7.9 million of operating expenses which are included in due to affiliate on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 We elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, effective January 1, 2023. In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we are required to, among other things, distribute as dividends at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and excluding net capital gains, to our stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of our income and assets. 
 On November 15, 2021, we were capitalized with a 0.2 million investment by the Adviser in exchange for 20,000 shares of our Class E common stock. The Adviser has agreed to not sell, transfer or dispose of the shares to any party other than an affiliate of the Adviser for so long as the Adviser or its affiliate performs an advisory function for us. 
 Pursuant to a private offering whose commitments have been fully called, as of September 30, 2024, we had sold 67.9 million in Class E shares and 94.2 million in Class E units, including 0.5 million Class E shares and 9.0 million Class E units purchased by JPMIM. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, we had sold 3.3 million in Class E shares to employees of the Adviser. 
 Over time, we generally intend to fund our cash needs for items other than asset acquisitions from operations. Our cash needs for acquisitions will be funded primarily from the sale of shares of our common stock and through the assumption or incurrence of secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders and proceeds from the sales of assets. If necessary, we may use financings or other sources of capital in the event of unforeseen significant capital expenditures. 
 If we are unable to raise substantial funds, we will make fewer investments, resulting in less diversification in terms of the type, number and size of investments we make and the value of an investment in us will fluctuate with the performance of the specific assets we acquire. Further, we have certain fixed operating expenses, including certain expenses as a publicly offered REIT, regardless of whether we are able to raise substantial funds. Our inability to raise substantial funds would increase our fixed operating expenses as a percentage of gross income, reducing our net income and limiting our ability to make distributions.

On August 31, 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the "Credit Facility") with U.S. Bank National Association. The Credit Facility provided for aggregate commitments of up to 65 million for secured revolving loans and letter of credit issuances, with an accordion feature pursuant to which the Operating Partnership may increase the aggregate commitments up to 150 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The Credit Facility may be used to fund acquisitions, to repurchase shares pursuant to our share repurchase plan or for any other corporate purpose. Funds available under the Credit Facility may be reduced at any given time if we use borrowings under the Credit Facility to fund share repurchases, distributions, investments, or for other corporate purposes. We amended the Credit Facility on August 25, 2023 to (i) extend the maturity date to August 29, 2024, (ii) decrease the aggregate commitments from up to 65 million to up to 8 million and (iii) increase the applicable margin to 2.45 . 
 Effective March 12, 2024, we executed and delivered a Facility Reduction Request (the "Facility Reduction Request") requesting a decrease in the maximum commitments of the Credit Facility to 0.0 million. The delivery of the Facility Reduction Request permanently reduced the aggregate commitments available under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility terminated at maturity on August 29, 2024. 
 On April 2, 2024, a wholly owned subsidiary of ours closed on a five year, 10.0 million loan secured by 6200 Bristol. The loan carries an interest rate of SOFR plus 2.05 . In conjunction with the loan transaction, we entered into an interest rate swap which fixed the interest rate at 6.26 .

 On August 22, 2024, certain of our indirect subsidiaries (the Sellers entered into a Master Repurchase Agreement (the Repurchase Facility with U.S. Bank National Association (the Buyer ). The Repurchase Facility provides for a maximum aggregate purchase price of 150 million and has a three-year term plus two, one-year extension options. Subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the Repurchase Facility provides for the purchase, sale and repurchase of senior mortgage loans and participation interests in performing senior mortgage loans satisfying certain conditions set forth in the Repurchase Facility. 
 Advances under the Repurchase Facility accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to the Term SOFR Base Rate (as defined in the Repurchase Facility) for a one-month period plus a margin as agreed upon by the Buyer and Seller for each transaction. The Repurchase Facility contains affirmative and negative covenants and provisions regarding events of default that are normal and customary for similar repurchase facilities. The Operating Partnership has agreed to provide a limited guarantee of the obligations of the Sellers under the Repurchase Facility.

Cash flows provided by operating activities increased by 3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to a decrease of 3.4 million in our net loss as a result of the growth of our portfolio. 
 Cash flows used in investing activities increased by 62.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to the origination of the Commercial Mortgage Loan. 
 Cash flows provided by financing activities increased by 38.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to a decrease in repayments of the Credit Facility of 40.2 million, an increase in net proceeds from mortgage notes and the Repurchase Facility of 10.0 million and 46.8 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of mandatorily redeemable instruments of 47.2 million, a decrease in proceeds from common stock of 8.9 million, an increase in distributions of 2.0 million and an increase in the repurchase of common stock of 0.4 million. 
 Distributions 
 We generally intend to distribute substantially all of our taxable income, which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP, to our stockholders each year to comply with the REIT provisions of the Code. Each class of common stock receives the same gross distribution per share. The net distribution varies for each class based on the applicable stockholder servicing fee, which is deducted from the monthly distribution per share. 
 The following tables detail the aggregate distributions declared for each applicable class of common stock:

For purposes of NAV, we recognize the stockholder servicing fee as a reduction of NAV on a monthly basis as such fee is paid. Under GAAP, we accrue the lifetime cost of the stockholder servicing fee as an offering cost at the time Class D, Class S, Class T and Class Y shares are sold. The stockholder servicing fee on Class D shares was waived as of September 30, 2024, and the NAV attributable to current holders of Class D shares will not be included in the computation of stockholder servicing fees charged on Class D shares in perpetuity. As of September 30, 2024, we had accrued stockholder servicing fees of 1.0 million.

 In addition to the distributions paid on our common stock, we paid 1.1 million and 3.2 million for Mandatorily Redeemable Instruments during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Such amounts are recorded in mandatorily redeemable instruments interest costs on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively. 
 Net Asset Value 
 Our board of directors, including a majority of our independent directors, has adopted valuation guidelines that contain a comprehensive set of methodologies to be used by the Adviser and our independent valuation advisor in connection with estimating the values of our assets and liabilities for purposes of our NAV calculation. The overarching principle of these guidelines is to produce a valuation that represents a fair and accurate estimate of the value of our investments or the price that would be received for our investments in an arm s-length transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller in possession of all material information about our investments. These valuation guidelines are largely based upon standard industry practices used by private, open-end real estate funds and other public, non-listed REITs, and are administered by the Adviser. 
 As a public company, we are required to issue financial statements based on historical cost in accordance with GAAP, which are subject to an independent audit. To calculate our NAV for purposes of establishing a purchase and repurchase price for our shares, we have adopted a model, as explained below, that adjusts the value of our assets from historical cost to fair value in accordance with the GAAP principles set forth in FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. However, our valuation procedures and our NAV are not subject to GAAP and are not subject to independent audit. Our NAV may differ from equity reflected on our audited financial statements, even if we are required to adopt a fair value basis of accounting for GAAP financial statement purposes in the future. Because these fair value calculations involve significant professional judgment in the application of both observable and unobservable attributes, the calculated fair value of our assets may differ from their actual realizable value or future fair value. While we believe our NAV calculation methodologies are consistent with standard industry practices, there is no rule or regulation that requires that we calculate NAV in a certain way. As a result, other public, non-listed REITs may use different methodologies or assumptions to determine NAV. 
 45 

The following valuation methods are used for purposes of calculating our NAV: 
 Investments in real property are valued by our independent valuation advisor, and independent third-party appraisal firms using the income approach s discounted cash flow method. The discounted cash flow method takes into consideration all contractual rent payments over the life of the lease term offset by any capitalized expenditures. Our independent valuation advisor and independent third-party appraisers may supplement the discounted cash flow analysis with a sales comparison approach and the income approach s direct capitalization method, but typically reconcile exclusively to the discounted cash flow method. 

Investments in real estate debt are valued by an independent debt valuation services firm using the discounted cash flow method. Our independent debt valuation services firm calculates the fair value of loans by considering all relevant calculations and scenarios that a market participant would consider in evaluating the financial instrument. Most loans held as an investment are valued by discounting debt service cash flows using a market yield. 

Investments in real estate-related and other securities consists of an investment in U.S. Treasury bills. We classify real estate-related and other securities as trading securities which the Adviser generally values on the basis of publicly available market quotations or at fair value determined in accordance with GAAP. We generally determine the fair value of our investments in real estate-related and other securities by utilizing third-party service providers whenever available. 

Liabilities include the fees payable to the Adviser and the Dealer Manager, accounts payable, accrued operating expenses, property-level mortgages, the Repurchase Facility, any portfolio-level credit facilities and other liabilities, where applicable. Other than property-level mortgages and the Repurchase Facility, we include the cost basis of our liabilities as part of NAV, which approximates fair value. These carrying amounts are meant to reasonably approximate fair value due to the liquid and short-term nature of the instruments. We include as part of NAV the fair value of our property-level mortgages and Repurchase Facility, which are valued monthly by an independent valuation services firm. For most loans valued from the borrower s perspective, our independent debt valuation services firm utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis in evaluating its fair value conclusions. Additional inputs or adjustments to fair value conclusions may be applicable based on observations of market participant behavior. 

At the beginning of each calendar year, the Adviser develops a valuation plan with the objective of having each of our operating properties appraised each quarter, except for newly acquired properties as described below. Each operating property is appraised by an independent third-party appraisal firm other than our independent valuation advisor at least annually, and our independent valuation advisor performs the appraisal for each property that is not subject to such an independent third-party appraisal during any given fiscal quarter for each of the other three fiscal quarters. Our independent valuation advisor and the other independent third-party appraisal firms will take into account customary and accepted financial and commercial procedures and considerations as they deem relevant, which may include, the review of documents, materials and information relevant to valuing the property that are provided by the Adviser, such as (i) historical or forecasted operating revenues and expenses of the property; (ii) lease agreements on the property; (iii) the revenues and expenses of the property; (iv) information regarding recent or planned estimated capital expenditures; and (v) any other information relevant to valuing the real estate property. Appraisals are performed in accordance with the Code of Ethics and the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practices, the real estate appraisal industry standards created by The Appraisal Foundation, or the similar industry standard for the country where the property appraisal is conducted. Each appraisal must be reviewed, approved and signed by an individual with the professional designation of MAI (Member of the Appraisal Institute) or similar designation or, for international appraisals, a public or other certified expert for real estate valuations. Upon conclusion of the appraisal, our independent valuation advisor or the independent third-party appraisal firm prepares a written report with an estimated gross fair value of the property. Any appraisal provided by a firm other than our independent valuation advisor is performed in accordance with our valuation guidelines and is not considered in the Adviser s valuation of the applicable property until our independent valuation advisor has confirmed the reasonableness of such appraisal. 
 In accordance with the valuation guidelines, our fund administrator calculates our NAV per share for each class of our common stock as of the last calendar day of each month, using a process that reflects several components (each as described above), including the estimated fair value of (1) each of our properties based upon individual appraisal reports provided quarterly by third-party independent valuation firms or our independent valuation advisor, (2) our real estate-related assets for which third-party market quotes are available, (3) our other real estate-related assets, if any, and (4) our other assets and liabilities. The NAV per share for the share classes we are offering to the public may differ because stockholder servicing fees, management fees and the performance participation allocable to a specific class of shares are only included in the NAV calculation for that class. 
 46 

At the end of each month, before taking into consideration additional issuances of shares of capital stock, share repurchases or class-specific expense accruals for that month, any change in our aggregate NAV (whether an increase or decrease) is allocated among each class of shares based on each class s relative percentage of the previous aggregate NAV plus issuances of shares that were effective on the first calendar day of such month. The NAV calculation is available generally within 15 calendar days after the end of the applicable month. Changes in our monthly NAV include accruals of our net portfolio income, interest expense, the management fee, any accrued performance participation, distributions, unrealized/realized gains and losses on assets, any applicable organization and offering costs and any expense reimbursements. Changes in our monthly NAV also include material non-recurring events, such as capital expenditures and material property acquisitions and dispositions occurring during the month. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Adviser may in its discretion consider material market data and other information that becomes available after the end of the applicable month in valuing our assets and liabilities and calculating our NAV for a particular month. On an ongoing basis, the Adviser will adjust the accruals to reflect actual operating results and the outstanding receivable, payable and other account balances resulting from the accumulation of monthly accruals for which financial information is available. 
 The Adviser advanced our organization and offering expenses on our behalf (other than upfront selling commissions, dealer manager fees and stockholder servicing fees) through July 22, 2024, which marked the second anniversary of the commencement of the Offering. On such date, we began reimbursing the Adviser for all such advanced costs ratably over a period that will continue until 60 months following such date. For purposes of calculating our NAV, the organization and offering expenses paid by the Adviser through July 22, 2024 will not be recognized as expenses, or as a component of equity and reflected in our NAV, until we reimburse the Adviser for these expenses. In addition, the operating expenses paid by the Adviser through the earlier of (i) the first date that our NAV reaches 500 million and (ii) December 31, 2024 will not be recognized as expenses and reflected in our NAV, until we reimburse the Adviser for these expenses. 
 Following the aggregation of the net asset values of our investments, the addition of any other assets (such as cash on hand) and the deduction of any other liabilities, our fund administrator incorporates any class-specific adjustments to our NAV, including additional issuances and repurchases of our common stock and accruals of class-specific stockholder servicing fees, management fees and any accrued performance participation. For each applicable class of shares, each of the stockholder servicing fee and the management fee is calculated as a percentage of the aggregate NAV for such class of shares. At the close of business on the record date for any declared distribution, our NAV for each class will be reduced to reflect the accrual of our liability to pay any distribution to our stockholders of record of such class. NAV per share for each class is calculated by dividing such class s NAV at the end of each month by the number of shares outstanding for that class at the end of such month. 
 47 

We calculate NAV per share in accordance with the valuation guidelines that have been approved by our board of directors. We believe our NAV is a meaningful supplemental non-GAAP operating metric. The following table provides a breakdown of the major components of our NAV as of September 30, 2024 and shares in thousands):

(1) Stockholder servicing fees only apply to Class D, Class S, Class T and Class Y shares. For purposes of NAV, we recognize the stockholder servicing fee as a reduction to our NAV on a monthly basis as such fee is paid. Under GAAP, we accrue the lifetime cost of the stockholder servicing fee as an offering cost at the time we sell Class D, Class S, Class T and Class Y shares. The stockholder servicing fee on Class D shares was waived as of September 30, 2024, and the NAV attributable to current holders of Class D shares will not be included in the computation of stockholder servicing fees charged on Class D shares in perpetuity. As of September 30, 2024, we had accrued under GAAP 1.0 million of stockholder servicing fees. 
 (2) Represents Class E shares and Class E units in the Operating Partnership held by the Adviser that are mandatorily redeemable and only subject to delays to the continuous obligation to ultimately redeem the Class E shares and units once sufficient availability exists under the share repurchase agreements. Therefore, the Class E shares and Class E units held by JPMIM are classified as a liability pursuant to Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities From Equity and are presented as mandatorily redeemable instruments at the initial funding amount received, which is equivalent to fair value at the issuance dates. Subsequently, the Mandatorily Redeemable Instruments are carried at their cash redemption value as if the shares and units were repurchased or redeemable at the reporting date, which equals NAV per Class E share and Class E unit of 10.93.

On such date, we began reimbursing the Adviser for all such advanced costs ratably over a period that will continue until 60 months following such date. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reimbursed 0.3 million to the Adviser. In addition, the Adviser has agreed to advance on our behalf certain of our operating expenses through the earlier of (i) the first date that our NAV reaches 500 million and (ii) December 31, 2024 at which point we will reimburse the Adviser for all such advanced expenses ratably over the 60 months following such date. Under GAAP, organization costs are expensed as incurred and offering costs are charged to equity as such amounts are incurred. For the purposes of calculating NAV, such costs will be recognized as a reduction to NAV as they are reimbursed ratably over the respective 60-month reimbursement periods. 
 (2) Stockholder servicing fees only apply to Class D, Class S, Class T and Class Y shares. For purposes of NAV, we recognize the stockholder servicing fee as a reduction to our NAV on a monthly basis as such fee is paid. Under GAAP, we accrue the lifetime cost of the stockholder servicing fee as an offering cost at the time we sell Class D, Class S, Class T and Class Y shares. The stockholder servicing fee on Class D shares was waived as of September 30, 2024, and the NAV attributable to current holders of Class D shares will not be included in the computation of stockholder servicing fees charged on Class D shares in perpetuity. 
 (3) Our investments in real estate are presented at historical cost in our GAAP consolidated financial statements. Additionally, our mortgage notes and the Repurchase Facility ("Borrowings") are presented at their carrying values in our consolidated financial statements. As such, any changes in the fair market values of our investments in real estate or our Borrowings are not included in our GAAP results. For purposes of determining our NAV, our investments in real estate and our Borrowings are recorded at fair value. 
 (4) In accordance with GAAP, we depreciate our investments in real estate and amortize certain other assets and liabilities. Such depreciation and amortization is not recorded for purposes of determining our NAV. 
 (5) We record straight-line rent in accordance with GAAP. Any resulting straight-line rent receivable or liability is excluded for purposes of determining our NAV. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with GAAP involves significant judgments and assumptions and requires estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. These judgments will affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported in our financial statements. 
 Purchase price allocation of acquired investments in real estate 
 Upon the acquisition of a property, we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities (including land, buildings, tenant improvements, above-market and below-market leases, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities) and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities on a relative fair value basis in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations. All expenses related to the acquisition are capitalized and allocated among the identified assets. Generally, the most significant portion of the allocation is to the building and land and requires the use of market-based estimates and assumptions. 
 We assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and/or capitalization rates, as well as other available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors, including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. 
 49 

Acquired above-market and below-market leases are recorded at their fair values (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (2) management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed-rate renewal options for below-market leases. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease. Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses. A change in any of the assumptions above, which are subjective, could have a material impact on our results of operations. 
 The allocation of the purchase price directly affects the following in our consolidated financial statements: 
 the amount of purchase price allocated to the various tangible and intangible assets and liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets; 

the amounts allocated to above-market and below-market leases are amortized to rental income over the remaining non-cancelable terms of the respective leases. The amounts allocated to all other tangible and intangible assets are amortized to depreciation or amortization expense. Thus, depending on the amounts allocated between land and depreciable assets, changes in the purchase price allocation among our assets could have a material impact on our net income; and 

the period of time over which tangible and intangible assets are depreciated varies greatly, and thus, changes in the amounts allocated to these assets will have a direct impact on our results of operations. Intangible assets are generally amortized over the respective lives of the leases. Also, we depreciate our buildings over a maximum of 40 years, but do not depreciate our land. These differences in timing could have a material impact on our results of operations. 

Mandatorily Redeemable Instruments 
 We report our Mandatorily Redeemable Instruments as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at JPMIM s cash redemption value. JPMIM s cash redemption value is determined based on our NAV per Class E share or Class E unit as of our balance sheet date. For purposes of determining our NAV, our investments in real estate are recorded at fair value based on independent third-party valuations prepared by licensed appraisers in accordance with standard industry practice or in the case of real estate-related and other securities using readily available actively quoted prices. 
 These fair value estimates of our investments in real estate are particularly important as they are used for the calculation of NAV, which determines the adjustment to the carrying value of our Mandatorily Redeemable Instruments. Significant differences in the fair value of our Mandatorily Redeemable Instruments may result from changes in market conditions that cause our NAV, and thus JPMIM s redemption value, to increase or decrease during the period which is recorded as a component of mandatorily redeemable instruments interest costs on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 Investments in real estate debt 
 Our investments in real estate debt consist of investments in the Mezzanine Loan and the Commercial Mortgage Loan. Our investments in real estate debt are carried at fair value as we elected the fair value option. Investments with readily available, actively quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment used in measuring fair value. 
 Our real estate debt investments are unlikely to have readily available market quotations. As such, we determine fair value by utilizing or reviewing certain of the following (i) market yield data, (ii) discounted cash flow modeling, (iii) collateral asset performance, (iv) local or macro real estate performance, (v) capital market conditions, (vi) debt yield or loan-to-value ratios and (vii) borrower financial condition and performance. We classify these investments as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy. Judgments used to determine the fair values of Level 3 instruments are more significant than those required when determining the fair value of instruments classified as Level 1 or 2 due to the inherent uncertainty of the estimates and judgments used. These values may differ materially from the values that would have been used had a ready market for these investments existed. External factors may cause those values and the values of those investments for which readily observable inputs exist, to increase or decrease over time, impacting the value of our investment which is recorded in income from investments in real estate debt on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 Ite m 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Interest rate risk 
 We are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to our variable-rate indebtedness, where an increase in interest rates would directly result in higher interest expense costs. We may seek to manage or mitigate our exposure to interest risk through interest rate protection agreements to fix or cap a portion of our variable rate debt. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding principal balance of our variable rate indebtedness was 56.8 million. 
 Certain of our mortgage loans and other indebtedness are variable rate and indexed to SOFR. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 10 increase in SOFR would have resulted in increased interest expense of 0.001 million. We have executed interest rate swaps and caps with an aggregate notional amount of 10.0 million as of September 30, 2024, to hedge the risk of increasing interest rates. 
 We have invested a portion of our portfolio in floating-rate investments in real estate debt and real estate-related and other securities and intend to invest in both fixed- and floating-rate real estate debt investments and securities in the future. On floating-rate investments in real estate debt and real estate-related and other securities, our net income will increase or decrease depending on interest rate movements. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 10 decrease in the Reference Rate would have resulted in decreased interest income from our floating-rate investments in real estate debt of 0.05 million and 0.1 million, respectively. Additionally, interest rate movement can impact the valuation of real estate debt and real estate-related and other securities depending on various aspects of the instrument, including the credit rating, duration and structure of the interest rate payments. 
 Credit risk 
 We are exposed to credit risk with respect to the tenants that occupy properties we own. To mitigate this risk, we undertake a credit evaluation of major tenants prior to making an investment. This analysis includes extensive due diligence of a potential tenant s creditworthiness and business, as well as an assessment of the strategic importance of the property to the tenant s core business operations. 
 Additionally, we are exposed to credit risk in the real estate-related debt investments that we make with respect to a borrower s ability to make required interest and principal payments on scheduled due dates. We manage this risk by conducting a credit analysis prior to making an investment and by actively monitoring our portfolio and the underlying credit quality. In addition, we re-evaluate the credit risk inherent in our investments on a regular basis under fundamental considerations such as gross domestic product, unemployment, interest rates, retail sales, store closing/openings, corporate earnings, housing inventory, affordability and regional home price trends. 
 Finally, we may be exposed to counterparty credit risk under the terms of a derivative contract. If the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty will owe us, which creates credit risk for us. If the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, we will owe the counterparty and, therefore, do not have credit risk. We will seek to minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high-quality counterparties.

Real estate market value risk 
 Real estate property values are subject to volatility and may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including national, regional and local economic conditions (which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors); local real estate conditions; changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments; construction quality, age and design; demographic factors; and retroactive changes to building or similar codes. 
 Ite m 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q was made under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ). Based upon this evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (a) are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by SEC rules and forms and (b) include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Ite m 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 The Company is not currently involved in any material litigation. 
 Ite m 1A. Risk Factors. 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 ("2023 Form 10-K") and Part I, Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2024 2024 Q2 Form 10-Q ). The risks described in our 2023 Form 10-K and 2024 Q2 Form 10-Q are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K and our 2024 Q2 Form 10-Q. 
 Ite m 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 Unregistered sales of equity securities 
 All sales of unregistered securities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 were previously disclosed. 
 Share repurchase plan 
 We adopted a share repurchase plan, whereby on a monthly basis, stockholders may request that we repurchase all or any portion of their shares. We may choose to repurchase all, some or none of the shares that have been requested to be repurchased at the end of any particular month, in our discretion, subject to any limitations in the share repurchase plan. The aggregate NAV of total repurchases of our shares is limited to no more than 2 of our aggregate NAV per month (measured using the aggregate NAV attributable to stockholders at the end of the immediately preceding month) and 5 of our aggregate NAV per calendar quarter (measured using the average aggregate NAV attributable to stockholders at the end of the immediately preceding three months). Shares are repurchased at a price equal to the transaction price on the applicable repurchase date, subject to any early repurchase deduction. Shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year are repurchased at 98 of the transaction price. If we determine to repurchase some but not all of the shares submitted for repurchase during any month, shares submitted for repurchase during such month will be repurchased on a pro rata basis based on the amount requested after we have repurchased all shares for which repurchase was requested due to death or disability and other limited exceptions. All unsatisfied repurchase requests must be resubmitted after the start of the next month or quarter, or upon the recommencement of the share repurchase plan, as applicable. Due to the illiquid nature of investments in real estate, we may not have sufficient liquid resources to fund repurchase requests and have established limitations on the amount of funds we may use for repurchase during any calendar month and quarter. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased shares of our common stock in the following amounts, which represented all of the share repurchase requests received for the same period.

As of September 30, 2024, we had accrued under GAAP 1.0 million of stockholder servicing fees. The stockholder servicing fee on Class D shares has been waived through September 30, 2024, and the NAV attributable to current stockholders of Class D shares will not be included in the computation of stockholder servicing fees charged on Class D shares in perpetuity. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had primarily used the net proceeds from the unregistered sales along with the proceeds received from the Offering toward the acquisition of 372.2 million of real estate, investments in real estate debt of 79.2 million and investments of 0.5 million in real estate-related and other securities. In addition to the net proceeds from the Offering, we financed our investments with 21.3 million of financing from the Credit Facility, which was subsequently repaid in full, 123.6 million from mortgage notes, including an assumed loan of 28.2 million and 62.4 million from the Repurchase Facility.
