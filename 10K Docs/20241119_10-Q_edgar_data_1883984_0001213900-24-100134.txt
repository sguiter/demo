CAUTIONARY
STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

Certain
statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are subject to the safe harbor created thereby. All statements contained in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q other than statements of historical facts, including statements regarding our future results of operations
and financial position, our business strategy and plans and our objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. The
words believe, may, will, estimate, continue, anticipate, 
 intend, expect and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based
these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we
believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and
objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including
those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, in
 Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in any subsequent filing we make with the SEC,
as well as in any documents incorporated by reference that describe risks and factors that could cause results to differ materially from
those projected in these forward-looking statements. 

Moreover,
we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management
to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of
factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. Considering
these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the future events and trends discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may not occur
and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. 

Although
we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels
of activity, performance, achievements or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will occur. We are under
no duty to update any of these forward-looking statements after completion of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to confirm these statements
to actual results or revised expectations.

ALTERNUS
CLEAN ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES
TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

shares of common stock
of Clean Earth, par value per share, to AEG, and AEG transferred to Clean Earth, and Clean Earth received from AEG, all of the
issued and outstanding equity interests in the Acquired Subsidiaries (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) (the Equity
Exchange, and together with the other transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, the Business Combination ).
In connection with the Closing, the Company changed its name from Clean Earth Acquisition Corp. to Alternus Clean Energy, Inc. 

Clean
Earth s only pre-combination assets were cash and investments, and the SPAC did not meet the definition of a business in accordance
with U.S. GAAP. Therefore, the substance of the transaction was a recapitalization of the target (AEG) rather than a business combination
or an asset acquisition. In such a situation, the transaction is accounted for as though the target issued its equity for the net assets
of the SPAC and, since a business combination has not occurred, no goodwill or intangible assets would be recorded. As such, AEG is considered
the accounting acquirer, and these consolidated financial statements represent a continuation of AEG s financial statements. The
assets and liabilities of AEG are presented at their historical carrying values.

million and a net loss of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company
had total shareholders equity/(deficit) of million as of September 30, 2024 and million as of December 31, 2023.
 thousand of unrestricted cash on hand as of September 30, 2024 and million as of December 31, 2023. 

Our
operating revenues are insufficient to fund our operations, and our assets already are pledged to secure our indebtedness to various
third party secured creditors, respectively. The unavailability of additional financing could require us to delay, scale back, or terminate
our acquisition efforts as well as our own business activities, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company and its viability
and prospects. 

The
terms of our indebtedness, including the covenants and the dates on which principal and interest payments on our indebtedness are due,
increases the risk that we will be unable to continue as a going concern. To continue as a going concern over the next twelve months,
we must make payments on our debt as they come due and comply with the covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness or, if
we fail to do so, to (i) negotiate and obtain waivers of or forbearances with respect to any defaults that occur with respect to our
indebtedness, (ii) amend, replace, refinance, or restructure any or all of the agreements governing our indebtedness, and/or (iii) otherwise
secure additional capital. However, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in accomplishing any of these plans. 

On October 3, 2024, because Solis was unable to fully repay the Solis
Bonds, the Company sold Solis and its subsidiaries in Romania to Solis Trustee Special Vehicle Limited, the Solis Bondholders ownership
vehicle, for in accordance with the terms of the Solis Bonds, as amended. As a result of the sale, the Company eliminated approximately
 million in debt and payables related to Solis activities and improved shareholders equity by approximately million. Solis accounted
for of group revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Solis bondholders continue to hold a preference share in an Alternus
holding company which holds certain development projects in Spain and Italy. The preference share gives the bondholders the right on any
distributions up to million, and such assets will be divested to ensure repayment of up to million should it not be
fully repaid by the Maturity Date. 

On
March 20, 2024, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC therein stating that for the
32 consecutive business day period between February 2, 2024 through March 19, 2024, the Common Stock had not maintained a minimum closing
bid price of per share required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the
 Bid Price Rule ). Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company was provided an initial period of 180 calendar
days, or until September 16, 2024 (the Compliance Period ), to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule. The Company, on
September 19, 2024, received a delist determination letter from the Staff advising the Company that the Staff had determined that the
Company did not meet the eligibility for a second 180-day compliance period. The Company further to same, requested an appeal of the
Staff s determination on September 26, 2024, and recently effected the 2024 Reverse Stock Split on October 11, 2024. The Company
regained compliance with the Bid Price Rule on October 28, 2024, but there can be no assurance that the Company will maintain compliance
with any of the other Nasdaq continued listing requirements. 

8 

million required for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq listing rule 5550(b)(2).
The notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company s common stock, and the Company s common stock continues
to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol ALCE. In accordance with Nasdaq listing rule 5810(c)(3)(C), the
Company has 180 calendar days, or until November 4, 2024, to regain compliance. The notice states that to regain compliance, the Company s
MVLS must close at million or more for a minimum of ten consecutive business days (or such longer period of time as the Nasdaq staff
may require in some circumstances, but generally not more than 20 consecutive business days) during the compliance period ending November
4, 2024. The Company had not regained compliance by November 4, 2024, and the Nasdaq staff provided written notice to the Company that
its securities are subject to delisting. See the Subsequent Events Footnote for more information. While the Company is exercising diligent
efforts to maintain the listing of its common stock on Nasdaq, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain or maintain
compliance with Nasdaq listing standards. 

The
Company is currently working on several processes to address the going concern issue. The Company is working with shareholders, investment
funds and multiple global banks and funds to secure necessary project financing to execute our transatlantic business plan.

to any other fees paid to the lender. The issuance of a warrant to the lender further increases the discount on this debt. As the Convertible
Notes were issued at a discount, and not a premium, they are eligible for the fair value option. Management identified various features
that would likely require separate accounting as derivatives if the fair value option were not taken; specifically, the various features
that allow the Company or counterparty to settle the debt for a quantity of shares that is calculated as a percentage of VWAP. Even if
no bifurcated features were identified, the Company would still be eligible for the fair value option under ASC 825. Accordingly, the

reportable segments that consist of PV operations by geographical region, U.S. Operations and European Operations. European
operations represent our most significant business. The Chief Operating Decision-Maker (CODM) is the CEO. 

The
European Segment derives revenues from three sources, Country Renewable Programs, Green Certificates and Long-term Offtake Agreements.
The US Segment revenues are derived from Long-term Offtake Agreements. 

In
evaluating financial performance, we focus on EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, as a segment s measure of profit or loss. EBITDA is defined
as earnings before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization. The Company uses EBITDA because management believes
that it can be a useful financial metric in understanding the Company s earnings from operations. EBITDA is not a measure of the
Company s financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other performance
measure derived in accordance with GAAP. As a trans-Atlantic independent solar power provider, we evaluate many of our capital expenditure
decisions at a regional level. Accordingly, expenditures on property, plant and equipment and associated debt by segment are presented.

The
Company uses annual recurring revenues as a key metric in its financial management information and believes this method better reflects
the long-term stability of operations into the future. Annual recurring revenues are defined as the estimated future revenue generated
by operating solar parks based on the remaining term, the price received per mega-watt hour (MWh) of energy produced multiplied by the
estimated production from each solar park over a full year of operation. It should be noted that the actual revenues reported by the
Company in a particular year may be lower than the annual recurring revenues because not all parks may be revenue generating for the
full year in their first year of operation. The Company must also account for the timing of acquisitions that take place throughout the
financial year. 

Impacts
of the Ukraine/Russia conflict 

The
geopolitical situation in Eastern Europe intensified on February 24, 2022, with Russia s invasion of Ukraine. The war between the
two countries continues to evolve as military activity proceeds and additional sanctions are imposed. In addition to the human toll and
impact of the events on entities that have operations in Russia, Ukraine, or neighboring countries (e.g., Belarus, Poland, Romania) or
that conduct business with their counterparties, the war is increasingly affecting economic and global financial markets and exacerbating
ongoing economic challenges, including issues such as rising inflation and global supply-chain disruption. These events have not impacted
the physical operations of our facilities in Romania. However, the Company has seen fluctuations in energy rates due to inflation, increased
interest rates, and other macro-economic factors. 

Known
trends or Uncertainties 

The
Company has a working capital deficiency and negative equity, and management has determined there is doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern, if planned financing and/or equity raises do not complete. Refer to Footnote 2 of the accompanying
financial statements. 

The
Company is currently working on several processes to address the going concern issue. We are working with multiple global banks and funds
to secure the necessary corporate and project level financing to execute our transatlantic business plan. 

Competitive
Strengths 

The
Company believes that the following competitive strengths contribute to its success and differentiate the Company from its competitors: 

The
 Company is an Independent Power Producer and is comfortable operating across all aspects of the solar PV value chain from development
 through long-term operational ownership, compared to only buying operating parks where the high levels of competition from investment
 companies tend to be. Management believes that the Company s flexibility in this regard makes it a more attractive partner
 to local developers who benefit from having a single trusted and flexible customer that allows them to plan effectively and grow
 faster; 

The
 Company s history of identifying and entering new solar PV markets coupled with its on-the-ground capabilities and transatlantic
 platform gives the Company potential competitive advantages in developing and operating solar parks; 

The
 Company s existing pipeline of owned and contracted solar PV projects provides it with clear and actionable opportunities as
 well as the ability to cultivate power generation and earnings as these are required; 

The
 Company is technology and supplier agnostic and as such has the flexibility to choose from a broad range of leading manufacturers,
 operations and maintenance (O M) experts, top tier suppliers, and engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) vendors across
 the globe and can benefit from falling component and service costs; and 

The
 Company is led by a highly experienced management team and has strong, localized execution capabilities across all key functions
 and locations. 

38 

Vision
and Strategy 

The
Company aims to become one of the leading producers of clean energy in Europe and the U.S. by 2030 and to have commenced delivery of
24/7 clean energy to national power grids. The Company s business strategy of developing to own and operate a diverse portfolio
of solar PV assets that generate stable long-term incomes, in countries which currently have unprecedented positive market forces, positions
us for sustained growth in the years to come. 

To
achieve its goals, the Company intends to pursue the following strategies: 

Continue
 our growth strategy which targets acquiring independent solar PV projects that are either in development, in construction, newly
 installed or already operational, in order to build a diversified portfolio across multiple geographies; 

Developer
 and Agent Relationships: long-term relationships with high-quality developer partners, both local and international, can reduce competition
 in acquisition pricing and provide the Company with exclusive rights to projects at varying stages. Additionally, the Company works
 with established agents across Europe and the United States. Working with these groups provides the Company with an understanding
 of the market and in some cases enables it to contract projects at the pre-market level. This allows the Company to build a structured
 pipeline of projects in each country where it currently operates or intends to operate; 

Expand
 our transatlantic IPP portfolio in locations that deliver higher yields for lowest equity deployed and attractive returns on investments,
 and increase and optimize the Company s long-term recurring revenue and cash flows; 

Long-term
 off-take contracts combined with the Company s efficient operations are expected to provide robust and predictable cash flows
 from projects and allow for high leverage capacity and flexibility of debt structuring. Our strategy is to reinvest the project cash
 flows into additional solar PV projects to provide non-dilutive capital for Alternus to self-fund future growth; 

Optimization
 of financing sources to support long-term growth and profitability in a cost-efficient manner; 

As
 a renewable energy company, we are committed to growing our portfolio of clean energy parks in the most sustainable way possible.
 The Company is highly aware and conscious of the ever growing need to mitigate the effects of climate change, which is evident by
 its core strategy. As the Company grows, it intends to establish a formal sustainability policy framework in order to ensure that
 all project development is carried out in a sustainable manner mitigating any potential localized environmental impacts identified
 during the development, construction and operational process. 

Given
the long-term nature of our business, the Company does not operate its business on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but rather, with long-term
shareholder value creation as a priority. The Company aims to maximize return for its shareholders by originating from the ground up
and/or acquiring projects during the development cycle, installation stage, or already operational. 

We
intend that the parks we own and operate will have a positive cash flow with long-term income streams at the lowest possible risk. To
this end we use Levelized Cost of Energy LCOE as a key criterion to ranking the projects we consider for development
and/or acquisition. The LCOE calculates the total cost of ownership of the parks over their expected life reflected as a rate per megawatt
hour (MWh). Once the income rates for the selected projects are higher than this rate, the project will be profitable for its full life,
including initial capex costs. The Company will continue to operate with this priority as we continue to invest in internal infrastructure
and additional solar PV power plants to increase installed power and resultant stable long-term revenue streams.

Key
Factors that Significantly Affect Company Results of Operations and Business 

The
Company expects the following factors will affect its results of operations inflation and energy rate fluctuations. 

Offtake
Contracts 

Company
revenue is primarily a function of the volume of electricity generated and sold by its renewable energy facilities as well as, where
applicable, the sale of green energy certificates and other environmental attributes related to energy generation. The Company s
current portfolio of renewable energy facilities is generally contracted under long-term FIT programs or PPAs with investment grade counterparties.
As of September 30, 2024, the average remaining life of its FITs and PPAs was 27.05 years. Pricing of the electricity sold under these
FITs and PPAs is generally fixed for the duration of the contract, although some of its PPAs have price escalators based on an index
(such as the consumer price index) or other rates specified in the applicable PPA. 

Project
Operations and Generation Availability 

The
Company revenue is a function of the volume of electricity generated and sold by Company renewable energy facilities. The volume of electricity
generated and sold by the Company s renewable energy facilities during a particular period is impacted by the number of facilities
that have achieved commercial operations, as well as both scheduled and unexpected repair and maintenance required to keep its facilities
operational. 

The
costs the Company incurs to operate, maintain, and manage renewable energy facilities also affect the results of operations. Equipment
performance represents the primary factor affecting the Company s operating results because equipment downtime impacts the volume
of the electricity that the Company can generate from its renewable energy facilities. The volume of electricity generated and sold by
the Company s facilities will also be negatively impacted if any facilities experience higher than normal downtime as a result
of equipment failures, electrical grid disruption or curtailment, weather disruptions, or other events beyond the Company s control. 

Seasonality
and Resource Variability 

The
amount of electricity produced and revenues generated by the Company s solar generation facilities is dependent in part on the
amount of sunlight, or irradiation, where the assets are located. As shorter daylight hours in winter months result in less irradiation,
the electricity generated by these facilities will vary depending on the season. Irradiation can also be variable at a particular location
from period to period due to weather or other meteorological patterns, which can affect operating results. As most of the Company s
solar power plants are in the Northern Hemisphere, the Company expects its current solar portfolio s power generation to be at
its lowest during the first and fourth quarters of each year. Therefore, the Company expects first and fourth quarter solar revenue to
be lower than in other quarters. As a result, on average, each solar park generates approximately 15 of its annual revenues in Q1 every
year, 37 in each of Q2 and Q3, and the remaining 11 in Q4. The Company s costs are relatively flat over the year, and so the
Company will always report lower profits in Q1 and Q4 as compared to the middle of the year. 

Interest
Rates on Company Debt 

Interest
rates on the Company s senior debt are mostly variable for the full term of the finance at interest rates ranging from 6 to 30 .
The relative certainty of cash flows provides sufficient coverage ratios. 

In
addition to the project specific senior debt, the Company uses a small number of promissory notes in order to reduce, and in some cases
eliminate, the requirement for the Company to provide equity in the acquisition of the projects. As of September 30, 2024, 84.4 of the
Company s total liabilities were project-related debt. 

Cash
Distribution Restrictions 

In
certain cases, the Company, through its subsidiaries, obtain project-level or other limited or non-recourse financing for Company renewable
energy facilities which may limit these subsidiaries ability to distribute funds to the Company for corporate operational costs.
These limitations typically require that the project-level cash is used to meet debt obligations and fund operating reserves of the operating
subsidiary. These financing arrangements also generally limit the Company s ability to distribute funds generated from the projects
if defaults have occurred or would occur with the giving of notice or the lapse of time, or both. 

40 

Renewable
Energy Facility Acquisitions and Investments 

The
Company s long-term growth strategy is dependent on its ability to acquire additional renewable power generation assets. This growth
is expected to be comprised of additional acquisitions across the Company s scope of operations both in its current focus countries
and new countries. Our operating revenues are insufficient to fund our operations, and our assets already are pledged to secure our indebtedness
to various third party secured creditors, respectively. The unavailability of additional financing could require us to delay, scale back,
or terminate our acquisition efforts as well as our own business activities, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company
and its viability and prospects. 

Management
believes renewable power has been one of the fastest growing sources of electricity generation globally over the past decade. The Company
expects the renewable energy generation segment to continue to offer growth opportunities driven by: 

The
 continued reduction in the cost of solar and other renewable energy technologies, which the
 Company believes will lead to grid parity in an increasing number of markets; 

Distribution
 charges and the effects of an aging transmission infrastructure, which enable renewable energy generation sources located at a customer s
 site, or distributed generation, to be more competitive with, or cheaper than, grid-supplied electricity; 

The
 replacement of aging and conventional power generation facilities in the face of increasing industry challenges, such as regulatory
 barriers, increasing costs of and difficulties in obtaining and maintaining applicable permits, and the decommissioning of certain
 types of conventional power generation facilities, such as coal and nuclear facilities; 

The
 ability to couple renewable energy generation with other forms of power generation and/or storage, creating a hybrid energy solution
 capable of providing energy on a 24/7 basis while reducing the average cost of electricity obtained through the system; 

The
 desire of energy consumers to lock in long-term pricing for a reliable energy source; 

Renewable
 energy generation s ability to utilize freely available sources of fuel, thus avoiding the risks of price volatility and market
 disruptions associated with many conventional fuel sources; 

Environmental
 concerns over conventional power generation; and 

Government
 policies that encourage the development of renewable power, such as country, state or provincial renewable portfolio standard programs,
 which motivate utilities to procure electricity from renewable resources. 

Access
to Capital Markets 

The
Company s ability to acquire additional clean power generation assets and manage its other commitments will likely be dependent
on its ability to raise or borrow additional funds and access debt and equity capital markets, including the equity capital markets,
the corporate debt markets, and the project finance market for project-level debt. The Company accessed the capital markets several times
in 2022 and 2023, but not so far during 2024, in connection with long-term project debt, and corporate loans and equity. Limitations
on the Company s ability to access the corporate and project finance debt and equity capital markets in the future on terms that
are accretive to its existing cash flows would be expected to negatively affect its results of operations, business, and future growth. 

Foreign
Exchange 

The
Company s operating results are reported in United States (USD) Dollars. The Company s current project revenue and expenses
are generated in other currencies, including the Euro (EUR), and the Romanian Lei (RON). This mix may continue to change in the future
if the Company elects to alter the mix of its portfolio within its existing markets or elect to expand into new markets. In addition,
the Company s investments (including intercompany loans) in renewable energy facilities in foreign countries are exposed to foreign
currency fluctuations. As a result, the Company expects revenues and expenses will be exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations in local
currencies where the Company s renewable energy facilities are located. To the extent the Company does not hedge these exposures,
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could negatively impact profitability and financial position.

Key
Metrics 

Operating
Metrics 

The
Company regularly reviews several operating metrics to evaluate its performance, identify trends affecting its business, formulate financial
projections and make certain strategic decisions. The Company considers a solar park operating when it has achieved connection and begins
selling electricity to the energy grid. 

Operating
Nameplate capacity 

The
Company measures the electricity-generating production capacity of its renewable energy facilities in nameplate capacity. The Company
expresses nameplate capacity in direct current (DC), for all facilities. The size of the Company s renewable energy facilities
varies significantly among the assets comprising its portfolio. 

The
Company believes the combined nameplate capacity of its portfolio is indicative of its overall production capacity and period to period
comparisons of its nameplate capacity are indicative of the growth rate of its business. The production capacity listed below for Italy,
Poland, and the Netherlands reflect the actual production from those parks during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The parks
were sold on December 28, 2023, January 19, 2024, and February 21, 2024, respectively. The table below outlines the Company s operating
renewable energy facilities as of September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Revenue for continuing operations decreased by
 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily driven by the 1.2 million of
revenues generated in 2023 by the Italian parks which were sold in December 2023. 

Revenue for continuing operations decreased by
 2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily driven by the 2.9 million of
revenues generated in 2023 by the Italian parks which were sold in December 2023. This was offset by a 0.2 million increase in revenues
generated by US parks. All three US parks were operational for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to only two parks in
the same period in 2023. 

Revenue for discontinued operations decreased
by 5.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. All operating parks in Poland and the
Netherlands were sold on January 19, 2024 and February 21, 2024, respectively, resulting in a 3.5 million decrease in revenues. Romanian
revenues decreased by 1.5 million due to a lower volume of Green Certificates being sold in 2024 and lower energy rates obtained for
energy production in 2024 in Romania resulting in a 29 drop year-on-year. 

Revenue for discontinued operations decreased
by 13.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. All operating parks in Poland and the
Netherlands were sold on January 19, 2024 and February 21, 2024, respectively, resulting in a 9.7 million decrease in revenues. Romanian
revenues decreased by 3.8 million due to a lower volume of Green Certificates being sold in 2024 and lower energy rates obtained for

Cost
of Revenues 

The
Company capitalizes its equipment costs, development costs, engineering, and construction related costs that are deemed recoverable.
The Company s cost of revenues with regards to its solar parks is primarily a result of the asset management, operations, and maintenance,
as well as tax, insurance, and lease expenses. Certain economic incentive programs, such as FIT regimes, generally include mechanisms
that ratchet down incentives over time. As a result, the Company seeks to connect its solar parks to the local power grids and commence
operations in a timely manner to benefit from more favorable existing incentives. Therefore, the Company generally seeks to make capital
investments during times when incentives are most favorable. 

Cost
of revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:

Cost
of revenues for continuing operations decreased by 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period
in 2023 primarily driven by the decrease in costs for the Italian parks which were sold in December 2023. 

46 

Cost
of revenues for continuing operations decreased by 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period
in 2023 primarily driven by the decrease in costs for the Italian parks which were sold in December 2023. There was very little variance
in US costs year-on-year. 

Gross
margins were 49 of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 77 for the same period in 2023, mainly due to the
exclusion of Italian operating parks that were sold in December 2023. 

Cost
of revenues for discontinued operations decreased by 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same
period in 2023. All operating parks in Poland and the Netherlands were sold on January 19, 2024 and February 21, 2024, respectively,
resulting in a 1.2 million decrease in cost of revenues. Romanian parks had a 0.7 million increase in operational costs driven by higher
costs of energy acquisition for contracted revenues in the period. 

Cost
of revenues for discontinued operations decreased by 1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period
in 2023. All operating parks in Poland and the Netherlands were sold on January 19, 2024 and February 21, 2024, respectively, resulting
in a 3.2 million decrease in cost of revenues. Romanian parks had a 1.5 million increase in operational costs driven by higher costs
of energy acquisition for contracted revenues in the period. Approximately 40 of annual Romania revenue is currently under contract
at rates which are lower than the prevailing market rates.

Development cost for continuing operations increased
by 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to final work performed for projects
abandoned for the development of renewable energy projects in Spain and the US. 

Development cost increased by 0.4 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to final work performed for projects abandoned for the
development of renewable energy projects in Spain and the US. 

Development cost for discontinued operations decreased
by 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to final work performed for Solis
endeavors abandoned in 2023. 

The
Company depends heavily on government policies that support our business and enhance the economic feasibility of developing and operating
solar energy projects in regions in which we operate or plan to develop and operate renewable energy facilities. The Company can decide
to abandon a project if there is material change in budgetary constraints, political factors or otherwise, governments from time to time
may review their laws and policies that support renewable energy and consider actions that would make the laws and policies less conducive
to the development and operation of renewable energy facilities. Any reductions or modifications to, or the elimination of, governmental
incentives or policies that support renewable energy or the imposition of additional taxes or other assessments on renewable energy,
could result in, among other items, the lack of a satisfactory market for the development and/or financing of new renewable energy projects,
our abandoning the development of renewable energy projects, a loss of our investments in the projects, and reduced project returns,
any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Refer to
Footnote 17 to the accompanying financial statements for more detail of development cost.

Total other expenses for continuing operations
decreased by 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to a decrease in interest
expense paid on US loans. The Company recorded a 1.1 million positive movement in fair value on the convertible debt and private warrant
issued during the quarter. See Note 5 for additional details. 

Total other expenses for continuing operations
increased by 2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, due to a 2 million increase
in interest expense, a 0.5 million reduction in valuation on the Forward Purchase Agreement, a 0.9 million positive movement in fair
value on the convertible debt and private warrant issued, and a 0.9 million loss on issuance of convertible debt and private placement
warrants. This was partially offset by a 0.2 million gain recognized on the conversion of the Nordic ESG debt to shares in January 2024. 

Total
other expenses for discontinued operations decreased by 13.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and by 17.4 million

payment against the principal Bond balance. Additionally, Solis recognized a waiver fee of 11.2 million in 2023. 

Net
Loss 

Net loss for continuing operations increased
by 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This is primarily due a reduction
in revenues of 1.2 million and increase in SG A expenses of 0.6 million driven by additional costs associated with being listed
on Nasdaq, and development costs of 0.7 million. This was partially offset by a decrease in cost of revenues of 0.2 million, depreciation
of 0.4 million due to asset sales, interest expense of 0.2 million, and other expense of 1.1 million as described above. 

51 

Net loss for continuing operations increased

reduction in revenues and an increase in SG A expenses of 4.2 million due to costs associated with being listed on Nasdaq, interest
expense of 2 million, development costs of 0.4 million, and other expense of 2.3 million as described above. This was partially offset
by a decrease in cost of revenues of 0.7 million, and depreciation of 1.2 million. 

Net
loss for discontinued operations decreased by 10.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period
in 2023. This is primarily due to a decrease in revenues of 5 million, cost of revenues of 0.5 million, SG A expenses of 0.9 million,
depreciation of 0.7 million, interest expense of 2.1 million, other expense of 11.3 million, and tax expense of 0.2 million. This

Net
loss for discontinued operations decreased by 10.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period
in 2023. This is primarily due to a decrease in revenues of 13.5 million, cost of revenues of 1.7 million, SG A expenses of 0.9
million, depreciation of 2 million, development costs of 0.4 million, interest expense of 6.2 million, other expense of 11.4 million,
and tax expense of 0.2 million. This was offset by a gain of 2.2 million for the sale of the Poland and Rilland solar park in January

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Capital
Resources 

A
key element to the Company s financing strategy is to raise much of its debt in the form of project specific non-recourse borrowings
at its subsidiaries with investment grade metrics. Going forward, the Company intends to primarily finance acquisitions or growth capital
expenditures using long-term non-recourse debt that fully amortizes within the asset s contracted life, as well as retained cash
flows from operations and issuance of equity securities through public markets. 

The
following table summarizes certain financial measures that are not calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, along with
the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, for each period presented below. In addition to its results determined in accordance
with U.S. GAAP, the Company believes the following non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating its operating
performance. The Company uses the following non-U.S. GAAP financial information, collectively, to evaluate its ongoing
operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes.

Liquidity
Position 

Our
consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and for the year ended December 31, 2023 identifies
the existence of certain conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months from
the issuance of this report. Refer to Footnote 2 of the accompanying financial statements for more information. 

On
March 20, 2024, we received a letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC therein stating that
for the 32 consecutive business day period between February 2, 2024 through March 19, 2024, the Common Stock had not maintained a minimum
closing bid price of 1.00 per share required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2)
(the Bid Price Rule ). Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company was provided an initial period of 180
calendar days, or until September 16, 2024 (the Compliance Period ), to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule. The Company,
on September 19, 2024, received a delist determination letter from the Staff advising the Company that the Staff had determined that
the Company did not meet the eligibility for a second 180-day compliance period. The Company further to same, requested an appeal of
the Staff s determination on September 26, 2024, and recently effected the 2024 Reverse Stock Split on October 11, 2024. The Company
regained compliance with the Bid Price Rule on October 28, 2024, but there can be no assurance that the Company will maintain compliance
with any of the other Nasdaq continued listing requirements. 

On
May 6, 2024, we received a letter from the listing qualifications department staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market Nasdaq notifying the Company that for the last 30 consecutive business days, the Company s minimum Market Value of Listed Securities MVLS was below the minimum of 35 million required for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq listing rule 5550(b)(2).
The notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company s common stock, and the Company s common stock continues
to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol ALCE. In accordance with Nasdaq listing rule 5810(c)(3)(C), the
Company has 180 calendar days, or until November 4, 2024, to regain compliance. The notice states that to regain compliance, the Company s
MVLS must close at 35 million or more for a minimum of ten consecutive business days (or such longer period of time as the Nasdaq staff
may require in some circumstances, but generally not more than 20 consecutive business days) during the compliance period ending November
4, 2024. The Company believes that it can also regain compliance by meeting the continued listing standard of a minimum stockholders 
equity of at least 2.5 million. The Company had not regained compliance by November 4, 2024, and the Nasdaq staff provided written notice
to the Company that its securities are subject to delisting. See Subsequent Events Footnote for more information. While the Company is
exercising diligent efforts to maintain the listing of its common stock on Nasdaq, there can be no assurance that the Company will be
able to regain or maintain compliance with Nasdaq listing standards. 

The
Company is currently working on several processes to address the going concern issue. We are working with multiple global banks and funds
to secure the necessary project financing to execute our transatlantic business plan.

Net
Cash Used in Operating Activities 

Net cash used in continuing operating activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 decreased by 0.4 million. The increase of 7.7 million in 2024 was primarily
driven by an increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses, an increase in interest expense, an increase in other expenses
as described above, and a decrease in revenues in the first nine months of 2024. The remaining decrease was a result of the normal fluctuations
of receivables and payables over the normal course of business operations. 

Net
cash used in discontinued operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 decreased by 2.4 million.
This was a result of the normal fluctuations of receivables and payables over the normal course of business operations. 

Net
Cash Used in Investing Activities 

Net cash used in continuing investing activities for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 decreased by 3.8 million. This was a result of decreased spending for new property, plant,
and equipment, development endeavors, and current construction projects in 2024. 

Net
cash provided by discontinued investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 increased by 69.2 million.
This was a result of the cash received for the sale of the Polish parks of 59.4 million and from the sale of the Netherlands park of
 7.1 million. 

Net
Cash Provided by Financing Activities 

Net
cash provided by continuing financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 decreased by 5.9 million
mainly driven by a decrease in proceeds received from new construction loans as the Company acquired funding for new projects in 2023. 

Net
cash used in discontinued financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 increased by 93.9 million
mainly driven by the 75.2 million payment made towards the Solis Bonds principal balance and 7.3 million less repayment to shareholder
loans within the Company. Additionally, the Solis Bond waiver fee of 11.2 million was assessed and added to the Bond principal balance
in 2023. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

In
the notes to our consolidated financial statements and in Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have disclosed those accounting policies
that we consider to be most significant in determining our results of operations and financial condition and involve a higher degree
of judgment and complexity. There have been no changes to those policies that we consider to be material since the filing of our 2023
Annual Report on Form 10-K. The accounting principles used in preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements conform in all
material respects to GAAP.

For
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, see Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our exposures to market risk have not changed materially
since December 31, 2023. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or
submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and
reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our management, with the participation and supervision
of our Chief Executive Officer who is also the acting Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly
report. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer has concluded that as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures
were not, in design and operation, effective at a reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial
reporting described below. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not
be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

The
Company has identified the following material weakness in internal control over the financial reporting process. 

The
Company did not design and maintain an effective control environment commensurate with its financial reporting requirements. Specifically,
the Company lacked a sufficient number of professionals with an appropriate level of accounting knowledge, training and experience to
appropriately analyze, record and disclose accounting matters timely and accurately. Additionally, the lack of a sufficient number of
professionals resulted in an inability to consistently establish appropriate authorities and responsibilities in pursuit of its financial
reporting objectives, as demonstrated by, among other things, insufficient segregation of duties in its finance and accounting functions. 

To
the extent reasonably possible given our limited resources, we intend to take measures to cure the aforementioned weaknesses, including,
but not limited to, increasing the capacity of our qualified financial personnel to ensure that accounting policies and procedures are
consistent across the organization and that we have adequate controls over our Exchange Act reporting disclosures. 

The
 Company did not design and maintain effective controls for communicating and sharing information within the Company. Specifically,
 the accounting and finance departments were not consistently provided the complete and adequate support, documentation, and information
 including the nature of relationships with certain counterparties to record transactions within the financial statements timely,
 completely and accurately. 

The
accounting group has implemented a monthly review with the appropriate responsible parties within the Company, to review and confirm
that the accounting department has received the proper documentation for various transactions. 

The
 Company did not design and maintain effective controls for transactions between related parties and affiliates recorded between itself,
 the parent company and its subsidiaries. Specifically, the accounting and finance departments lacked formalized documentation establishing
 intercompany due to/from balances and did not periodically assess the collectability of such outstanding balances. 

As
part of the new deSPAC structure, the Company is in the process of formalizing documentation related to intercompany due to/from within
the new organization structure, and with Alternus Energy, Inc, which is the majority shareholder. 

58 

The
 Company did not design and maintain effective controls to address the identification of and accounting for certain non-routine, unusual
 or complex transactions, including the proper application of U.S. GAAP to such transactions. Specifically, the Company did not design
 and maintain controls to timely identify and account for warrant instruments related to certain promissory notes, forward purchase
 agreements, debt modifications, and impairment of discontinued operations. 

The
Company will have third party experts review non routine, unusual and complex transactions in order to have the required expertise to
confirm the proper accounting treatment. 

The
 Company did not design and maintain formal accounting policies, procedures and controls to achieve complete, accurate and timely
 financial accounting, reporting and disclosures, including controls over the period-end financial reporting process addressing areas
 including financial statement and footnote presentation and disclosures, account reconciliations and journal entries, including segregation
 of duties, assessing the reliability of reports and spreadsheets used in controls, and the timely identification and accounting for
 cut-off of expenditures. 

The
Company is working with an external consultant to review and assess the Company s current internal control structure to improve
the overall effectiveness of the control environment. In addition, the Company is investing in third party software to improve the accuracy,
review, and approval of account reconciliations and other accounting functions. Also, the Company is investing in third party software
to improve the process around the completion of the financial statements. 

The
material weaknesses described above could result in a material misstatement to substantially all of the Company s accounts or disclosures.
These material weaknesses lead management to conclude that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to
give reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in reports that the Company files under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported as and when required. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management
utilized the criteria established in the Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO) to conduct an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2023. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have identified the material weaknesses
described above in our internal controls over financial reporting and have therefore concluded that our internal controls over financial
reporting are not effective at the reasonable assurance level. 

As
stated above, a material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such
that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim consolidated financial statements
will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal control procedures over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) during our nine months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.
