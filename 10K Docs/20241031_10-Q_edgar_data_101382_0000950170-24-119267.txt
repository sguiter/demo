million in credit card receivables. Credit risk is a potential loss resulting from nonpayment of either the primary or secondary exposure. Credit risk is mitigated with formal risk management practices and a thorough initial credit-granting process including consistent underwriting standards and approval process. Control factors or techniques to minimize credit risk include knowing the client, understanding total exposure, analyzing the client and debtor s financial capacity, and monitoring the client s activities. Credit risk and portions of the portfolio risk are managed through concentration considerations, average risk ratings, and other aggregate characteristics. Loan Aging Analysis

Specialty lending A discussion of the credit quality indicators that impact each type of collateral securing Specialty loans is included below: Asset-based lending General asset-based loans are secured by accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, and real estate. The purpose of these loans is for financing current operations for commercial customers. The repayment of debt is reliant upon collection of the accounts receivable within 30 to 90 days or converting assets into

Commercial real estate A discussion of the credit quality indicators that impact each type of collateral securing Commercial real estate loans is included below: Owner-occupied Owner-occupied loans are secured by commercial real estate. These loans are often longer tenured and susceptible to multiple economic cycles. The loans rely on the owner-occupied operations to service debt which cover a broad spectrum of industries. Real estate debt can carry a significant amount of leverage for a borrower to maintain. Non-owner-occupied Non-owner-occupied loans are secured by commercial real estate. These loans are often longer tenured and susceptible to multiple economic cycles. The key element of risk in this type of lending is the cyclical nature of real estate markets. Although national conditions affect the overall real estate industry, the effect of national conditions on local markets is equally important. Factors such as unemployment rates, consumer demand, household formation, and the level of economic activity can vary widely from state to state and among metropolitan areas. In addition to geographic considerations, markets can be defined by property type. While all sectors are influenced by economic conditions, some sectors are more sensitive to certain economic factors than others. Farmland Farmland loans are secured by real estate used for agricultural purposes such as crop and livestock production. Assets used as collateral are long-term assets that carry the ability to have longer amortizations and maturities. Longer terms carry the risk of added susceptibility to market conditions. The limited purpose of some Agriculture-related collateral affects credit risk because such collateral may have limited or no other uses to support values when loan repayment problems emerge. 5+ Multi-family 5+ multi-family loans are secured by a multi-family residential property. The primary risks associated with this type of collateral are largely driven by economic conditions. The national and local market conditions can change with unemployment rates or competing supply of multi-family housing. Tenants may not be able to afford their housing or have better options and this can result in increased vacancy. Rents may need to be lowered to fill apartment units. Increased vacancy and lower rental rates not only drive the borrower s ability to repay debt but also contribute to how the collateral is valued. 1-4 Family construction 1-4 family construction loans are secured by 1-4 family residential real estate and are in the process of construction or improvements being made. The predominant risk inherent to this portfolio is the risk associated with a borrower s ability to successfully complete a project on time and within budget. Market conditions also play an important role in understanding the risk profile. Risk from adverse changes in market conditions from the start of development to completion can result in deflated collateral values. General construction General construction loans are secured by commercial real estate in process of construction or improvements being made and their repayment is dependent on the collateral s completion. Construction lending presents unique risks not encountered in term financing of existing real estate. The predominant risk inherent to this portfolio is the risk associated with a borrower s ability to successfully complete a

Consumer real estate A discussion of the credit quality indicators that impact each type of collateral securing Consumer real estate loans is included below: HELOC HELOC loans are revolving lines of credit secured by 1-4 family residential property. The primary risk is the borrower s inability to repay debt. Revolving notes are often associated with HELOCs that can be secured by real estate without a 1st lien priority. Collateral is susceptible to market volatility impacting home values or economic downturns.

Consumer A discussion of the credit quality indicators that impact each type of collateral securing Consumer loans is included below: Revolving line Consumer Revolving lines of credit are secured by consumer assets other than real estate. The primary risk associated with this collateral is related to market volatility and the value of the underlying financial assets. Auto Direct consumer auto loans are secured by new and used consumer vehicles. The primary risk with this collateral class is the rate at which the collateral depreciates. Other This category includes Other consumer loans made to an individual. The primary risk for this category is for those loans where the loan is unsecured. This collateral type also includes other unsecured lending such as consumer overdrafts.

Leases and other A discussion of the credit quality indicators that impact each type of collateral securing Leases and other loans is included below: Leases Leases are either loans to individuals for household, family and other personal expenditures or are loans related to all other direct financing and leveraged leases on property for leasing to lessees other than for household, family and other personal expenditure purposes. All leases are secured by the lease between the lessor and the lessee. These assignments grant the creditor a security interest in the rent stream from any lease, an important source of cash to pay the note in case of the borrower s default. Other Other loans are loans that are obligations of states and political subdivisions in the U.S., loans to non-depository financial institutions, loans for purchasing or carrying securities, or all other non-consumer loans. Risk associated with other loans is tied to the underlying collateral by each type of loan. Collateral is generally equipment, accounts receivable, inventory, 1-4 family residential construction and susceptible to the same risks mentioned with those collateral types previously. Other risks consist of collateral that is secured by the stock of a non-depository financial institution, which can be unlisted stock with a limited market for the stock, or volatility of asset values driven by market performance. Based on the factors noted above for each type of collateral, the Company assigns risk ratings to borrowers based on their most recently assessed financial position.

Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses (ACL) is a valuation account that is deducted from loans and held-to-maturity (HTM) securities amortized cost bases to present the net amount expected to be collected on the instrument. Loans and HTM securities are charged off against the ACL when management believes the balance has become uncollectible. Expected recoveries are included in the allowance and do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off. Management estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, related to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses and is tracked over an economic cycle to capture a through the cycle loss history. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in portfolio industry-based segmentation, 

 25 

and changes based on economic conditions. Due to current economic conditions, the Company s reasonable and supportable forecast period is . After the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts to historical losses. The reversion method applied to each portfolio can either be cliff or straight-line over four quarters. The ACL is measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exists. The ACL also incorporates qualitative factors which represent adjustments to historical credit loss experience for items such as concentrations of credit and results of internal loan review. The Company has identified the following portfolio segments and measures the allowance for credit losses using the following methods. The Company s portfolio segmentation consists of Commercial and industrial, Specialty lending, Commercial real estate, Consumer real estate, Consumer, Credit cards, Leases and other, and Held-to-maturity securities. Multiple modeling techniques are used to measure credit losses based on the portfolio. The ACL for Commercial and industrial and Leases and other segments are measured using a probability of default and loss given default method. Primary risk drivers within the segment are risk ratings of the individual loans along with changes of macro-economic variables. The economic variables utilized are typically comprised of leading and lagging indicators. The ACL for Commercial and industrial loans is calculated by modeling probability of default (PD) over future periods multiplied by historical loss given default rates (LGD) multiplied by contractual exposure at default minus any estimated prepayments and charge offs. Collateral positions for Specialty lending loans are continuously monitored by the Company and the borrower is required to continually adjust the amount of collateral securing the loan. Credit losses are measured for any position where the amortized cost basis is greater than the fair value of the collateral. The ACL for specialty lending loans is calculated by using a bottom-up approach comparing collateral values to outstanding balances. The ACL for the Commercial real estate segment is measured using a PD and LGD method. Primary risk characteristics within the segment are risk ratings of the individual loans, along with changes of macro-economic variables, such as interest rates, CRE price index, median household income, construction activity, farm income, and vacancy rates. The ACL for Commercial real estate loans is calculated by modeling PD over future periods based on peer bank data. The PD loss rate is then multiplied by historical LGD multiplied by contractual exposure at default minus any estimated prepayments and charge offs. The ACL for the Consumer real estate and Consumer segments are measured using an origination vintage loss rate method applied to the loans amortized cost balance. The primary risk driver within the segments is year of origination along with changes of macro-economic variables such as unemployment and the home price index. The Credit card segment contains both consumer and commercial credit cards. The ACL for Consumer credit cards is measured using a PD and LGD method for Revolvers and average historical loss rates across a defined lookback period for Transactors. The PD and LGD method used for Revolvers is similar in nature to the method used in the Commercial and industrial and Commercial real estate segments. Primary risk drivers within the segment are credit ratings of the individual card holders along with changes of macro-economic variables such as unemployment and retail sales. The ACL for Commercial credit cards is measured using roll-rate loss rate method based on days past due. The ACL for the State and political HTM securities segment is measured using a loss rate method based on historical bond rating transitions. Primary risk drivers within the segment are bond ratings in the portfolio along with changes of macro-economic conditions. There is no ACL for the U.S. Agency and GSE mortgage-backed HTM securities portfolios as they are considered to be agency-backed securities with no risk of loss as they are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government. For further discussion on these securities, including the aging and amortized cost balance of HTM securities, see Note 5, Securities. See the credit quality indicators presented previously for a summary of current risk in the Company s portfolio. Changes in economic forecasts will affect all portfolio segments, updated financial records from borrowers will affect portfolio segments by risk rating, updated credit scores will affect consumer credit cards,

Modifications made to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty In the normal course of business, the Company may execute loan modifications with borrowers. These modifications are analyzed to determine whether the modification is considered concessionary, long term and made to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. The Company s modifications generally include interest rate adjustments, principal reductions, and amortization and maturity date extensions. These modifications allow the borrower short-term cash relief to allow them to improve their financial condition. If a loan modification is determined to be made to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, the loan is considered collateral dependent and evaluated as part of the ACL as described above in the Allowance for Credit Losses section of this note. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had new modifications. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company had modifications on residential real estate loans made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty with a total pre-modification loan balance of thousand and a total 

 30 

thousand. For the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2023, the Company had new modifications. The Company had commitments to lend to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty for which the Company has modified an existing loan as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company monitors loan payments on an on-going basis to determine if a loan is considered to have a payment default. Determination of payment default involves analyzing the economic conditions that exist for each customer and their ability to generate positive cash flows during the loan term. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had loan modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty for which there was a payment default within the 12 months following the modification date.

The unrealized losses in the Company s investments were caused by changes in interest rates, and not from a decline in credit of the underlying issuers. The U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency, and GSE mortgage-backed securities are all considered to be agency-backed securities with no risk of loss as they are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government. The changes in fair value in the agency-backed portfolios are solely driven by change in interest rates caused by changing economic conditions. The Company has no knowledge of any underlying credit issues and the cash flows underlying the debt securities have not changed and are not expected to be impacted by changes in interest rates.

The unrealized losses in the Company s held-to-maturity portfolio were caused by changes in the interest rate environment. The U.S. Agency and GSE mortgage-backed securities are considered to be agency-backed securities with no risk of loss as they are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government. Therefore, the Company s expected lifetime loss for these portfolios is zero and there is no ACL recorded for these portfolios. The Company has no knowledge of any underlying credit issues and the cash flows underlying the debt securities have not changed and are not expected to be impacted by changes in interest rates. For the State and political subdivision portfolio, the Company s holdings are in general obligation bonds as well as private placement bonds, which have very low historical default rates due to issuers generally having unlimited taxing authority to service the debt. The Company has a robust process for monitoring credit risk, including both pre-purchase and ongoing post-purchase credit reviews and analysis. The Company monitors credit ratings of all bond issuers in these segments and reviews available financial data, including market and sector trends. The underlying bonds are evaluated for credit losses in conjunction with management s estimate of the ACL based on credit rating.

Other income The Company recognizes other miscellaneous income through a variety of other revenue streams, the most material of which include letter of credit fees, certain loan origination fees, gains on the sale of assets, derivative income, and bank-owned and company-owned life insurance income. These revenue streams are outside of the scope of ASC 606 and are recognized in accordance with the applicable U.S. GAAP. The remainder of Other income is primarily earned through transactions with personal banking customers, including wire transfer service charges, stop payment charges, and fees for items like money orders and cashier s checks. The performance obligations of these types of fees are satisfied as transactions are completed and revenue is recognized upon transaction execution according to established fee schedules with the customers. The Company had no material contract assets, contract liabilities, or remaining performance obligations as of September 30, 2024 . Total receivables from revenue recognized under the scope of ASC 606 were mill ion and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These receivables are included as part of the Other assets line on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Allowance for Credit Losses on Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancelable by the Company. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life. The estimate is based on expected utilization rates by portfolio segment. Utilization rates are influenced by historical trends and current conditions.

Fair Value Hedges of Interest Rate Risk The Company is exposed to changes in the fair value of certain of its fixed-rate assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates. Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges involve making fixed rate payments to a counterparty in exchange for the Company receiving variable rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any interest rate swaps that were designated as fair value hedges of interest rate risk. During 2022 and 2023, the Company terminated 10 fair value hedges of interest rate risk associated with the Company's municipal bond securities. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 the Company reclassified million and million, respectively, from AOCI to Interest income in connection with these terminated hedges. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 the Company reclassified million and million, respectively, from AOCI to Interest income in connection with these terminated hedges. The unrealized gain on the terminated fair value hedges remaining in AOCI was million net of tax, and million net of tax, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The hedging adjustments will be amortized through the contractual maturity date of each respective hedged item. For derivatives designated and that qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in Interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk The Company s objective in using interest rate derivatives is to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps, floors, and floor spreads as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company had interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk associated with the Company s variable-rate subordinated debentures issued by Marquette Capital Trusts III and IV. These swaps had an aggregate notional amount of million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Interest rate floors designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty if interest rates fall below the strike rate on the contract in exchange for an upfront premium. Interest

interest rate floors and floor spreads with an aggregate notional amount of billion that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2023 , the Company had interest rate floors and floor spreads with an aggregate notional amount of billion that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk. In 2020, the Company terminated an interest rate floor designated as a cash flow hedge. As of December 31, 2023 , the gross unrealized gain on the terminated interest rate floor remaining in AOCI was million net of tax. As of September 30, 2024 there was gross unrealized gain on the terminated interest rate floor remaining in AOCI. The unrealized gain was reclassified into Interest income as the underlying forecasted transactions impact earnings through the original maturity of the hedged forecasted transactions. For derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in AOCI and is subsequently reclassified into interest expense and interest income in the period during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. Amounts reported in AOCI related to interest rate swap derivatives will be reclassified to Interest expense as interest payments are received or paid on the Company s hedged items. Amounts reported in AOCI related to interest rate floor and floor spread derivatives will be reclassified to Interest income as interest payments are received or paid on the Company s items. The Company expects to reclassify million from AOCI as a reduction to Interest expense and million from AOCI to Interest income during the next 12 months. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions over a maximum period of years. Non-designated Hedges The remainder of the Company s derivatives are not designated in qualifying hedging relationships. Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and result from a service the Company provides to certain customers. The Company executes interest rate swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. Those interest rate swaps are simultaneously offset by interest rate swaps that the Company executes with a third party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions. As the interest rate swaps associated with this program do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements, changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are recognized directly in earnings. The changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are recognized in Other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company had interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of billion related to this program. As of December 31, 2023 , the Company had interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of billion.

Credit-risk-related Contingent Features The Company has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision that if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. The Company has minimum collateral posting thresholds with certain of its derivative counterparties. At September 30, 2024, the Compa ny had t poste d any collateral as there were derivatives in a net liability position. If the Company had breached any of these provisions at September 30, 2024 , it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at the termination value.

Valuation methods for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments measured on a recurring basis: Trading Securities Fair values for trading securities (including financial futures), are based on quoted market prices where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices for similar securities. Available-for-Sale Securities Fair values are based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes, if available. If a quoted market price is not available, fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities. Prices are provided by third-party pricing services and are based on observable market inputs. On an annual basis, the Company compares a sample of these prices to other independent sources for the same securities. Additionally, throughout the year, if securities are sold, comparisons are made between the pricing services prices and the market prices at which the securities were sold. Variances are analyzed, and, if appropriate, additional research is conducted with the third-party pricing services. Based on this research, the pricing services may affirm or revise their quoted price. No significant adjustments have been made to the prices provided by the pricing services. The pricing services also provide documentation on an ongoing basis that includes reference data, inputs and methodology by asset class, which is reviewed to ensure that security placement within the fair value hierarchy is appropriate. Equity securities with readily determinable fair values Fair values are based on quoted market prices. Company-owned Life Insurance Fair value is equal to the cash surrender value of the life insurance policies.

Valuation methods for instruments measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments measured on a non-recurring basis: Collateral Dependent Assets Collateral dependent assets are assets evaluated as part of the ACL on an individual basis. Those assets for which there is an associated allowance are considered financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Adjustments are recorded on certain assets to reflect write-downs that are based on the external appraised value of the underlying collateral. The external appraisals are generally based on recent sales of comparable properties which are then adjusted for the unique characteristics of the property being valued. In the case of non-real estate collateral, reliance is placed on a variety of sources, including external estimates of value and judgments based on the experience and expertise of internal specialists within the Company s property management group and the Company s credit department. The valuations of the collateral dependent assets are

Cash and short-term investments The carrying amounts of cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and resell agreements are reasonable estimates of their fair values. Securities held to maturity For U.S. Agency and mortgage-backed securities, as well as general obligation bonds in the State and political subdivision portfolio, fair values are based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes, if available. If a quoted market price is not available, fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities. Prices are provided by third-party pricing services and are based on observable market inputs. On an annual basis, the Company compares a sample of these prices to other independent sources for the same securities. Variances are analyzed, and, if appropriate, additional research is conducted with the third-party pricing services. Based on this research, the pricing services may affirm or revise their quoted price. No significant adjustments have been made to the prices provided by the pricing services. The pricing services also provide documentation on an ongoing basis that includes reference data, inputs and methodology by asset class, which is reviewed to ensure that security placement within the fair value hierarchy is appropriate. For private placement bonds in the State and political subdivision portfolio, fair values are estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current market rates. Other securities Amount consists of FRB and FHLB stock held by the Company, equity securities with readily determinable fair values, and equity securities without readily determinable fair values, including equity-method investments and other miscellaneous investments. The carrying amount of the FRB and FHLB stock equals its fair value because the shares can only be redeemed by the FRB and FHLB at their carrying amount. Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value using quoted market prices. Equity securities without readily determinable fair values are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Loans Fair values are estimated for portfolios with similar financial characteristics. Loans are segregated by type, such as commercial, real estate, consumer, and credit card. Each loan category is further segmented into fixed and variable interest rate categories. The fair value of loans are estimated by discounting the future cash flows. The

Any forward-looking statement made by the Company or on its behalf speaks only as of the date that it was made. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the impact of events, circumstances, or results that arise after the date that the statement was made, except as required by applicable securities laws.

 Overview 
 The Company focuses on the following four core financial objectives. Management believes these objectives will guide its efforts to achieve its vision, to deliver the Unparalleled Customer Experience, all while seeking to improve net income and strengthen the balance sheet while undertaking prudent risk management. 
 
 The first financial objective is to continuously improve operating efficiencies. The Company has focused on identifying efficiencies that simplify our organizational and reporting structures, streamline back-office functions, and take advantage of synergies and newer technologies among various platforms and distribution networks. The Company has identified and expects to continue identifying ongoing efficiencies through the normal course of business that, when combined with increased revenue, will contribute to improved operating leverage. During the third quarter of 2024, total revenue increased 50.5 million, or 14.2 , as compared to the third quarter of 2023, while noninterest expense increased 21.0 million, or 9.1 , for the same period. As part of the initiative to improve operating efficiencies, the Company continues to invest in technological advances that it believes will help management drive operating leverage in the future through improved data analysis and automation. The Company also continues to evaluate core systems and will invest in enhancements that it believes will yield operating efficiencies. 
 
 The second financial objective is to increase net interest income through profitable loan and deposit growth and the optimization of the balance sheet. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company had an increase in net interest income of 25.1 million, or 11.3 , from the same period in 2023. The change in net interest income was driven by increased average loan growth and higher rates, partially offset by higher interest expense due to an unfavorable mix shift in the composition of liabilities. These changes are driven by the higher interest rate environment compared to the third quarter of 2023. The increase in interest income was driven by a 1.6 billion, or 7.2 , increase in average loans, driven by organic loan growth, coupled with the impact of higher short-term and long-term interest rates. The funding for these assets was driven primarily by a 4.5 billion, or 21.0 , increase in average interest-bearing deposits, offset by a decrease in average borrowed funds of 1.1 billion, or 43.8 , compared to the same period in 2023. Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, increased three basis points compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to increased loan yields and earning asset mix, partially offset by the cost and mix of interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest spread increased by three basis points during the same period. The Company expects to see continued volatility in the economic markets resulting from governmental responses to inflation and reversionary signs in the economy. These changing conditions could have impacts on the balance sheet and income statement of the Company for the remainder of the year. 
 
 The third financial objective is to grow the Company s revenue from noninterest sources. The Company seeks to grow noninterest revenues throughout all economic and interest rate cycles, while positioning itself to benefit in periods of economic growth. Noninterest income increased 25.4 million, or 19.1 , to 158.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. See greater detail below under Noninterest Income. The Company continues to emphasize its asset management, brokerage, bankcard services, healthcare services, and treasury management businesses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest income represented 39.1 of total revenue, compared to 37.5 for the same period in 2023. The recent economic changes have impacted fee income, especially those with assets tied to market values and interest rates. 
 
 The fourth financial objective is effective capital management. The Company places a significant emphasis on maintaining a strong capital position, which management believes promotes investor confidence, provides access to funding sources under favorable terms, and enhances the Company s ability to capitalize on business growth and acquisition opportunities. The Company continues to maximize shareholder value through a mix of reinvesting in organic growth, evaluating acquisition opportunities that complement the Company s strategies, increasing 
 58 

dividends over time, and appropriately utilizing a share repurchase program. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 3.5 billion in total shareholders equity. This is an increase of 728.8 million, or 26.0 , compared to total shareholders equity at September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the Company had a total risk-based capital ratio of 13.14 . The Company did not repurchase shares of common stock during the third quarter of 2024, except for shares acquired pursuant to the Company's share-based incentive programs. 
 On April 28, 2024, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) with HTLF, a Delaware corporation, and Blue Sky Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Merger Agreement and the merger were unanimously approved by the boards of directors of the Company and HTLF. Pending regulatory approval and approval by the shareholders of the Company and HTLF, the merger is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, HTLF stockholders will receive a fixed exchange ratio of 0.55 shares of the Company s common stock for each share of HTLF stock, with a total market value of approximately 2.0 billion. 
 Additionally, on April 29, 2024, the Company also announced that in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, it entered into a forward sale agreement with BofA Securities, Inc. or its affiliate to issue 2,800,000 shares of its common stock for approximate proceeds of 201.6 million. The underwriters were granted an option to purchase up to an additional 420,000 shares of the Company's common stock exercisable within 30 days of April 28, 2024. The underwriters exercised this option in full on April 30, 2024, upon which the Company entered into an additional forward sale agreement relating to the 420,000 shares of the Company's common stock. The forward purchase agreement is classified as an equity instrument under ASC 815-40, Contracts in Entity s Own Equity . 
 The rapid rise in interest rates during 2022 and 2023, the resulting industry-wide reduction in the fair value of securities portfolios, and the bank runs that led to the failures of some financial institutions in March of 2023, among other events, have resulted in significant volatility in the U.S. banking sector and heightened focus on liquidity, uninsured deposits, deposit composition, unrecognized investment losses, and capital. 
 
 During November 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC) approved a final rule to implement a special assessment to recover the losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund (the DIF) associated with protecting uninsured depositors following the closures of certain financial institutions in March of 2023. The assessment base for the special assessment is equal to an insured depository institution s uninsured deposits as of December 31, 2022, adjusted to exclude the first 5 billion, and will be collected at an annual rate of 13.4 basis points for eight quarterly assessment periods. The Company s portion of this special assessment was 52.8 million and was recognized in noninterest expense during the fourth quarter of 2023. During 2024, the FDIC increased the estimated loss attributable to the 2023 bank failures, which in turn increased the special assessment the FDIC will charge to insured depository institutions. The FDIC also announced that the special assessment will be collected for an additional two quarters beyond the initial eight-quarter collection period, at an estimated quarterly rate of 1.9 basis points. The projected number of additional quarters and the estimated rate applicable to those quarters is subject to change based on future adjustments to estimated losses or amendments to the assessment base. The Company recorded 7.5 million of expense related to the updated special assessment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and its impacts are discussed below. 
 Earnings Summary 
 The following is a summary regarding the Company s earnings for the third quarter of 2024. The changes identified in the summary are explained in greater detail below. The Company recorded net income of 109.6 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of 96.6 million for the same period a year earlier. Basic earnings per share for the third quarter of 2024 were 2.25 per share 2.23 per share fully-diluted) compared to 1.99 per share 1.98 per share fully-diluted) for the third quarter of 2023. Return on average assets and return on average common shareholders equity for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 were 1.01 and 12.63 , respectively, compared to 0.97 and 13.25 , respectively, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. 
 The Company recorded net income of 321.2 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of 279.1 million for the same period a year earlier. Basic earnings per share for the 
 59 

nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 were 6.59 per share 6.56 per share fully-diluted) compared to 5.76 per share 5.73 per share fully-diluted) for the same period in 2023. Return on average assets and return on average common shareholders equity for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 were 1.01 and 13.13 , respectively, compared to 0.95 and 13.18 , respectively, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net interest income for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 increased 25.1 million, or 11.3 , and increased 42.3 million, or 6.1 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, average earning assets increased by 3.7 billion, or 9.8 , and for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, they increased by 3.0 billion, or 8.1 , compared to the same periods in 2023. Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, increased to 2.46 and decreased to 2.49 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 2.43 and 2.54 for the same periods in 2023. 
 The provision for credit losses increased by 13.0 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 and increased by 0.8 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023. These changes were driven by loan growth, portfolio credit metric changes, and changes in macro-economic metrics in the current period as compared to the prior periods. The Company s nonperforming loans increased 2.2 million to 19.3 million at September 30, 2024, compared to September 30, 2023. The ACL on loans as a percentage of total loans increased three basis points to 1.00 as of September 30, 2024, compared to September 30, 2023. For a description of the Company s methodology for computing the ACL, please see the summary discussion in the Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses section included below. 
 Noninterest income increased by 25.4 million, or 19.1 , for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, and increased by 61.3 million, or 15.3 , for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. These changes are discussed in greater detail below under Noninterest Income. 
 Noninterest expense increased by 21.0 million, or 9.1 , for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, and increased by 47.2 million, or 6.6 , for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. These changes are discussed in greater detail below under Noninterest Expense. 
 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income is a significant source of the Company s earnings and represents the amount by which interest income on earning assets exceeds the interest expense paid on liabilities. The volume of interest-earning assets and the related funding sources, the overall mix of these assets and liabilities, and the rates paid on each affect net interest income. Net interest income for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 increased 25.1 million, or 11.3 , and increased 42.3 million, or 6.1 , compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 Table 1 shows the impact of earning asset rate changes compared to changes in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. As illustrated in this table, net interest spread for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased three basis points as compared to the same period in 2023. Net interest margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased three basis points compared to the same period in 2023. Net interest spread for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 12 basis points as compared to the same period in 2023. Net interest margin for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 decreased by five basis points compared to the same period in 2023. The changes for three-month period ended September 30, 2024 are primarily due to increased average loan balances and rates, partially offset by higher interest costs due to unfavorable mix shift in the composition of liabilities. The changes for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 were related to the cost and mix of interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by increased loan volumes, repricing of earning assets, and the benefit of interest free funds. The impact of the increased cost and mix of interest-bearing liabilities had a significant impact in the third quarter of 2024. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 36 basis points from the third quarter of 2023 while the yield on earning assets increased 39 basis points compared to the same period. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 66 basis points for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 while the yield on earning assets increased 54 basis points compared to the same period. Earning asset balance increases have been primarily driven by higher average loans and increased interest-bearing due from banks balances. The Company expects to see continued volatility in the economic markets and governmental responses to changes in the economy. These changing conditions could have impacts on the 
 60 

balance sheet and income statement of the Company for the remainder of the year. For the impact of the contribution from free funds, see the Analysis of Net Interest Margin within Table 2 below. Table 2 also illustrates how the changes in volume and interest rates have resulted in an increase in net interest income. 
 Table 1 
 AVERAGE BALANCE SHEETS/YIELDS AND RATES (tax-equivalent basis) (unaudited, dollars in thousands) 
 The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the average earning assets and resulting yields, as well as the average interest-bearing liabilities and resulting yields, expressed in both dollars and rates. All average balances are daily average balances. The average yield on earning assets without the tax-equivalent basis adjustment would have been 5.41 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, and 5.01 for the same period in 2023. The average yield on earning assets without the tax-equivalent basis adjustment would have been 5.35 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, and 4.80 for the same period in 2023.

Table 2 presents the dollar amount of change in net interest income and margin due to volume and rate. Table 2 also reflects the effect that interest-free funds have on net interest margin. The average balance of interest-free funds (total earning assets less interest-bearing liabilities) increased 48.9 million and decreased 413.5 million for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The benefit from interest-free funds was flat and increased seven basis points in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to increased short-term interest rates.

Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The ACL represents management s judgment of the total expected losses included in the Company s loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The Company s process for recording the ACL is based on the evaluation of the Company s lifetime historical loss experience, management s understanding of the credit quality inherent in the loan portfolio, and the impact of the current economic environment, coupled with reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. 
 A mathematical calculation of an estimate is made to assist in determining the adequacy and reasonableness of management s recorded ACL. To develop the estimate, the Company follows the guidelines in ASC 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses . The estimate reserves for assets held at amortized cost and any related credit 
 63 

deterioration in the Company s available-for-sale debt security portfolio. Assets held at amortized cost include the Company s loan book and held-to-maturity security portfolio. 
 The process involves the consideration of quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the specific segmentation of loans. These factors have been established over decades of financial institution experience and include economic observation and loan loss characteristics. This process is designed to produce a lifetime estimate of the losses, at a reporting date, that includes evaluation of historical loss experience, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and the qualitative framework outlined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in the published 2020 Interagency Policy Statement. This process allows management to take a holistic view of the recorded ACL reserve and ensure that all significant and pertinent information is considered. 
 The Company considers a variety of factors to ensure the safety and soundness of its estimate including a strong internal control framework, extensive methodology documentation, credit underwriting standards which encompass the Company s desired risk profile, model validation, and ratio analysis. If the Company s total ACL estimate, as determined in accordance with the approved ACL methodology, is either outside a reasonable range based on review of economic indicators or by comparison of historical ratio analysis, the ACL estimate is an outlier and management will investigate the underlying reason(s). Based on that investigation, issues or factors that previously had not been considered may be identified in the estimation process, which may warrant adjustments to estimated credit losses. 
 The ending result of this process is a recorded consolidated ACL that represents management s best estimate of the total expected losses included in the loan portfolio, held-to-maturity securities, and credit deterioration in available-for-sale securities. 
 Based on the factors above, management of the Company recorded 18.0 million as provision for credit losses for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 5.0 million for the same period in 2023. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, management of the Company recorded 42.1 million as provision for credit losses, as compared to 41.2 million for the same period in 2023. These changes are the result of applying the methodology for computing the ACL, coupled with the impacts of the current and forecasted economic environment. As illustrated in Table 3 below, the ACL on loans increased three basis points to 1.00 of total loans as of September 30, 2024, compared to September 30, 2023. 
 Table 3 presents a summary of the Company s ACL for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and for the year ended December 31, 2023. Net charge-offs were 14.3 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 9.1 million for the same period in 2023. See Credit Risk Management under Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in this report for information relating to nonaccrual loans, past due loans, restructured loans and other credit risk matters.

Noninterest Income 
 A key objective of the Company is the growth of noninterest income to provide a diverse source of revenue not directly tied to interest rates. Fee-based services are typically non-credit related and are not generally affected by fluctuations in interest rates. 
 The Company offers multiple fee-based products and services, which management believes will more closely align with customer demands. The Company is currently emphasizing fee-based products and services including trust and securities processing, bankcard, securities trading and brokerage, and cash and treasury management. Management believes that it can offer these products and services both efficiently and profitably, as most have common platforms and support structures.

Noninterest income increased by 25.4 million, or 19.1 , during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, and increased 61.3 million, or 15.3 , during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. Table 4 above summarizes the components of noninterest income and the respective year-over-year comparison for each category. 
 Trust and securities processing income consists of fees earned on personal and corporate trust accounts, custody of securities services, trust investments and wealth management services, mutual fund assets, and alternative asset servicing. The increase in these fees for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, was primarily due to an increase in fund services and corporate trust revenues. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, fund services revenue increased 5.2 million, or 13.6 , corporate trust revenue increased 1.8 million, or 12.4 , and trust income increased 0.6 million, or 4.2 , compared to the same period in 2023. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, fund services revenue increased 15.8 million, or 14.7 , corporate trust revenue increased 4.3 million, or 10.2 , and trust services revenue increased 3.1 million, or 7.4 , compared to the same period in 2023. The recent volatile markets have impacted the income in this category. Since trust and securities processing fees are primarily asset-based, which are highly correlated to the change in market value of the assets, the related income for the remainder of the year will be affected by changes in the securities markets. Management continues to emphasize sales of services to both new and existing clients as well as increasing and improving the distribution channels. 
 Trading and investment banking fees for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 increased 3.3 million, or 88.8 , and increased 4.2 million, or 30.0 , for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. These changes were primarily driven by the volatile market s impact on trading volume. The income in this category is market driven and impacted by general increases or decreases in trading volume. 
 66 

Service charges on deposit accounts for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 decreased 1.0 million, or 4.7 , and decreased 0.5 million, or 0.8 , for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. The decrease for the three-month and nine-month period were driven by decreased healthcare income. 
 Brokerage fees for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.3 million, or 17.5 , and increased 2.2 million, or 5.5 , for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. The changes in the three-month and nine-month periods were driven by 12b-1 fees and money market income. 
 Bankcard fees for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 increased 3.1 million, or 16.1 , and increased 10.7 million, or 19.0 , respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase was driven by increased interchange income for the three-month period and increased interchange coupled with lower rebate costs in the nine-month period. 
 Investment securities gains, net for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.4 million, or 867.9 , and increased 14.3 million, or 343.8 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, was primarily driven by net gains on dispositions of, and increased valuations in the Company's securities without readily determinable fair values during the third quarter of 2024. The increase for the nine-month period was driven by a net gain of 12.0 million on dispositions of securities without readily determinable fair values during 2024, coupled with a 4.9 million impairment loss on one Corporate available-for-sale security during the same period in 2023. The income in this category is highly correlated to the change in market value of the assets, and the related income for the remainder of the year will be affected by changes in the securities markets. The Company s investment portfolio is continually evaluated for opportunities to improve its performance and risk profile relative to market conditions and the Company s interest rate expectations. This can result in differences from quarter to quarter in the amount of realized gains or losses on this portfolio. 
 Other noninterest income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, increased 7.7 million, or 90.0 , compared to the same period in 2023, driven by a 4.0 million increase in company-owned life insurance income, a 1.1 million gain on the sale of a building, a 0.9 million increase in syndication fees, and a 0.7 million increase in bank-owned life insurance income. For the nine-month period, other noninterest income increased 7.3 million, or 18.2 , compared to the same period in 2023, primarily driven by a 2.1 million increase in bank-owned life insurance income, a 1.5 million increase in company-owned life insurance income, a gain on sale of land of 1.8 million during the first quarter, a gain of 1.1 million on the sale of a building in the third quarter, and increases of 0.9 million in both syndication fees and foreign currency valuation. These increases are offset by a decrease in derivative income of 1.9 million.

 Equipment expense decreased 1.2 million, or 7.1 , and 4.0 million, or 7.8 , for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to decreased software expense. 
 Processing fees increased 3.7 million, or 14.1 , and 11.5 million, or 15.2 , for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to increased software subscription costs.

Income Tax Expense 
 The Company s effective tax rate was 19.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 18.1 for the same period in 2023. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2024 is primarily attributable to a smaller portion of income being earned from tax-exempt municipal securities and higher non-deductible acquisition costs in 2024. 
 Strategic Lines of Business 
 The Company has strategically aligned its operations into the following three reportable Business Segments: Commercial Banking, Institutional Banking, and Personal Banking. The Company s senior executive officers regularly evaluate Business Segment financial results produced by the Company s internal reporting system in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance for individual Business Segments. For comparability purposes, amounts in all periods are based on methodologies in effect at September 30, 2024. Previously reported results have been reclassified in this Form 10-Q to conform to the Company s current organizational structure.

For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, Commercial Banking net income increased 46.3 million, or 24.6 , to 234.5 million, as compared to the same period in 2023. Net interest income increased 41.4 million, or 9.3 , for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, driven by strong loan growth, earning asset mix changes, and the increase in short-term interest rates. Provision for credit losses decreased 0.3 million for the period, driven by portfolio metric changes and changes in macro-economic metrics in 2024 as compared to 2023. Noninterest income increased 29.3 million, or 40.8 , compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to increases of 13.1 million in investment security gains, 6.4 million in bankcard income, 4.9 million in other income driven by a legal settlement in the first quarter of 2024 and increased life insurance income, and 3.2 million in service charges on deposit accounts. Noninterest expense increased 11.7 million, or 4.7 , to 263.4 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was driven by an increase of 5.6 million in technology, service, and overhead expenses, an increase 2.0 million in salary and employee benefit expense, an increase of 2.0 million in bankcard expense, an increase of 1.2 million in processing fees, and a 0.9 million increase in marketing and business

development. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 0.8 million in other expense driven by lower operational losses in the current period.

For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, Institutional Banking net income decreased 2.6 million, or 2.3 , to 110.0 million, as compared to the same period last year. Net interest income decreased 1.9 million, or 1.3 , compared to the same period last year, driven by higher deposit interest expense due to the increase in short-term interest rates. Provision for credit losses increased 1.0 million for the period, driven by portfolio metric changes and changes in macro-economic metrics in 2024 as compared to 2023. Noninterest income increased 30.9 million, or 12.0 , primarily due to increases of 19.9 million in trust and securities processing income driven by higher fund services and corporate trust revenue, an increase of 4.9 million in bankcard income, an increase of 4.2 million in bond trading income, an increase of 2.3 million in brokerage income, and an increase of 1.4 million in other income. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 3.2 million in service charges on deposit accounts. Noninterest expense increased 30.0 million, or 11.2 , primarily driven by increases of 9.8 million in technology, service, and overhead expenses, 9.2 million in salaries and employee benefits expense, 7.4 million in bankcard expense, 4.7 million in processing fees, 1.1 million in legal and consulting expense, and 1.1 million in equipment expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 3.1 million in operational losses.

Loans represent the Company s largest source of interest income. In addition to growing the commercial loan portfolio, management believes its middle market commercial business and its consumer business, including home equity and credit card loan products, are the market niches that represent its best opportunity to cross-sell fee-related services and generate additional noninterest income for the Company. 
 Actual loan balances totaled 25.0 billion as of September 30, 2024, and increased 1.8 billion, or 7.8 , compared to December 31, 2023, and increased 2.1 billion, or 9.2 , compared to September 30, 2023. Compared to December 31, 2023, commercial real estate loans increased 887.1 million, or 10.0 , commercial and industrial loans increased 741.7 million, or 7.5 , and credit card loans increased 157.8 million, or 37.2 . Compared to September 30, 2023, commercial real estate loans increased 1.0 billion, or 11.4 , commercial and industrial loans increased 882.0 million, or 9.0 , consumer real estate loans increased 186.6 million, or 6.4 , and credit card loans increased 131.2 million, or 29.1 . The increase in credit card loans in both periods is related to the purchase of 109.4 million in co-branded credit card receivables during the first quarter of 2024. See further information in Note 4, Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, commercial real estate loans comprised approximately 39.1 and 38.4 , respectively, of the Company's loan portfolio. Commercial real estate loans generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than consumer real estate loans because they typically have larger balances and are more affected by adverse conditions in the economy. Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate often depend upon the successful operation and management of the properties and the businesses which operate from within them, repayment of such loans may be affected by factors outside the borrower s control, such as adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy or changes in government regulations. In recent years, commercial real estate markets have been particularly impacted by the economic disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has also been a catalyst for the evolution of various remote work options, which could impact the long-term performance of some types of office properties within our commercial real estate portfolio. Due to these risks, the Company is actively monitoring its exposure to commercial real estate. 
 Generally, these loans are made for investment and real estate development or working capital and business expansion purposes and are primarily secured by real estate with a maximum loan-to-value of 80 . Most of these properties are non-owner occupied and have guarantees as additional security. The Company's investment CRE portfolio (which includes non-owner occupied and construction loans) totaled 27.7 and 26.5 of total Company loans as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The average investment CRE loan was approximately 6.9 million and 5.8 million, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and 90 are recourse loans as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. These loans have an average loan-to-value of 57 as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 The properties securing the commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location. This diversity helps reduce exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single market or industry. Notwithstanding, commercial real estate loans, in general, may be more adversely impacted by conditions in the real estate market or the economy.

The shift to work-from-home and hybrid work environments has caused a decreased utilization of, and demand for, office space. The Company is actively monitoring its exposure to office space in its non-owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio. The average loan size in the Company's office portfolio was approximately 9.3 million and 9.2 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The average loan-to-value of the office portfolio was 64 as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and 84 are recourse loans as of the end of both periods. Further, only 23 and 30 of the Company's office portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, is in central business districts, which have been more heavily impacted by the shift to remote work. The remainder of the Company's office portfolio is in suburban or medical properties.

Nonaccrual, past due and restructured loans are discussed under Credit Risk Management within Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in this report. 
 Investment Securities 
 The Company s investment portfolio contains trading, AFS, and HTM securities, as well as FRB stock, FHLB stock, and other miscellaneous investments. Investment securities totaled 13.0 billion as of September 30, 2024, and 13.3 billion as of December 31, 2023, and comprised 28.9 and 31.9 of the Company s earning assets, respectively, as of those dates. 
 The Company s AFS securities portfolio comprised 54.0 of the Company s total securities portfolio at September 30, 2024 and 53.3 at December 31, 2023. The Company s AFS securities portfolio provides liquidity as a result of the composition and average life of the underlying securities. This liquidity can be used to fund loan growth or to offset the outflow of traditional funding sources. The average life of the AFS securities portfolio was 55.4 months at September 30, 2024, compared to 52.6 months at December 31, 2023, and 61.7 months at September 30, 2023. In addition to providing a potential source of liquidity, the AFS securities portfolio can be used as a tool to manage interest rate sensitivity. The Company s goal in the management of its AFS securities portfolio is to maximize return within the Company s parameters of liquidity goals, interest rate risk, and credit risk. 
 Management expects collateral pledging requirements for public funds, loan demand, and deposit funding to be the primary factors impacting changes in the level of AFS securities. There were 9.4 billion and 10.1 billion of securities pledged to secure U.S. Government deposits, other public deposits, certain trust deposits, derivative transactions, and repurchase agreements at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 The Company s HTM securities portfolio consists of U.S. agency-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, general obligation bonds, and private placement bonds. The HTM portfolio, net of the ACL, totaled 5.5 billion and 5.7 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The average life of the HTM portfolio was 8.7 years at September 30, 2024, compared to 8.4 years at December 31, 2023, and 9.5 years at September 30, 2023. 
 The securities portfolio generates the Company s second largest component of interest income. The securities portfolio achieved an average yield on a tax-equivalent basis of 2.93 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.64 for the same period in 2023. 
 At September 30, 2024, the unrealized pre-tax net loss on the AFS securities portfolio was 449.4 million, or 6.0 of the 7.5 billion amortized cost value, a decrease of 174.9 million as compared to December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the unrealized pre-tax net loss on the securities designated as HTM was 563.5 million, or 10.3 of amortized cost value, compared to 508.5 million at December 31, 2023. During 2022, the Company transferred securities with an amortized cost balance of 4.1 billion and a fair value of 3.8 billion from the AFS category to the HTM category. The transfer of securities was made at fair value at the time of transfer. The 
 74 

remaining balance of unrealized pre-tax losses related to transferred securities was 179.8 million as of September 30, 2024, and 207.2 million as of December 31, 2023, and was included in the amortized cost balance of HTM securities. See further information in Note 5, Securities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Deposits and Borrowed Funds 
 Deposits increased 3.9 billion, or 10.9 , from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 and increased 6.3 billion, or 18.8 , from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024. Total interest-bearing balances increased 3.2 billion and noninterest-bearing deposits increased 710.3 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. Total interest-bearing deposits increased 4.7 billion and noninterest-bearing deposits increased 1.6 billion from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024. Noninterest-bearing deposits were 32.3 , 33.9 , and 33.7 of total deposits at September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Deposits represent the Company s primary funding source for its asset base. In addition to the core deposits garnered by the Company s retail branch structure, the Company continues to focus on its cash management services, as well as its trust and investment company servicing businesses, in order to attract and retain additional deposits. Management believes a strong core deposit composition is one of the Company s key strengths given its competitive product mix. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were an estimated 28.6 billion of uninsured deposits, an increase of 4.2 billion as compared to December 31, 2023, and an increase of 7.9 billion as compared to September 30, 2023. Estimated uninsured deposits comprised approximately 72.2 , 68.2 , and 62.0 of total deposits as of September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023, respectively. A portion of these uninsured deposits represent affiliate deposits and collateralized deposits. Affiliate deposits represent deposit accounts owned by the wholly owned subsidiaries of UMB Financial Corporation that are on deposit at UMB Bank, n.a. Collateralized deposits are public fund deposits or corporate trust deposits that are collateralized by high quality securities within the investment portfolio. Excluding affiliate deposits of 2.6 billion and collateralized deposits of 5.4 billion, the adjusted estimated uninsured deposits were 20.7 billion as of September 30, 2024. The adjusted ratio of estimated uninsured deposits, excluding affiliate and collateralized deposits, as a percentage of total deposits was approximately 52.2 as of September 30, 2024. The adjusted ratio of estimated uninsured deposits, excluding affiliate and collateralized deposits, as a percentage of total deposits was approximately 45.3 as of December 31, 2023, and 42.6 as of September 30, 2023. 
 The Company participates in the IntraFi Cash Service program, which allows its customers to place deposits into the program to receive reciprocal FDIC insurance coverage. The Company had 1.2 billion, 1.2 billion, and 1.3 billion of deposits in the program as of September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Long-term debt totaled 384.8 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 383.2 million as of December 31, 2023, and 382.8 million as of September 30, 2023. 
 In September 2022, the Company issued 110.0 million in aggregate subordinated notes due in September 2032. The Company received 107.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, and used the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including, among other uses, contributing Tier 1 capital into the Bank. The subordinated notes were issued with a fixed-to-fixed rate of 6.25 and an effective rate of 6.64 , due to issuance costs, with an interest rate reset date of September 2027. 
 In September 2020, the Company issued 200.0 million in aggregate subordinated notes due in September 2030. The Company received 197.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, and used the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including, among other uses, contributing Tier 1 capital into the Bank. The subordinated notes were issued with a fixed-to-fixed rate of 3.70 and an effective rate of 3.93 , due to issuance costs, with an interest rate reset date of September 2025. 
 The remainder of the Company s long-term debt was assumed from the acquisition of Marquette Financial Companies (Marquette) and consists of debt obligations payable to four unconsolidated trusts (Marquette Capital 
 75 

Trust I, Marquette Capital Trust II, Marquette Capital Trust III, and Marquette Capital Trust IV) that previously issued trust preferred securities. These long-term debt obligations have an aggregate contractual balance of 103.1 million. Interest rates on trust preferred securities are tied to the three-month term SOFR with spreads ranging from 133 basis points to 160 basis points and reset quarterly. The trust preferred securities have maturity dates ranging from January 2036 to September 2036. 
 The Company has a revolving line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. which allows the Company to borrow up to 30.0 million for general working capital purposes. The interest rate applied to borrowed balances will be at the Company s option either 1.40 above SOFR or 1.75 below the prime rate on the date of an advance. The Company pays a 0.4 unused commitment fee for unused portions of the revolving line of credit. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company had no advances outstanding on this revolving line of credit. 
 Short-term debt totaled 1.1 billion as September 30, 2024 and consisted of a short-term borrowing with the FHLB of Des Moines for 250.0 million and an 800.0 million borrowing with the BTFP. The FHLB borrowing had an interest rate of 5.47 and matured in October 2024. The BTFP borrowing had a rate of 4.76 and was repaid in advance of its maturity in October 2024 . See further information in Note 7, Borrowed Funds in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled 2.0 billion as of September 30, 2024, 2.1 billion at December 31, 2023, and 1.8 billion at September 30, 2023. Repurchase agreements are transactions involving the exchange of investment funds by the customer for securities by the Company under an agreement to repurchase the same or similar issues at an agreed-upon price and date. 
 Capital and Liquidity 
 The Company places a significant emphasis on the maintenance of a strong capital position, which promotes investor confidence, provides access to funding sources under favorable terms, and enhances the Company s ability to capitalize on business growth and acquisition opportunities. Higher levels of liquidity, however, bear corresponding costs, measured in terms of lower yields on short-term, more liquid earning assets and higher expenses for extended liability maturities. The Company manages capital for each subsidiary based upon the subsidiary s respective risks and growth opportunities as well as regulatory requirements. 
 Total shareholders equity was 3.5 billion at September 30, 2024, a 435.1 million increase as compared to December 31, 2023, and a 728.8 million increase compared to September 30, 2023. 
 The Company s Board of Directors authorized, at its April 30, 2024 and April 26, 2022 meetings, the repurchase of up to one million shares and two million shares, respectively, of the Company s common stock during the twelve months following each meeting (each a Repurchase Authorization). On July 25, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to one million shares of the Company's common stock, which terminated on April 30, 2024. During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company did not repurchase shares of common stock pursuant to any of its announced Repurchase Authorizations, but did acquire shares pursuant to the Company's share-based incentive programs. 
 At the Company s quarterly board meeting, the Board of Directors declared a 0.40 per share quarterly cash dividend payable on January 2, 2025, to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 10, 2024. 
 On April 28, 2024, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement with HTLF, a Delaware corporation and Blue Sky Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Merger Agreement and the merger were unanimously approved by the boards of directors of the Company and HTLF. Pending regulatory approval and approval by the shareholders of the Company and HTLF, the merger is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, HTLF stockholders will receive a fixed exchange ratio of 0.55 shares of the Company s common stock for each share of HTLF stock, with a total market value of approximately 2.0 billion. 
 76 

Additionally, on April 29, 2024, the Company also announced that in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, it entered into a forward sale agreement with BofA Securities, Inc. or its affiliate to issue 2,800,000 shares of its common stock for approximate proceeds of 201.6 million. The underwriters were granted an option to purchase up to an additional 420,000 shares of the Company's common stock exercisable within 30 days of April 28, 2024. The underwriters exercised this option in full on April 30, 2024, upon which the Company entered into an additional forward sale agreement relating to the 420,000 shares of the Company's common stock. The forward purchase agreement is classified as an equity instrument under ASC 815-40, Contracts in Entity s Own Equity . 
 Through the Company s relationship with the FHLB of Des Moines, the Company owns 21.4 million of FHLB stock and has access to additional liquidity and funding sources through FHLB advances. The Company s borrowing capacity is dependent upon the amount of collateral the Company places at the FHLB. The Company had a short-term advance for 250.0 million outstanding at the FHLB of Des Moines as of September 30, 2024. This borrowing matured in October 2024. Additionally, during 2024, the FHLB of Des Moines issued a letter of credit for 150.0 million on behalf of the Company to secure deposits. This letter of credit expired in October 2024, was renewed, and will expire in January 2025. The Company s remaining borrowing capacity with the FHLB was 1.6 billion as of September 30, 2024. 
 The Company had an 800.0 million short-term borrowing outstanding with the Federal Reserve Bank's BTFP as of September 30, 2024. This borrowing was repaid in October 2024 in advance of its maturity. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s remaining borrowing capacity with the BTFP was 18.0 million and its remaining borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Discount Window was 11.8 billion. 
 In addition to borrowing capacity with the FHLB and at the Federal Reserve Discount Window as described above, the Company had additional liquidity of 11.4 billion available via cash, unpledged bond collateral, the federal funds market, and the IntraFi Cash Service program as of September 30, 2024. 
 Risk-based capital guidelines established by regulatory agencies set minimum capital standards based on the level of risk associated with a financial institution s assets. The Company has implemented the Basel III regulatory capital rules adopted by the FRB. Basel III capital rules include a minimum ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5 and a minimum tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6 . A financial institution s total capital is also required to equal at least 8 of risk-weighted assets. 
 The risk-based capital guidelines indicate the specific risk weightings by type of asset. Certain off-balance sheet items (such as standby letters of credit and binding loan commitments) are multiplied by credit conversion factors to translate them into balance sheet equivalents before assigning them specific risk weightings. The Company is also required to maintain a leverage ratio equal to or greater than 4 . The leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of tier 1 core capital to total average assets, less goodwill and intangibles. 
 U.S. banking agencies in December 2018 approved a final rule to address the impact of CECL on regulatory capital by allowing banking organizations the option to phase in the day-one impact of CECL until the first quarter of 2023. In March 2020, the U.S. banking agencies issued an interim final rule that provides banking organizations with an alternative option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL s effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. The Company elected this alternative option instead of the one described in the December 2018 rule.

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements 
 The Company s main off-balance sheet arrangements are loan commitments, commercial and standby letters of credit, futures contracts and forward exchange contracts, which have maturity dates rather than payment due dates. See Note 10, Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed information on these arrangements. The level of the outstanding commitments could be impacted by volatility in the economic markets and governmental responses to inflation, geopolitical tensions, and supply chain constraints. These changing conditions could have impacts on the consolidated balance sheets of the Company for the remainder of the year 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to customers and suppliers, allowance for credit losses, bad debts, investments, financing operations, long-lived assets, taxes, other contingencies, and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which have formed the basis for making such judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Under different assumptions or conditions, actual results may differ from the recorded estimates. 
 A summary of critical accounting policies is listed in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of the Form 10-K.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Risk Management 
 Market risk is a broad term for the risk of economic loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of a financial instrument. These changes may be the result of various factors, including interest rates, foreign exchange prices, commodity prices, or equity prices. Financial instruments that are subject to market risk can be classified either as held for trading or held for purposes other than trading. 
 The Company is subject to market risk primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates of its assets held for purposes other than trading. The following discussion of interest rate risk, however, combines instruments held for trading and instruments held for purposes other than trading because the instruments held for trading represent such a small portion of the Company s portfolio that the interest rate risk associated with them is immaterial. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 In the banking industry, a major risk exposure is changing interest rates. To minimize the effect of interest rate changes to net interest income and exposure levels to economic losses, the Company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates through asset and liability management within guidelines established by its Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) and approved by the Board. The ALCO is responsible for approving and ensuring compliance with asset/liability management policies, including interest rate exposure. The Company s primary method for measuring and analyzing consolidated interest rate risk is the Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis. The Company also uses a Net Portfolio Value model to measure market value risk under various rate change scenarios and a gap analysis to measure maturity and repricing relationships between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities at specific points in time. On a limited basis, the Company uses hedges such as swaps, rate floors, floor spreads, and futures contracts to manage interest rate risk on certain loans, securities, and trust preferred securities. See further information in Note 11 Derivatives and Hedging Activities in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Overall, the Company manages interest rate risk by positioning the balance sheet to maximize net interest income while maintaining an acceptable level of interest rate and credit risk, remaining mindful of the relationship among profitability, liquidity, interest rate risk, and credit risk. 
 Net Interest Income Modeling 
 The Company s primary interest rate risk tool, the Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis, measures interest rate risk and the effect of interest rate changes on net interest income and net interest margin. This analysis incorporates all of the Company s assets and liabilities together with assumptions that reflect the current interest rate environment. Through these simulations, management estimates the impact on net interest income of a 200-basis-point upward or a 300-basis-point downward gradual change (e.g. ramp) and immediate change (e.g. shock) of market interest rates over a two year period. In ramp scenarios, rates change gradually for a one-year period and remain constant in year two. In shock scenarios, rates change immediately and the change is sustained for the remainder of the two-year scenario horizon. Assumptions are made to project rates for new loans and deposits based on historical analysis, management outlook and repricing strategies. Asset prepayments and other market risks are developed from industry estimates of prepayment speeds and other market changes. The results of these simulations can be significantly influenced by assumptions utilized and management evaluates the sensitivity of the simulation results on a regular basis. 
 Table 14 shows the net interest income increase or decrease over the next two years as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 based on hypothetical changes in interest rates and a constant sized balance sheet with runoff being replaced.

The Company is liability sensitive to changes in interest rates in the next year. Net interest income is predicted to decrease in all upward rate scenarios and increase in all downward rate scenarios. In year two, net interest income is predicted to increase in all upward rate scenarios. In down rate scenarios net interest income is predicted to increase in rate ramp scenarios and decrease in rate shock scenarios except for the down 100bps shock scenario. The Company s ability to price deposits consistent with its historical approach is a key assumption in these scenarios. 
 Trading Account 
 The Company carries securities in a trading account that is maintained according to Board-approved policy and procedures. The policy limits the amount and type of securities that can be carried in the trading account, requires compliance with any limits under applicable law and regulations, and mandates the use of a value-at-risk methodology to manage price volatility risks within financial parameters. The risk associated with the carrying of trading securities is offset by utilizing financial instruments including exchange-traded financial futures as well as short sales of U.S. Treasury and Corporate securities. The trading securities and related hedging instruments are marked-to-market daily. The trading account had a balance of 35.8 million as of September 30, 2024, 18.1 million as of December 31, 2023, and 24.5 million as of September 30, 2023. Securities sold not yet purchased (i.e., short positions) totaled 11.3 million at September 30, 2024, 8.0 million as of December 31, 2023, and 9.7 million at September 30, 2023 and are classified within the Other liabilities line of the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 80 

The Company is subject to market risk primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates of its assets held for purposes other than trading. The discussion in Table 14 above of interest rate risk, however, combines instruments held for trading and instruments held for purposes other than trading, because the instruments held for trading represent such a small portion of the Company s portfolio that the interest rate risk associated with them is immaterial. 
 Other Market Risk 
 The Company has minimal foreign currency risk as a result of foreign exchange contracts. See Note 10 Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Credit Risk Management 
 Credit risk represents the risk that a customer or counterparty may not perform in accordance with contractual terms. The Company utilizes a centralized credit administration function, which provides information on the Bank s risk levels, delinquencies, an internal ranking system and overall credit exposure. Loan requests are centrally reviewed to ensure the consistent application of the loan policy and standards. In addition, the Company has an internal loan review staff that operates independently of the Bank. This review team performs periodic examinations of the Bank s loans for credit quality, documentation and loan administration. The respective regulatory authorities governing the Bank also review loan portfolios. 
 A primary indicator of credit quality and risk management is the level of nonperforming loans. Nonperforming loans include both nonaccrual loans and restructured loans on nonaccrual. The Company s nonperforming loans increased 2.2 million to 19.3 million at September 30, 2024, compared to September 30, 2023, and increased 6.1 million, compared to December 31, 2023. 
 The Company had 1.9 million and 1.7 million of other real estate owned as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Loans past due more than 90 days and still accruing interest totaled 7.1 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 3.0 million at September 30, 2023 and 3.1 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 A loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when payments are past due 90 days or more and/or when management has considerable doubt about the borrower s ability to repay on the terms originally contracted. The accrual of interest is discontinued and recorded thereafter only when received in cash. 
 Certain loans are restructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal due to deterioration in the financial condition of the respective borrowers. The Company had 200 thousand of restructured loans at September 30, 2024, 3.2 million at September 30, 2023, and 548 thousand at December 31, 2023.

Liquidity Risk 
 Liquidity represents the Company s ability to meet financial commitments through the maturity and sale of existing assets or availability of additional funds. The Company believes that the most important factor in the preservation of liquidity is maintaining public confidence that facilitates the retention and growth of a large, stable supply of core deposits and wholesale funds. Ultimately, the Company believes public confidence is generated through profitable operations, sound credit quality and a strong capital position. The primary source of liquidity for the Company is regularly scheduled payments on and maturity of assets, which include 7.0 billion of high-quality securities available for sale as of September 30, 2024. The liquidity of the Company and the Bank is also enhanced by its activity in the federal funds market and by its core deposits. Additionally, management believes it can raise debt or equity capital in the future, should the need arise. 
 Another factor affecting liquidity is the amount of deposits and customer repurchase agreements that have pledging requirements. All customer repurchase agreements require collateral in the form of a security. The U.S. Government, other public entities, and certain trust depositors require the Company to pledge securities if their deposit balances are greater than the FDIC-insured deposit limitations. These pledging requirements affect liquidity risk in that the related security cannot otherwise be disposed of due to the pledging restriction. There were 9.4 billion and 10.1 billion of securities pledged to secure U.S. Government deposits, other public deposits, certain trust deposits, derivative transactions, and repurchase agreements at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 The Company also has other commercial commitments that may impact liquidity. These commitments include unused commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of credit. The total amount of these commercial commitments at September 30, 2024 was 18.8 billion. Since many of these commitments expire without being drawn upon, the total amount of these commercial commitments does not necessarily represent the future cash requirements of the Company. 
 The Company s cash requirements consist primarily of dividends to shareholders, debt service, operating expenses, and treasury stock purchases. Management fees and dividends received from bank and non-bank subsidiaries traditionally have been sufficient to satisfy these requirements and are expected to be sufficient in the future. The Bank is subject to various rules regarding payment of dividends to the Company. For the most part, the Bank can pay dividends at least equal to its current year s earnings without seeking prior regulatory approval. The 
 82 

Company also uses cash to inject capital into its bank and non-bank subsidiaries to maintain adequate capital as well as fund strategic initiatives. 
 In September 2022, the Company issued 110.0 million in aggregate subordinated notes due in September 2032. The Company received 107.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, and used the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including, among other uses, contributing Tier 1 capital into the Bank. The subordinated notes were issued with a fixed-to-fixed rate of 6.25 and an effective rate of 6.64 , due to issuance costs, with an interest rate reset date of September 2027. 
 In September 2020, the Company issued 200.0 million in aggregate subordinated notes due in September 2030. The Company received 197.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, and used the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including, among other uses, contributing Tier 1 capital into the Bank. The subordinated notes were issued with a fixed-to-fixed rate of 3.70 and an effective rate of 3.93 , due to issuance costs, with an interest rate reset date of September 2025. 
 To enhance general working capital needs, the Company has a revolving line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., which allows the Company to borrow up to 30.0 million for general working capital purposes. The interest rate applied to borrowed balances will be at the Company s option, either 1.4 above SOFR or 1.75 below the prime rate on the date of an advance. The Company pays a 0.4 unused commitment fee for unused portions of the line of credit. The Company had no advances outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 
 The Company is a member bank of the FHLB. The Company owns 21.4 million of FHLB stock and has access to additional liquidity and funding sources through FHLB advances. The Company s borrowing capacity is dependent upon the amount of collateral the Company places at the FHLB. The Company had a 250.0 million short-term advance outstanding at FHLB of Des Moines as of September 30, 2024, at an interest rate of 5.47 . This borrowing matured in October 2024. Additionally, during 2024, the FHLB of Des Moines issued a letter of credit for 150.0 million on behalf of the Company to secure deposits. This letter of credit expired in October 2024, was renewed, and will expire in January 2025. The Company s remaining borrowing capacity with the FHLB was 1.6 billion as of September 30, 2024. 
 The Company had an 800.0 million short-term borrowing outstanding with the Federal Reserve Bank's BTFP as of September 30, 2024 at an interest rate of 4.76 . This borrowing was repaid in October 2024 in advance of its maturity. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s remaining borrowing capacity with the BTFP was 18.0 million and its remaining borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Discount Window was 11.8 billion. 
 In addition to borrowing capacity with the FHLB and at the Federal Reserve Discount Window as described above, the Company had additional liquidity of 11.4 billion available via cash, unpledged bond collateral, the federal funds market, and the IntraFi Cash Service program as of September 30, 2024. 
 Operational Risk 
 Operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from the Company s operations, including those operations performed for the Company by third parties. This would include but is not limited to the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside the Company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees or others, errors relating to transaction processing, breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements, and unplanned interruptions in service. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal or regulatory actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency, or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards. The Company must comply with a number of legal and regulatory requirements. 
 The Company operates in many markets and relies on the ability of its employees and systems to properly process a high number of transactions. In the event of a breakdown in internal control systems, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, the Company could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action and suffer damage to its reputation. In order to address this risk, management maintains a system of internal controls with the objective of providing proper transaction authorization and execution, safeguarding of assets from misuse or theft, and ensuring the reliability of financial and other data. 
 83 

The Company maintains systems of internal controls that provide management with timely and accurate information about the Company s operations. These systems have been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate levels given the Company s financial strength, the environment in which it operates, and considering factors such as competition and regulation. The Company has also established procedures that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct, ethics, and business practices are followed on a uniform basis. In certain cases, the Company has experienced losses from operational risk. Such losses have included the effects of operational errors that the Company has discovered and included as expense in the statement of income. While there can be no assurance that the Company will not suffer such losses in the future, management continually monitors and works to improve its internal controls, systems, and corporate-wide processes and procedures. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, requires the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer to make certain certifications under this Form 10-Q with respect to the Company s disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. The Company has a Code of Ethics that expresses the values that drive employee behavior and maintains the Company s commitment to the highest standards of ethics.
