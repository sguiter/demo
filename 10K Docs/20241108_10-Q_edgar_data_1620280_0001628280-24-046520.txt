 primary lines of business: Uniti Fiber and Uniti Leasing. 
 The Company operates through a customary up-REIT structure, pursuant to which we hold substantially all of our assets through a partnership, Uniti Group LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the Operating Partnership that we control as general partner. The up-REIT structure is intended to facilitate future acquisition opportunities by providing the Company with the ability to use common units of the Operating Partnership as a tax-efficient acquisition currency. As of September 30, 2024, we are the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and own approximately of the partnership interests in the Operating Partnership. 
 Our Proposed Merger with Windstream 
 On May 3, 2024, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Windstream Holdings II, LLC (the Merger Agreement providing for a combination of the Company and Windstream Holdings, Inc. (together with Windstream Holdings II, LLC, its successor in interest, and its subsidiaries, Windstream such that, following a pre-closing reorganization of Windstream and the merger of the Company into an entity formed in such reorganization (the "Merger"), both the Company and Windstream will be indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of a recently formed company that in the reorganization will become the parent company of Windstream New Uniti ). Following the Merger, the common stock of New Uniti New Uniti Common Stock is expected to be listed on the Nasdaq. 
 The Merger intends to reunite Windstream s business with the underlying fiber infrastructure owned by the Company to create a premier digital infrastructure company with a strong platform for value creation. Upon consummation of the Merger, the board of directors of New Uniti will initially comprise members, including directors to be appointed by Uniti. It is expected that Uniti s existing officers will serve as initial officers of New Uniti. 
 
 At the effective time of the Merger, each share of Uniti s common stock that is issued and outstanding will automatically be cancelled and retired and converted into the right to a number of shares of New Uniti Common Stock pursuant to an exchange ratio set forth in the Merger Agreement such that the Company's and Windstream's stockholders are expected to hold approximately and , respectively, of the combined company before giving effect to the conversion of any outstanding convertible securities or the issuance of warrants to purchase New Uniti Common Stock referenced below. 
 
 In addition, at the closing of the Merger, we will fund an aggregate cash payment of million (less certain transaction expenses) that will be distributed to Windstream equityholders on a pro-rata basis (the Merger Cash Consideration ). Windstream equityholders will also be entitled to pro rata distributions of (i) new shares of non-voting preferred stock of New Uniti with a dividend rate of per year for the first , subject to an additional per year during each of the seven th and eight h year after the initial issuance and further increased by an additional per year during each subsequent year, subject to a cap of per year and with an aggregate liquidation preference of million, and (ii) warrants to purchase New Uniti Common Stock, with an exercise price of per share, subject to customary adjustments, representing in the aggregate approximately of the pro forma share total of New Uniti. We intend to fund the Merger Cash Consideration with cash on hand and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein). 
 
 Our Merger with Windstream is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among others, approval by our stockholders and receipt of required regulatory approvals, including the expiration or early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and the receipt of approvals from the Federal Communications Commission and certain state public utility commissions. We currently expect our Merger with Windstream to close in 2025. 
 
 Upon consummation of the Merger, New Uniti will become an integrated telecommunications company. Initially, the legacy Uniti and Windstream organizational structures will remain separate, and the existing agreements and arrangements presently in effect between Uniti and Windstream, such as the Windstream Leases and the settlement agreement with

 CableSouth Transaction 
 In 2018, we acquired certain fiber assets from CableSouth Media, LLC CableSouth and leased back certain of those acquired assets to CableSouth pursuant to a triple-net lease. 
 
 During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with a fund managed by Macquarie Asset Management ("MAM") pursuant to which MAM would make a structured equity investment into CableSouth in order to assist CableSouth in the acquisition of all of our previously acquired CableSouth fiber assets and the buyout of their triple-net lease for cash consideration of million (the "CableSouth Transaction"). The Company completed the CableSouth Transaction on January 31, 2024 and recorded a million gain on sale of real estate in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). 
 
 The CableSouth Transaction is included in the results of the Uniti Leasing segment, and because the sale does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on operations and financial results, it does not qualify for presentation as a discontinued operation.

The Note Hedge Transactions covered, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the Exchangeable Notes, the same number of shares of the Company s common stock that initially underlie the Exchangeable Notes in the aggregate and were exercisable upon exchange of the Exchangeable Notes. The Note Hedge Transactions had an initial strike price that corresponded to the initial exchange price of the Exchangeable Notes, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the Exchangeable Notes.

Convertible Notes due December 1, 2027 (the "Convertible 2027 Notes"), the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the Capped Calls with certain financial institutions at a cost of million. The Capped Calls cover the same number of shares of the Company s common stock that initially underlie the Convertible 2027 Notes in the aggregate. By entering into the Capped Calls, the Company expects to reduce the potential dilution to its common stock (or, in the event a conversion of the Convertible 2027 Notes is settled in cash, to reduce its cash payment obligation) in the event that at the time of conversion of the Convertible 2027 Notes its common stock price exceeds the conversion price of the Convertible 2027 Notes. The cap price of the Capped Calls will initially be per share of common stock, which represents a premium of over the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock of per share on December 7, 2022 and is subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the Convertible 2027 Notes. The Company used approximately million of the net proceeds from the offering of the Convertible 2027 Notes to pay for the cost of the Capped Calls. The Capped Calls meet the criteria for classification in equity, are not remeasured each reporting period and are included as a reduction to additional paid-in-capital within stockholders equity. 
 Additionally on December 7, 2022, in connection with the Company s repurchase of the Exchangeable Notes, the Company entered into partial unwind agreements with the Counterparties to unwind a portion of the Note Hedge Transactions and the Warrants described above (collectively, the Unwind Transactions ). In connection with the Unwind Transactions, the Company received cash as a termination payment for the portion of the Note Hedge Transactions that were unwound, and the Company delivered cash as a termination payment in respect of the portion of the Warrants that were unwound. The amount of cash that was received, which was approximately million, and the amount of cash that was delivered to the Counterparties, which was approximately million, were based generally on the termination values of the unwound portions of such instruments.

 In accordance with ASC 350-20, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other ("ASC 350-20"), we evaluate goodwill for impairment 
 between annual impairment tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount (a Triggering Event ). During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company identified a Triggering Event and, therefore, performed a qualitative and quantitative goodwill impairment test. The Triggering Event was a result of macroeconomic and financial market factors, specifically increased interest rates, impacting our discount rate. As a result of this interim assessment of goodwill, we concluded that the fair value of the Uniti Fiber segment, estimated using a combination of the income approach and market approach, was less than its carrying amount. Accordingly, we recorded a million million net of tax) goodwill impairment charge in the Uniti Fiber segment during the three months ended September 30, 2023 (as restated).

 million of cash payments to Windstream in equal installments over consecutive quarters beginning in October 2020, and Uniti may prepay any installments due on or after the first anniversary of the settlement agreement (discounted at a rate). As of September 30, 2024, the Company has made payments totaling million. 
 Further, beginning in October 2020, we became obligated to reimburse Windstream for up to an aggregate of billion for certain growth capital improvements in long-term fiber and related assets made by Windstream Growth Capital Improvements through 2029. Uniti s reimbursement commitment for Growth Capital Improvements does not require Uniti to reimburse Windstream for maintenance or repair expenditures (except for costs incurred for fiber replacements to the property leased under the competitive local exchange carrier master lease agreement, up to million during the term), and each such reimbursement is subject to underwriting standards. Uniti s total annual reimbursement commitments for the Growth Capital Improvements under both Windstream Leases (and under separate equipment loan facilities) were limited to million in 2023, and are limited to million per year in 2024; million per year in 2025 and 2026; and million per year in 2027 through 2029. If the cost incurred by Windstream (or the successor tenant under a Windstream Lease) for Growth Capital Improvements in any calendar year exceeds the annual limit for such calendar year, Windstream (or such tenant, as the case may be) may submit such excess costs for reimbursement in any subsequent year and such excess costs shall be funded from the annual commitment amounts in such subsequent period. In addition, to the extent that reimbursements for Growth Capital Improvements funded in any calendar year during the term is less than the annual limit for such calendar year, the unfunded amount in any calendar year will carry-over and may be added to the annual limits for subsequent calendar years, subject to an annual limit of million in any calendar year. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Uniti reimbursed million of Growth Capital Improvements, of which million represented the reimbursement of capital improvements completed in 2023 that were previously classified as tenant funded capital improvements. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we have reimbursed a total of billion of Growth Capital Improvements. 
 Starting on the first anniversary of each installment of reimbursement for a Growth Capital Improvement, the rent payable by Windstream under the applicable Windstream Lease will increase by an amount equal to (the Rent Rate of such installment of reimbursement. The Rent Rate will thereafter increase to of the prior Rent Rate on each anniversary of each reimbursement. In the event that the tenant s interest in either Windstream Lease is transferred by Windstream under the terms thereof (unless transferred to the same transferee), or if Uniti transfers its interests as landlord under either Windstream Lease (unless to the same transferee), the reimbursement rights and obligations will be allocated between the ILEC MLA and the CLEC MLA by Windstream, provided that the maximum that may be allocated to the CLEC MLA following such transfer is million per year. If Uniti fails to reimburse any Growth Capital Improvement reimbursement payment or equipment loan funding request as and when it is required to do so under the terms of the Windstream Leases, and such failure continues for ) days, then such unreimbursed amounts may be applied as an offset against the rent owed by Windstream under the Windstream Leases (and such amounts will thereafter be treated as if Uniti had reimbursed them). 
 Uniti and Windstream have entered into separate ILEC and CLEC Equipment Loan and Security Agreements (collectively Equipment Loan Agreement in which Uniti will provide up to million (limited to million in any calendar year) of the billion of Growth Capital Improvements commitments discussed above in the form of loans for Windstream to purchase equipment related to network upgrades or to be used in connection with the Windstream Leases. Interest on these loans will accrue at from the date of the borrowing. All equipment financed through the Equipment Loan Agreement is the sole property of Windstream; however, Uniti will receive a first-lien security interest in the equipment purchased with the loans.

 On April 24, 2015, we were separated and spun-off (the Spin-Off from Windstream Holdings, Inc. Windstream Holdings and together with Windstream Holdings II, LLC, its successor in interest, and its subsidiaries, Windstream pursuant to which Windstream contributed certain telecommunications network assets, including fiber and copper networks and other real estate (the Distribution Systems and a small consumer competitive local exchange carrier CLEC business (the Consumer CLEC Business to Uniti and Uniti issued common stock and indebtedness and paid cash obtained from borrowings under Uniti s senior credit facilities to Windstream. In connection with the Spin-Off, we entered

 into a long-term exclusive triple-net lease (the Master Lease with Windstream, pursuant to which a substantial portion of our real property is leased to Windstream and from which a substantial portion of our leasing revenues are currently derived. In connection with Windstream s emergence from bankruptcy, Uniti and Windstream bifurcated the Master Lease and entered into two structurally similar master leases (collectively, the Windstream Leases ), which amended and restated the Master Lease in its entirety. The Windstream Leases consist of (a) a master lease (the ILEC MLA that governs Uniti owned assets used for Windstream s incumbent local exchange carrier ILEC operations and (b) a master lease (the CLEC MLA that governs Uniti owned assets used for Windstream s CLEC operations. 
 Uniti operates as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, the Company is generally not subject to U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by its REIT operations, which includes income derived from the Windstream Leases . We have elected to treat the subsidiaries through which we operate our fiber business, Uniti Fiber, and certain aspects of our leasing business, Uniti Leasing, as taxable REIT subsidiaries TRSs ). TRSs enable us to engage in activities that result in income that does not constitute qualifying income for a REIT. Our TRSs are subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate income taxes. 
 The Company operates through a customary "up-REIT" structure, pursuant to which we hold substantially all of our assets through a partnership, Uniti Group LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the Operating Partnership ), that we control as general partner. The up-REIT structure is intended to facilitate future acquisition opportunities by providing the Company with the ability to use common units of the Operating Partnership as a tax-efficient acquisition currency. As of September 30, 2024, we are the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and own approximately 99.98 of the partnership interests in the Operating Partnership. In addition, we have undertaken a series of transactions to permit us to hold certain assets through subsidiaries that are taxed as REITs, which may also facilitate future acquisition opportunities. 
 We aim to grow and diversify our portfolio and tenant base by pursuing a range of transaction structures with communication service providers, including (i) sale-leaseback transactions, whereby we acquire existing infrastructure assets from third parties, including communication service providers, and lease them back on a long-term triple-net basis; (ii) leasing of dark fiber and selling of lit services on our existing fiber network assets that we either constructed or acquired; (iii) whole company acquisitions, which may include the use of one or more TRSs that are permitted under the tax laws to acquire and operate non-REIT businesses and assets subject to certain limitations; (iv) capital investment financing, whereby we offer communication service providers a cost efficient method of raising funds for discrete capital investments to upgrade or expand their network; and (v) mergers and acquisitions financing, whereby we facilitate mergers and acquisition transactions as a capital partner, including through operating company-property company OpCo-PropCo structures. 
 Segments 
 We manage our operations as two reportable business segments, in addition to our corporate operations, which include: 
 Uniti Leasing : Represents the operations of our leasing business, which is engaged in the acquisition and construction of mission-critical communications assets and leasing them to anchor customers on either an exclusive or shared-tenant basis, in addition to the leasing of dark fiber on our existing dark fiber network assets that we either constructed or acquired. While the Leasing segment represents our REIT operations, certain aspects of the Leasing segment are also operated through TRSs. 
 Uniti Fiber : Represents the operations of our fiber business which is a leading provider of infrastructure solutions, including cell site backhaul and dark fiber, to the telecommunications industry. 
 Corporate : Represents our corporate office and shared service functions. Certain costs and expenses, primarily related to headcount, information technology systems, insurance, professional fees and similar charges, that are directly attributable to operations of our business segments are allocated to the respective segments. 
 We evaluate the performance of each segment based on Adjusted EBITDA, which is a segment performance measure we define as net income determined in accordance with GAAP, before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and the impact, which may be recurring in nature, of transaction and integration related costs, costs associated with Windstream s bankruptcy, costs associated with litigation claims made against us, costs associated with the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system, goodwill impairment charges, severance costs, costs related to the settlement with Windstream, amortization of non-cash rights-of-use assets, the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs, costs incurred as a result of the early repayment of debt,

Table of Contents 

 including early tender and redemption premiums and costs associated with the termination of related hedging activities, gains or losses on dispositions, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration and financial instruments, and other similar or infrequent items (although we may not have had such charges in the periods presented). Adjusted EBITDA includes adjustments to reflect the Company s share of Adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated entities . For more information on Adjusted EBITDA, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures. Detailed information about our segments can be found in Note 12 to our accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I, Item 1 "Financial Statements" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Significant Business Developments 
 Our Proposed Merger with Windstream 
 On May 3, 2024, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Windstream Holdings II, LLC (the Merger Agreement providing for a combination of the Company and Windstream such that, following a pre-closing reorganization of Windstream and the merger of the Company into an entity formed in such reorganization (the "Merger"), both the Company and Windstream will be indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of a recently formed company that in the reorganization will become the parent company of Windstream New Uniti ). Following the Merger, the common stock of New Uniti New Uniti Common Stock is expected to be listed on the Nasdaq. 
 The Merger intends to reunite Windstream s business with the underlying fiber infrastructure owned by the Company to create a premier digital infrastructure company with a strong platform for value creation. Upon consummation of the Merger, the board of directors of New Uniti will initially comprise nine members, including five directors to be appointed by Uniti. It is expected that Uniti s existing officers will serve as initial officers of New Uniti. 
 
 At the effective time of the Merger, each share of Uniti s common stock that is issued and outstanding will automatically be cancelled and retired and converted into the right to a number of shares of New Uniti Common Stock pursuant to an exchange ratio set forth in the Merger Agreement such that the Company's and Windstream's stockholders are expected to hold approximately 62 and 38 , respectively, of the combined company before giving effect to the conversion of any outstanding convertible securities or the issuance of warrants to purchase New Uniti Common Stock referenced below. 
 
 In addition, at the closing of the Merger, we will fund an aggregate cash payment of 425 million (less certain transaction expenses) that will be distributed to Windstream equityholders on a pro-rata basis (the Merger Cash Consideration ). Windstream equityholders will also be entitled to pro rata distributions of (i) new shares of non-voting preferred stock of New Uniti with a dividend rate of 11 per year for the first six years, subject to an additional 0.5 per year during each of the seventh and eighth year after the initial issuance and further increased by an additional 1 per year during each subsequent year, subject to a cap of 16 per year and with an aggregate liquidation preference of 575 million, and (ii) warrants to purchase New Uniti Common Stock, with an exercise price of 0.01 per share, subject to customary adjustments, representing in the aggregate approximately 6.9 of the pro forma share total of New Uniti. We intend to fund the Merger Cash Consideration with cash on hand and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein). 
 
 Our Merger with Windstream is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among others, approval by our 
 stockholders and receipt of required regulatory approvals, including the expiration or early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and the receipt of approvals from the Federal Communications Commission and certain state public utility commissions. We currently expect our Merger with Windstream to close in 2025. 
 
 Upon consummation of the Merger, New Uniti will become an integrated telecommunications company. Initially, the legacy Uniti and Windstream organizational structures will remain separate, and the existing agreements and arrangements presently in effect between Uniti and Windstream, such as the Windstream Leases and the settlement agreement with Windstream, which requires Uniti to fund periodic settlement payments and reimburse Windstream for certain growth capital improvements, will remain in place. All Windstream debt obligations would remain obligations of Windstream and our debt obligations would remain as ours, with no cross-guarantees or credit support between the Company and Windstream. For a description of the Windstream Leases and the settlement agreement with Windstream, refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources Windstream Leases within Part I, Item 2 "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In September and October 2024, Windstream undertook a series of transactions through which it amended the terms of its outstanding debt to, among other things, allow for the consolidation of Uniti's and Windstream's debt following the completion of the Merger into a single silo under a common parent entity (the "Post-Closing Reorganization"). As a result, following the completion of the Merger, Uniti may, but is not required to, consummate the Post-Closing Reorganization. If the Post-Closing Reorganization 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 is completed, certain existing agreements and arrangements presently in effect between Uniti and Windstream, including the Windstream Leases and the settlement agreement described above, could be (but are not required to be) terminated. In addition, if the Post-Closing Reorganization is completed, each obligor under Uniti's outstanding debt (other than the ABS Loan Facility) would become an obligor under Windstream's outstanding debt, and each obligor under Windstream's outstanding debt would become an obligor under Uniti's outstanding debt (other than the ABS Loan Facility). 
 
 In addition, we have agreed to suspend dividend payments or other distributions until the consummation of the Merger, except for the dividend paid on June 28, 2024 and those dividends reasonably required for us or our subsidiaries to maintain our status as a REIT or to avoid the payment or imposition of income or excise tax, among other customary exceptions. Finally, it is expected that, following consummation of the Merger, Uniti will cease to be a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

 Uniti Leasing Uniti Leasing revenues are primarily attributable to rental revenue from leasing our Distribution Systems to Windstream pursuant to the Windstream Leases. Under the Windstream Leases, Windstream is responsible for the costs related to operating the Distribution Systems, including property taxes, insurance, and maintenance and repair costs. As a result, we do not record an obligation related to the payment of property taxes, as Windstream makes direct payments to the taxing authorities. The initial term of the Windstream Leases expires on April 30, 2030. Annual rent under the Windstream Leases for the full year 2024 is 675.6 million and is subject to annual escalation at a rate of 0.5 . For a description of the Windstream Leases, see Liquidity and Capital Resources Windstream Leases below. 
 The rent for the first year of each renewal term under the Windstream Leases will be an amount agreed to by us and Windstream. While the agreements require that the renewal rent be "Fair Market Rent," if we are unable to agree, the renewal Fair Market Rent will be determined by an independent appraisal process. Commencing with the second year of each renewal term, the renewal rent will increase at an escalation rate of 0.5 . 
 Pursuant to the Windstream Leases, Windstream (or any successor tenant under a Windstream Lease) has the right to cause Uniti to reimburse up to an aggregate 1.75 billion for certain growth capital improvements in long-term value accretive fiber and related assets made by Windstream (or the applicable tenant under the Windstream Lease) to certain ILEC and CLEC properties (the Growth Capital Improvements or GCIs ). Uniti s total annual reimbursement commitments to Windstream for the Growth Capital Improvements is discussed below in Liquidity and Capital Resources Windstream Leases. 
 Starting on the first anniversary of each installment of reimbursement for a Growth Capital Improvement, the rent payable by Windstream under the applicable Windstream Lease will increase by an amount equal to 8.0 (the Rent Rate of such installment of reimbursement. The Rent Rate will thereafter increase to 100.5 of the prior Rent Rate on each anniversary of each reimbursement. In the event that the tenant s interest in either Windstream Lease is transferred by Windstream under the terms thereof (unless transferred to the same transferee), or if Uniti transfers its interests as landlord under either Windstream Lease (unless to the same transferee), the reimbursement rights and obligations will be allocated between the ILEC MLA and the CLEC MLA by Windstream, provided that the maximum that may be allocated to the CLEC MLA following such transfer is 20.0 million per year. If Uniti fails to reimburse any Growth Capital Improvement payment or

 equipment loan funding request as and when it is required to do so under the terms of the Windstream Leases, and such failure continues for thirty (30) days, then such unreimbursed amounts may be applied as an offset against the rent owed by Windstream under the Windstream Leases (and such amounts will thereafter be treated as if Uniti had reimbursed them). 
 
 The Windstream Leases provide that tenant funded capital improvements TCIs ), defined as maintenance, repair, overbuild, upgrade or replacement to the Distribution Systems, including without limitation, the replacement of copper distribution systems with fiber distribution systems, automatically become property of Uniti upon their construction by Windstream. We receive non-monetary consideration related to TCIs as they automatically become our property, and we recognize the cost basis of TCIs that are capital in nature as property, plant, and equipment and deferred revenue. We depreciate the property, plant, and equipment over their estimated useful lives and amortize the deferred revenue as additional leasing revenues over the same depreciable life of the TCI assets. TCIs exclude Growth Capital Improvements as and when reimbursed by Uniti. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (Thousands) Amount of Segment Revenues Amount of Segment Revenues (as restated) Uniti Leasing revenues: Windstream Leases: Cash revenue Cash rent 169,180 75.9 168,338 78.5 GCI revenue 14,613 6.6 8,450 3.9 Total cash revenue 183,793 82.5 176,788 82.4 Non-cash revenue TCI revenue 12,791 5.7 11,707 5.4 GCI revenue 3,136 1.4 4,436 2.1 Other straight-line revenue 558 0.2 1,401 0.7 Total non-cash revenue 16,485 7.3 17,544 8.2 Total Windstream revenue 200,278 89.8 194,332 90.6 Other services 22,644 10.2 20,256 9.4 Total Uniti Leasing revenues 222,922 100.0 214,588 100.0 
 The increase in TCI revenue is attributable to continued investment by Windstream. Windstream invested 69.6 million in TCIs during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The total amount invested in TCIs by Windstream since the inception of the Windstream Leases (including the Master Lease) was 1.3 billion as of September 30, 2024 and 1.1 billion as of September 30, 2023. 
 The increase in GCI revenue is attributable to Uniti s continued reimbursement of Growth Capital Improvements. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, Uniti reimbursed 34.2 million of Growth Capital Improvements. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we have reimbursed a total of 1.0 billion of Growth Capital Improvements. 
 We recognized 22.6 million and 20.3 million of revenues from other services including non-Windstream triple-net leasing and dark fiber indefeasible rights of use IRU arrangements for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase is primarily driven by revenues from new customer arrangements. 
 Because a substantial portion of our revenue and cash flows are derived from lease payments by Windstream pursuant to the Windstream Leases, there could be a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, financial condition and/or ability to maintain our status as a REIT and service debt if Windstream were to become unable to generate sufficient cash to make payments to us . 
 We monitor the credit quality of Windstream through numerous methods, including by (i) reviewing credit ratings of Windstream by nationally recognized credit agencies, (ii) reviewing the financial statements of Windstream that are required to be delivered to us pursuant to the Windstream Leases, (iii) monitoring new reports regarding Windstream and its business, (iv) conducting research to ascertain industry trends potentially affecting Windstream, (v) monitoring

 Windstream s compliance with the terms of the Windstream Leases and (vi) monitoring the timeliness of its payments under the Windstream Leases. 
 As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, Windstream is current on all lease payments. Moody's Investor Service's current corporate family rating for Windstream is B3 with a stable outlook. S P Global Ratings' current issuer rating for Windstream is B- with a stable outlook. In addition, in order to assist us in our continuing assessment of Windstream s creditworthiness, we periodically receive certain confidential financial information and metrics from Windstream.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Uniti Fiber revenues totaled 69.3 million as compared to 76.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Uniti Fiber revenues decreased 6.7 million, primarily attributable to a 4.6 million decrease in E-rate and government, driven primarily by non-recurring equipment and installation sales, and a 4.2 million decrease in dark fiber and small cells, driven primarily by one-time cancellation revenues, partially offset by a 2.2 million increase in enterprise and wholesale, driven primarily by increased customer connections.

 Goodwill Impairment 
 During the third quarter of 2023, as a result of macroeconomic and financial market factors, specifically, increased interest rates impacting our discount rate, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Uniti Fiber segment, estimated using a combination of the income approach and market approach, was less that its carrying amount. Accordingly, we recorded a 204.0 million 151.9 million net of tax) goodwill impairment in the Uniti Fiber segment during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We recorded no impairment during the three months ended September 30, 2024. See Note 9 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Transaction Related and Other Costs 
 Transaction related and other costs include incremental acquisition, pursuit, transaction and integration costs (including unsuccessful acquisition pursuit costs). For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 14.4 million of transaction related and other costs, compared to 1.4 million of such costs during the three months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase is primarily attributable to costs associated with the Merger.

 The increase in TCI revenue is attributable to continued investment by Windstream. 
 The increase in GCI revenue is attributable to Uniti s continued reimbursement of Growth Capital Improvements. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Uniti reimbursed 230.8 million of Growth Capital Improvements. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we have reimbursed a total of 1.0 billion of Growth Capital Improvements. 
 We recognized 62.8 million and 59.6 million of revenues from non-Windstream triple-net leasing, dark fiber IRU arrangements, and other services for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase is primarily attributable to revenues from new customer arrangements.

 Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 7.6 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to a loss on extinguishment of debt of 32.3 million recognized in the first quarter of 2023 related to the 7.875 senior secured notes due 2025 (the "2025 Secured Notes"), which included 10.3 million of non-cash interest expense for the write off of the unamortized discount and deferred financing costs and 22.0 million of cash interest expense for the redemption premium, and a reduction in the accretion expense on the settlement payable of 3.2 million, partially offset by an increase in cash interest on our senior secured notes and the ABS Loan Facility of 30.3 million.

 Uniti Leasing Uniti Leasing operating expense increased 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to increases in leased asset costs of 1.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in non-recurring operating expenses of 0.6 million. 
 Uniti Fiber Uniti Fiber operating expenses decreased 3.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which is primarily attributable to decreases in off network expense of 2.5 million and non-recurring installation and equipment expense of 2.1 million, partially offset by an increase in personnel expense of 0.8 million. 
 Goodwill Impairment 
 During the third quarter of 2023, as a result of macroeconomic and financial market factors, specifically, increased interest rates impacting our discount rate, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Uniti Fiber segment, estimated using a combination of the income approach and market approach, was less that its carrying amount. Accordingly, we recorded a 204.0 million 151.9 million net of tax) goodwill impairment in the Uniti Fiber segment during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We recorded no impairment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. See Note 9 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Transaction Related and Other Costs 
 Transaction related and other costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included acquisition, pursuit, transaction and integration costs (including unsuccessful acquisition pursuit costs). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 31.1 million of transaction related and other costs, compared to 9.8 million of such costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase relates primarily to costs associated with the Merger. 
 Other Expense (Income), net 
 
 Other expense (income), net changed 21.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which included 20.6 million of costs related to the issuance of the February 2028 Secured Notes.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We refer to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Funds From Operations FFO (as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT )) and Adjusted Funds From Operations AFFO in our analysis of our results of operations, which are not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ). While we believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure, we also believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and AFFO are important non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT. 
 We define EBITDA as net income, as defined by GAAP, before interest expense, provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before stock-based compensation expense and

 the impact, which may be recurring in nature, of incremental acquisition, pursuit, transaction and integration costs (including unsuccessful acquisition pursuit costs), costs associated with Windstream s bankruptcy, costs associated with litigation claims made against us, and costs associated with the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system, (collectively, Transaction Related and Other Costs ), costs related to the settlement with Windstream, goodwill impairment charges, severance costs, amortization of non-cash rights-of-use assets, the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs, costs incurred as a result of the early repayment of debt, including early tender and redemption premiums and costs associated with the termination of related hedging activities, gains or losses on dispositions, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration and financial instruments, and other similar or infrequent items (although we may not have had such charges in the periods presented). Adjusted EBITDA includes adjustments to reflect the Company s share of Adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated entities. We believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are important supplemental measures to net income because they provide additional information to evaluate our operating performance on an unleveraged basis. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is calculated similar to defined terms in our material debt agreements used to determine compliance with specific financial covenants. Since EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered as alternatives to net income determined in accordance with GAAP. 
 Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires the recognition of depreciation expense except on land, such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. FFO is defined by NAREIT as net income attributable to common shareholders computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and impairment charges, and includes adjustments to reflect the Company s share of FFO from unconsolidated entities. We compute FFO in accordance with NAREIT s definition. 
 The Company defines AFFO, as FFO excluding (i) Transaction Related and Other Costs; (ii) costs related to the litigation settlement with Windstream, accretion on our settlement obligation, and gains on prepayment of our settlement obligation as these items are not reflective of ongoing operating performance; (iii) goodwill impairment charges; (iv) certain non-cash revenues and expenses such as stock-based compensation expense, amortization of debt and equity discounts, amortization of deferred financing costs, depreciation and amortization of non-real estate assets, amortization of non-cash rights-of-use assets, straight line revenues, non-cash income taxes, and the amortization of other non-cash revenues to the extent that cash has not been received, such as revenue associated with the amortization of TCIs; and (v) the impact, which may be recurring in nature, of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, additional costs incurred as a result of the early repayment of debt, including early tender and redemption premiums and costs associated with the termination of related hedging activities, severance costs, taxes associated with tax basis cancellation of debt, gains or losses on dispositions, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration and financial instruments and similar or infrequent items less maintenance capital expenditures. AFFO includes adjustments to reflect the Company s share of AFFO from unconsolidated entities. We believe that the use of FFO and AFFO, and their respective per share amounts, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among investors and analysts, and makes comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. We consider FFO and AFFO to be useful measures for reviewing comparative operating performance. In particular, we believe AFFO, by excluding certain revenue and expense items, can help investors compare our operating performance between periods and to other REITs on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by unanticipated items and events, such as transaction and integration related costs. The Company uses FFO and AFFO, and their respective per share amounts, only as performance measures, and FFO and AFFO do not purport to be indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. While FFO and AFFO are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of REITs, they do not represent cash flows from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance . 
 Further, our computations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to that reported by other REITs or companies that do not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition or define EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO differently than we do .

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal liquidity needs are to fund operating expenses, meet debt service obligations, fund investment activities, including capital expenditures, and to fund the Merger Cash Consideration. Furthermore, following consummation of our settlement agreement with Windstream, including entry into the Windstream Leases, we are obligated (i) to make 490.1 million of cash payments to Windstream in equal installments over 20 consecutive quarters beginning in October 2020 and (ii) to reimburse Windstream for up to an aggregate of 1.75 billion for Growth Capital Improvements in long-term value accretive fiber and related assets made by Windstream through 2029. To date, we have paid 386.9 million of the 490.1 million due to Windstream under the settlement agreement. Uniti s reimbursement commitment for Growth Capital Improvements does not require Uniti to reimburse Windstream for maintenance or repair expenditures (except for costs incurred for fiber replacements to the CLEC MLA leased property, up to 70 million during the term), and each such reimbursement is subject to underwriting standards. Uniti s total annual reimbursement commitments for the Growth Capital Improvements under both Windstream Leases (and under separate equipment loan facilities) were limited to 225 million in 2022 and 2023, and are limited to 225 million per year in 2024; 175 million per year in 2025 and 2026; and 125 million per year in 2027 through 2029. 
 Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash on hand, cash provided by operating activities (primarily from the Windstream Leases), available borrowings under our credit agreement by and among the Operating Partnership, CSL Capital, LLC and Uniti Group Finance 2019 Inc., the guarantors party thereto, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, collateral agent, swing line lender and an L/C issuer and certain other lenders named therein (the

 "Credit Agreement"), and proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities . See Outlook for additional information concerning our near-term and long-term liquidity requirements. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had total cash and cash equivalents of 53.4 million, including 19.3 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents, approximately 495.0 million of borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility maturing on September 24, 2027 under the Credit Agreement (the Revolving Credit Facility ), and up to 75.0 million of borrowing capacity under our ABS Loan Facility, subject to satisfying certain financial metrics and transferring certain additional assets into the facility as collateral, which we expect to occur within twelve months. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, there have been no material outlays of funds outside of our scheduled interest payments. Availability under our Revolving Credit Facility is subject to various conditions, including a maximum secured leverage ratio of 5.0:1. In addition, if we incur debt under our Revolving Credit Facility or otherwise such that our total leverage ratio exceeds 6.5:1, our Revolving Credit Facility would impose significant restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. See Dividends. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (Thousands) 2024 2023 (as restated) Cash flow from operating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities 181,080 190,575 
 Cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributable to our leasing activities, which includes the leasing of mission-critical communications assets to anchor customers on either an exclusive or shared-tenant basis, in addition to the leasing of dark fiber network assets to the telecommunications industry. Cash used in operating activities includes compensation and related costs, interest payments, and other changes in working capital. Net cash provided by operating activities was 181.1 million and 190.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily attributable to an increase in cash interest expense of 2.1 million and cash paid for the interest rate cap of 2.2 million, along with a decrease in distributions from unconsolidated entities of 3.0 million. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (Thousands) 2024 2023 (as restated) Cash flow from investing activities: Capital expenditures (327,762) (368,264) Proceeds from sale of other equipment 528 1,581 Proceeds from sale of real estate 40,039 1,530 Proceeds from sale of unconsolidated entity 40,000 Net cash used in investing activities (247,195) (365,153) 
 Net cash used in investing activities decreased 118.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , primarily driven by proceeds from the sale of our investment in BB Fiber Holdings LLC of 40.0 million, proceeds from the sale of the CableSouth network of 40.0 million, and a decrease in Uniti Fiber and Uniti Leasing capital expenditures of 37.9 million. Capital expenditures are primarily related to our Uniti Fiber and Uniti Leasing businesses for deployment of network assets, as described below under Capital Expenditures.

 Windstream Leases 
 The initial term of the Windstream Leases expires on April 30, 2030. The aggregate initial annual rent under the Windstream Leases is 663.0 million. The Windstream Leases contain cross-guarantees and cross-default provisions, which will remain effective as long as Windstream or an affiliate is the tenant under both of the Windstream Leases and unless and until the landlords under the ILEC MLA are different from the landlords under the CLEC MLA. The Windstream Leases permit Uniti to transfer its rights and obligations and otherwise monetize or encumber the Windstream Leases, together or separately, so long as Uniti does not transfer interests in either Windstream Lease to a Windstream competitor. 
 Beginning in October 2020, pursuant to the Windstream Leases, Windstream (or any successor tenant under a Windstream Lease) has the right to cause Uniti to reimburse up to an aggregate 1.75 billion of Growth Capital Improvements through 2029. Uniti s reimbursement commitment for Growth Capital Improvements does not require Uniti to reimburse Windstream for maintenance or repair expenditures (except for costs incurred for fiber replacements to the CLEC MLA leased property, up to 70 million during the term), and each such reimbursement is subject to underwriting standards. Uniti s total annual reimbursement commitments for the Growth Capital Improvements under both Windstream Leases (and under separate equipment loan facilities) were limited to 225 million in 2022 and 2023, and are limited to 225 million in 2024; 175 million per year in 2025 and 2026; and 125 million per year in 2027 through 2029. If the cost incurred by Windstream (or the successor tenant under a Windstream Lease) for Growth Capital Improvements in any calendar year exceeds the annual limit for such calendar year, Windstream (or such tenant, as the case may be) may submit 
 58 

Table of Contents 

 such excess costs for reimbursement in any subsequent year and such excess costs shall be funded from the annual commitment amounts in such subsequent period. In addition, to the extent that reimbursements for Growth Capital Improvements funded in any calendar year during the term is less than the annual limit for such calendar year, the unfunded amount in any calendar year will carry-over and may be added to the annual limits for subsequent calendar years, subject to an annual limit of 250 million in any calendar year. 
 Starting on the first anniversary of each installment of reimbursement for a Growth Capital Improvement, the rent payable by Windstream under the applicable Windstream Lease will increase by an amount equal to 8.0 (the Rent Rate of such installment of reimbursement. The Rent Rate will thereafter increase to 100.5 of the prior Rent Rate on each anniversary of each reimbursement. In the event that the tenant s interest in either Windstream Lease is transferred by Windstream under the terms thereof (unless transferred to the same transferee), or if Uniti transfers its interests as landlord under either Windstream Lease (unless to the same transferee), the reimbursement rights and obligations will be allocated between the ILEC MLA and the CLEC MLA by Windstream, provided that the maximum that may be allocated to the CLEC MLA following such transfer is 20 million per year. If Uniti fails to reimburse any Growth Capital Improvement reimbursement payment or equipment loan funding request as and when it is required to do so under the terms of the Windstream Leases, and such failure continues for thirty (30) days, then such unreimbursed amounts may be applied as an offset against the rent owed by Windstream under the Windstream Leases (and such amounts will thereafter be treated as if Uniti had reimbursed them). 
 Uniti and Windstream have entered into separate ILEC and CLEC Equipment Loan and Security Agreements (collectively Equipment Loan Agreement in which Uniti will provide up to 125 million (limited to 25 million in any calendar year) of the 1.75 billion of Growth Capital Improvements commitments discussed above in the form of loans for Windstream to purchase equipment related to network upgrades or to be used in connection with the Windstream Leases. Interest on these loans will accrue at 8 from the date of the borrowing. All equipment financed through the Equipment Loan Agreement is the sole property of Windstream; however, Uniti will receive a first-lien security interest in the equipment purchased with the loans. No such loans have been made as of September 30, 2024. 
 UP-REIT Operating Partnership Units 
 Our UP-REIT structure enables us to acquire properties by issuing to sellers, as a form of consideration, limited partnership interests in our operating partnership, (commonly called OP Units ). We believe that this structure will facilitate our ability to acquire individual properties and portfolios of properties by enabling us to structure transactions which will defer taxes payable by a seller while preserving our available cash for other purposes, including the possible payment of dividends. We would expect to eliminate this structure when we complete the Windstream combination. 
 Outlook 
 We anticipate continuing to invest in our network infrastructure across our Uniti Leasing and Uniti Fiber portfolios. We anticipate that we will partially finance these needs, as well as operating expenses (including our debt service obligations), from our cash on hand, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and ABS Loan Facility, and cash flows provided by operating activities. As of September 30, 2024, we had 495.0 million in borrowing availability under our Revolving Credit Facility. Additionally, we have up to 75.0 million in borrowing availability under our ABS Loan Facility, subject to satisfying certain financial metrics and transferring certain additional assets into the facility as collateral, which we expect will occur within twelve months. In addition, we anticipate our cash on hand and borrowing availability under the Revolving Credit Facility and ABS Loan Facility, combined with our cash flows provided by operating activities, will be sufficient to fund our business operations, reimbursement commitments for Growth Capital Improvements and obligations under the settlement agreement with Windstream, and debt service over the next twelve months. However, we may need to access the capital markets to generate additional funds to fund such expenditures. On a longer-term basis, the Company believes the same sources of liquidity and capital will be sufficient to satisfy these liquidity needs and anticipated capital expenditures, which we anticipate will be in line with historic amounts. See Liquidity and Capital Resources and Capital Expenditures for additional information. A significant portion of the Company's indebtedness matures within the next four years, and the Company expects that it will need to refinance or repay its indebtedness at maturity by raising additional capital (which could include a combination of equity offerings and/or debt offerings) or instead seek to extend the applicable maturity dates of its indebtedness. We closely monitor the equity and debt markets and may seek to access them promptly if and when we determine market conditions are appropriate. 
 The amount, nature and timing of any capital markets transactions will depend on: our operating performance and other circumstances; our then-current commitments and obligations; the amount, nature and timing of our capital requirements; any limitations imposed by our current credit arrangements; and overall market conditions. These expectations are forward-

 looking and subject to several uncertainties and assumptions. If our expectations about our liquidity prove to be incorrect or we are unable to access the capital markets as we anticipate, we would be subject to a shortfall in liquidity in the future which could lead to a reduction in our capital expenditures and/or dividends and, in an extreme case, our ability to pay our debt service obligations. If this shortfall occurs rapidly and with little or no notice, it could limit our ability to address the shortfall on a timely basis. 
 In addition to exploring potential capital markets transactions, the Company regularly evaluates market conditions, its liquidity profile, and various financing alternatives for opportunities to enhance its capital structure. If opportunities are favorable, the Company may refinance or repurchase existing debt. However, there can be no assurances that any debt refinancing would be on similar or more favorable terms than our existing arrangements. This would include the risk that interest rates could increase and/or there may be changes to our existing covenants. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 (Thousands) Success Based Maintenance Non-Network Total Capital expenditures Uniti Leasing 13,949 13,949 Growth capital improvements 230,815 230,815 Uniti Fiber 76,611 5,889 469 82,969 Corporate 29 29 Total capital expenditures 321,375 5,889 498 327,762 
 We categorize our capital expenditures as either (i) success-based, (ii) maintenance, or (iii) non-network. We define success-based capital expenditures as those related to installing existing or anticipated contractual customer service orders. Maintenance capital expenditures are those necessary to keep existing network elements fully operational. We anticipate continuing to invest in our network infrastructure across our Uniti Leasing and Uniti Fiber businesses and expect that cash on hand and cash flows provided by operating activities will be sufficient to support these investments. We have the right, but not the obligation (except for Growth Capital Improvements), to reimburse growth capital expenditures in certain of our lease arrangements where we are the lessor. 
 Uniti s total annual reimbursement commitments to Windstream for the Growth Capital Improvements is discussed above in this Part I, Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Liquidity and Capital Resources Windstream Leases. Growth Capital Improvements are treated as success-based capital improvements based on the rents paid with respect to such amounts. 
 If circumstances warrant, we may need to take measures to conserve cash, which may include a suspension, delay or reduction in success-based capital expenditures. 
 
 Dividends 
 We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90 of its REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it annually distributes less than 100 of its taxable income. In order to maintain our REIT status, we intend to make dividend payments of all or substantially all of our taxable income to holders of our common stock out of assets legally available for this purpose, if and to the extent authorized by our board of directors. Before we make any dividend payments, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating requirements and debt service obligations. If our cash available for distribution is less than our taxable income, we could be required to sell assets or borrow funds to make cash dividends or we may make a portion of the required dividend in the form of a taxable distribution of stock or debt securities .

 The following table below sets out details regarding our cash dividends on our common stock: 
 Period Payment Date Cash Dividend Per Share Record Date January 1, 2024 - March 31, 2024 April 12, 2024 0.15 March 28, 2024 April 1, 2024 - June 30, 2024 June 28, 2024 0.15 June 14, 2024 
 Under the Merger Agreement with Windstream, we have agreed to suspend dividend payments or other distributions until the consummation of the Merger, except for the dividend paid on June 28, 2024 and those dividends reasonably required for us or our subsidiaries to maintain its status as a REIT or to avoid the payment or imposition of income or excise tax, among other customary exceptions. Any dividends must be declared by our Board of Directors, which will take into account various factors including our current and anticipated operating results, our financial position, REIT requirements, conditions prevailing in the market, restrictions in our debt documents and additional factors they deem appropriate. Dividend payments are not guaranteed, and our Board of Directors may decide, in its absolute discretion, at any time and for any reason, not to pay dividends or to change the amount paid as dividends. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 We make certain judgments and use certain estimates and assumptions when applying accounting principles in the preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The nature of the estimates and assumptions are material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain factors or the susceptibility of such factors to change. We have identified the accounting for income taxes, revenue recognition, the impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill impairment and business combinations as critical accounting estimates, as they are the most important to our financial statement presentation and require difficult, subjective and complex judgments. 
 We believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and, in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. 
 For further information on our critical accounting estimates, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the notes to our audited financial statements included in our Annual Report. As of September 30, 2024, there has been no material change to these estimates.
