 primary components: paging revenue and product and other revenue. Paging revenue consists primarily of recurring fees associated with the provision of messaging services and fees for paging devices and is net of a provision for service credits. Product and other revenue reflects system sales, sales of paging devices and charges for devices that are not returned and are net of anticipated credits. Our core offering includes subscriptions to one-way or two-way messaging services for a periodic (monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or annual) service fee. This is generally based upon the type of service provided, the geographic area covered, the number of devices provided to the customer and the period of commitment. A subscriber to one-way messaging services may select coverage on a local, regional or nationwide basis to best meet their messaging needs. Two-way messaging is generally offered on a nationwide basis. See Item 1. Business, in the 2023 Annual Report for more details.

primary components: operations revenue and maintenance revenue. Operations revenue consists primarily of license and subscription revenues for our healthcare communications solutions, revenue from the sale of hardware that facilitates the use of our software solutions, and professional services revenue related to the implementation of our solutions. Maintenance revenue is generated from our ongoing support of our software solutions or related hardware and access to when-and-if available software updates. Maintenance is generally purchased and renewed on an annual basis. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. 
 Our software licenses and hardware are generally recognized at a point in time when we have transferred control to the customer. For software licenses, revenue is not recognized until the related license(s) has been made available to the customer and the customer can begin to benefit from its right to use the license(s). Our software licenses represent a right to use Spok s intellectual property ("IP") as it exists at a point in time at which the license is granted. Many of our software licenses have significant standalone functionality due to their ability to process a transaction or perform a function or task, and we do not need to maintain those products, once provided to the customer, for value to exist. While the functionality of the IP that we license may substantively change during the license period, customers are not contractually or practically required to update their license as a result of those changes. 
 Our wireless, professional services, and maintenance are generally recognized over time due to a customer's simultaneous receipt and consumption of the benefit as we perform the work. As we transfer control over time, we recognize revenue based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires significant judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. Generally, we use the time-elapsed measure of progress for performance obligations that include wireless, maintenance or subscription services. We believe this method best depicts the simultaneous transfer and consumption of the benefit based on our performance as these services are generally considered standby services. For professional services, we leverage an input methodology based on the number of hours worked on a project versus the total expected hours necessary to complete the project. Revenues are recognized proportionally as hours are incurred.

Cash dividends on RSUs and restricted stock have been accrued and are paid when the applicable vesting conditions are met.

million of the Company s common stock. Under the repurchase program, repurchases can be made from time to time using a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, all in accordance with the rules of the SEC and other applicable legal requirements. The specific timing, price and size of purchases will depend on prevailing stock prices, general economic and market conditions, legal requirements and other considerations. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at the Company s discretion. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not repurchase any common stock. 
 Net Income per Common Share 
 Basic net income per common share is computed on the basis of the weighted average common shares outstanding. Diluted net income per common share is computed on the basis of the weighted average common shares outstanding plus the effect of all potentially dilutive common shares, including outstanding restricted stock and RSUs, which are treated as contingently issuable shares, using the treasury stock method. 
 Denominator: Basic weighted average common shares outstanding Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding Basic net income per common share Diluted net income per common share 
 
 Stock-Based Compensation Plans 
 On April 10, 2023, our Board of Directors adopted an amendment and restatement of the Spok Holdings, Inc. 2020 Equity Incentive Award Plan (the "2020 Equity Plan") to increase the number of shares available for issuance by shares that our stockholders subsequently approved on July 25, 2023. At July 25, 2023, a total of shares of common stock had been reserved for issuance under the 2020 Equity Plan. 
 Awards under the 2020 Equity Plan may be in the form of stock options, restricted common stock, RSUs, performance awards, dividend equivalents, stock payment awards, deferred stock, DSUs, stock appreciation rights or other stock or cash-based awards. 
 Restricted stock awards generally vest from the date of grant. Related dividends accumulate during the vesting period and are paid at the time of vesting. 
 Contingent RSUs generally vest over a performance period upon successful completion of the performance objectives. Non-contingent RSUs generally vest in thirds, annually, over a period. Dividend equivalent rights generally accompany each RSU award, and those rights accumulate and vest along with the underlying RSU. 
 Dividend equivalent rights generally accompany each DSU award and are paid to participants in cash on the Company's applicable dividend payment date whether the DSU is vested or unvested. The dividend equivalent right associated with a DSU continues until delivery of the underlying shares of common stock is made.

At September 30, 2024, there was million of unrecognized net compensation cost related to RSUs and restricted stock, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years. 
 Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
 In 2016, our Board of Directors adopted the Spok Holdings, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") that our stockholders subsequently approved on July 25, 2016. A total of shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under this plan. 
 The ESPP allows employees to purchase shares of common stock at a discounted rate, subject to plan limitations. Under the ESPP, eligible participants can voluntarily elect to have contributions withheld from their pay for the duration of an offering period, subject to the ESPP limits. At the end of an offering period, contributions will be used to purchase the Company's common stock at a discount to the market price based on the first or last day of the offering period, whichever is lower. 
 Participants are required to hold common stock for a minimum period of from the grant date. Participants will begin earning dividends on shares after the purchase date. Each offering period will generally last for no longer than . Once an offering period begins, participants cannot adjust their withholding amount. If a participant chooses to withdraw, any previously withheld funds will be returned to the participant, with no stock purchased, and that participant will be eligible to participate in the ESPP during the next offering period. If the participant terminates employment with the Company during the offering period, all contributions will be returned to the employee and no stock will be purchased. 
 The Company uses the Black-Scholes model to calculate the fair value of the common stock to be purchased during each offering period on the offer date. The Black-Scholes model requires the use of estimates for the expected term, the expected volatility of the underlying common stock over the expected term, the risk-free interest rate and the expected dividend payment.

 Stock-Based Compensation Expense 
 We record all stock-based compensation, which consist of RSUs, DSUs, restricted stock, equity in lieu of salary, and the option to purchase common stock under the ESPP, at fair value as of the grant date. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized based on a straight-line amortization basis over the respective service period. Forfeitures and withdrawals are accounted for as incurred.

 We assess the recoverability of our deferred income tax assets, which represent the tax benefits of future tax deductions, based on available positive and negative evidence and by considering the adequacy of future taxable income from all sources, including prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. This assessment is required to determine whether, based on all available evidence, it is "more likely than not" (meaning a probability of greater than 50 that all or some portion of the deferred income tax assets will be realized in future periods. During the fourth quarter of each year, we update our multi-year forecast of taxable income for our operations, which assists in analyzing the recoverability of our DTAs.

 Revenue 
 We offer a focused suite of unified clinical communications and collaboration solutions that include call center applications, clinical alerting and notifications, one-way and advanced two-way wireless messaging services, mobile communications and public safety solutions. 
 We develop, sell and support enterprise-wide systems for healthcare, government, large enterprise and other organizations needing to automate, centralize and standardize their approach to clinical communications and collaboration. Our solutions can be found in prominent hospitals, large government agencies, leading public safety institutions, colleges and universities, large hotels, resorts and casinos, and well-known manufacturers. Our primary market is the healthcare provider industry, particularly hospitals. While we have historically identified hospitals with 200 or 
 19 

more beds as the primary targets for our software solutions, as well as our paging services, we have expanded our focus to include smaller hospitals with shorter sales cycles, including academic medical centers. 
 Revenue generated by wireless messaging services (including voice mail, personalized greeting, message storage and retrieval), equipment, maintenance plans and/or equipment loss protection for both one-way and two-way messaging subscribers is presented as wireless revenue in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Revenue generated by the sale of our software solutions, which includes software license, professional services (installation, consulting and training), equipment procured by us from third parties (to be used in conjunction with our software), and post-contract support (ongoing maintenance), is presented as software revenue in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Our software is licensed to end users under an industry standard software license agreement. 
 Refer to Note 5, "Revenue, Deferred Revenue and Prepaid Commissions" in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our wireless and software revenue streams. 
 The table below details revenue for the periods stated:

 Wireless Revenue 
 Wireless revenue is generally reflective of the number of units in service and measured monthly as Average Revenue Per User ("ARPU"). On a consolidated basis, ARPU is affected by several factors, including the mix of units in service and the pricing of the various components of our services. The number of units in service changes based on subscribers added, referred to as gross placements, less subscriber cancellations, or disconnects. 
 Wireless revenue decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, reflective of the secular decrease in our wireless units in service, from 785 thousand as of September 30, 2023 to 730 thousand as of September 30, 2024. This was partially offset by an increase in ARPU, as a result of price increases initiated in September 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, ARPU was 7.95 as compared to 7.59 for the same period in 2023. 
 Wireless revenue decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, reflective of the secular decrease in our wireless units in service, from 785 thousand as of September 30, 2023 to 730 thousand as of September 30, 2024. This was partially offset by an increase in ARPU, as a result of price increases initiated in September 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, ARPU was 7.91 as compared to 7.62 for the same period in 2023. 
 We believe that demand for wireless services will continue to decline for the foreseeable future in line with recent trends, as our wireless products and services are replaced with other competing technologies, such as the shift from narrowband wireless service offerings to broadband technology services. 
 20 

The following reflects the impact of subscribers and ARPU on the change in paging revenue: 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, Change Due To: (in thousands) 2024 2023 Change ARPU Units Paging revenue 17,605 18,119 (514) 795 (1,309) For the Nine Months Ended September 30, Change Due To: (in thousands) 2024 2023 Change ARPU Units Paging revenue 53,208 54,915 (1,707) 1,965 (3,672) 
 As demand for one-way and two-way messaging has declined, we have developed or added service offerings such as encrypted paging and Spok Mobile with a pager number to increase our revenue potential. These service offerings, along with the nominal increases in the standard rate, are designed to mitigate the decline in our wireless revenue. We will continue to explore ways to innovate and provide customers with the highest value possible. 
 In late 2021, we began offering our newest pager, GenA. This one-way alphanumeric pager features a high resolution ePaper display, intuitive modern user interface, advanced encryption and security features, over-the-air remote programming, and an antimicrobial housing. Users can select from various font sizes, and the large GenA display also leverages proportional fonts to maximize key information on a single screen. 
 The GenA pager is the only product available on the market with these capabilities, and we maintain an exclusive arrangement with the product's manufacturer. Given the product differentiation of the GenA pager, its development is a key initiative providing a competitive advantage, and we expect this new technology will be popular with our customers in clinical environments and may help slow our wireless revenue attrition. 
 
 Software Revenue 
 Software revenue consists of two components: operations revenue and maintenance revenue. Operations revenue consists primarily of license and subscription revenues for our healthcare communications solutions, revenue from the sale of hardware that facilitates the use of our software solutions, and professional services revenue related to the implementation of our solutions. Maintenance revenue is generated from our ongoing support of our software solutions or related hardware, typically for a period of one year after project completion. 
 To a large degree, software revenue corresponds to our backlog of performance obligations ready to deliver at some point in the future, and any delays in implementation may affect the timing of revenue recognition. Our software projects generally originate from fixed-bid contracts, although many involve a protracted sales cycle and may result in unforeseen complexity and deviation from the original scope. The time needed to complete projects, therefore, may not align with our original expectations, which affects our backlog. As a result, software revenue may fluctuate on a short-term basis, and we generally evaluate longer-term trends when managing this business. 
 Operations Revenue 
 Software operations revenue increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to increases in professional services revenue, resulting from our targeted hiring efforts over the last 12 months, as we aligned staffing levels with our backlog which had grown as a result of our operations bookings results. This increase was partially offset by decreases in license and hardware revenue, driven by lower sales. 
 Software operations revenue decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease is primarily due to decreases in license and hardware revenue, driven by lower sales. More specifically, results from the second quarter of 2023 included 1.8 million in license revenue from a single customer contract with no similar performance in 2024. These decreases were partially offset by increases in professional services revenue, resulting from our targeted hiring efforts over the last 12 months, as we aligned staffing levels with our backlog, which had grown as a result of our operations bookings results. 
 21 

Maintenance Revenue 
 Maintenance revenue remained flat for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, maintenance revenue increased compared to the same period in 2023, as a result of improvement in our gross revenue churn as well as net new maintenance driven by our operational bookings performance. Given these dynamics, we believe annual maintenance revenue is likely to remain flat or increase marginally, as we continue to enhance our existing software solutions. Further enhancements are expected to provide additional revenues for license sales, which generate new maintenance revenue and help to reduce levels of gross churn. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses are presented in functional categories. Certain of our functional categories are especially important to overall expense control and management. These operating expenses are categorized as follows: 
 Cost of Revenue. These are expenses we incur for the delivery of products and services to our customers and consist primarily of hardware, third-party software, outside services expenses and payroll and related expenses for our professional services, logistics, customer support and maintenance staff. 
 Research and Development. These expenses relate primarily to the development of new software products and the ongoing maintenance and enhancement of existing products. This classification consists primarily of employee payroll and related expenses, outside services related to the design, development, testing and enhancement of our solutions and, to a lesser extent, hardware equipment. Research and development expenses exclude any development costs that qualify for capitalization. 
 Technology Operations. These are expenses associated with the operation of our paging networks. Expenses consist largely of site rent expenses for transmitter locations, telecommunication expenses to deliver messages over our paging networks, and payroll and related expenses for our engineering and pager repair functions. We actively pursue opportunities to consolidate transmitters and other service, rental and maintenance expenses in order to maintain an efficient network while simultaneously ensuring adequate service for our customers. We believe continued reductions in these expenses will occur for the foreseeable future as we continue to consolidate our networks, although the benefits of such network rationalization efforts and resulting costs savings will continue to decline. 
 Selling and Marketing. The sales and marketing staff are involved in selling our communication solutions primarily in the United States. These expenses support our efforts to maintain gross placements of units in service, which mitigated the impact of disconnects on our wireless revenue base, and to identify business opportunities for additional or future software sales. We maintain a centralized marketing function that is focused on supporting our products and vertical sales efforts by strengthening our brand, generating sales leads and facilitating the sales process. These marketing functions are accomplished through targeted email campaigns, webinars, regional and national user conferences, monthly newsletters and participation at industry trade shows. Expenses consist largely of payroll and related expenses, commissions and other costs such as travel and advertising costs. 
 General and Administrative. These are expenses associated with information technology and administrative functions, including finance and accounting, human resources and executive management. This classification consists primarily of payroll and related expenses, outside service expenses, taxes, licenses and permit expenses, and facility rent expenses. 
 Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion. These are expenses that may be associated with one or more of the aforementioned functional categories. This classification generally consists of depreciation from capital expenditures or other assets that are core to our ongoing operations, amortization of intangible assets, amortization of capitalized software development costs, and accretion of asset retirement obligations. 
 22 

The following is a review of our operating expense categories for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation. 
 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of revenue consisted primarily of the following items: 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, Change For the Nine Months Ended September 30, Change (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Total 2024 2023 Total Payroll and related 4,584 3,973 611 15.4 13,861 11,815 2,046 17.3 Cost of sales 1,199 1,381 (182) (13.2) 3,642 4,127 (485) (11.8) Recoverable taxes and fees 1,017 904 113 12.5 2,905 2,780 125 4.5 Stock-based compensation 81 46 35 76.1 241 179 62 34.6 Other 252 318 (66) (20.8) 786 984 (198) (20.1) Total cost of revenue 7,133 6,622 511 7.7 21,435 19,885 1,550 7.8 FTE Employees 155 135 20 14.8 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, cost of revenue increased compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily driven by increases in payroll and related expenses, partially offset by decreases in cost of sales. 
 The increases in payroll and related expenses are primarily due to increases in headcount for added professional services resources in conjunction with our efforts to better align staffing levels with our backlog, as well as increases in employee compensation costs. 
 The decreases in cost of sales are primarily related to lower hardware sales as compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses consisted of the following items: 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, Change For the Nine Months Ended September 30, Change (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Total 2024 2023 Total Payroll and related 1,599 1,571 28 1.8 4,600 4,698 (98) (2.1) Outside services 1,049 985 64 6.5 3,820 3,011 809 26.9 Stock-based compensation 49 (43) 92 (214.0) 147 14 133 950.0 Other 134 48 86 179.2 391 184 207 112.5 Total research and development 2,831 2,561 270 10.5 8,958 7,907 1,051 13.3 FTE Employees 41 38 3 7.9 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses increased, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily driven by an increase in outside services as we continue to invest in the enhancement of our software solutions. 
 23 

Technology Operations 
 Technology operations expenses consisted primarily of the following items: 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, Change For the Nine Months Ended September 30, Change (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Total 2024 2023 Total Payroll and related 2,057 2,247 (190) (8.5) 6,418 6,833 (415) (6.1) Site rent 2,635 2,859 (224) (7.8) 8,162 8,596 (434) (5.0) Telecommunications 687 702 (15) (2.1) 2,066 2,117 (51) (2.4) Stock-based compensation 45 39 6 15.4 134 134 Other 659 558 101 18.1 1,783 1,764 19 1.1 Technology Operations 6,083 6,405 (322) (5.0) 18,563 19,444 (881) (4.5) FTE Employees 66 69 (3) (4.3) 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, technology operations expenses decreased compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to decreases in payroll and related expenses and site rent. 
 The decreases in payroll and related expenses are primarily due to the reduction in headcount as a result of our continuous efforts to optimize costs, partially offset by increases in employee compensation costs. In addition, as a result of our network rationalization efforts, site rent and telecommunications costs decreased in response to a 5.6 decline in active transmitters from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024. As we reach certain minimum frequency commitments, as outlined by the United States Federal Communications Commission, we may be unable to continue our efforts to rationalize and consolidate our networks. 
 
 Selling and Marketing 
 Selling and marketing expenses consisted of the following items: 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, Change For the Nine Months Ended September 30, Change (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Total 2024 2023 Total Payroll and related 2,565 2,509 56 2.2 7,707 7,428 279 3.8 Commissions 899 1,134 (235) (20.7) 2,064 3,429 (1,365) (39.8) Stock-based compensation 135 100 35 35.0 405 286 119 41.6 Advertising and events 251 232 19 8.2 910 734 176 24.0 Other 78 92 (14) (15.2) 496 445 51 11.5 Total selling and marketing 3,928 4,067 (139) (3.4) 11,582 12,322 (740) (6.0) FTE Employees 72 67 5 7.5 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, selling and marketing expenses decreased compared to the same periods in 2023, driven primarily by decreases in commissions and partially offset by increases in payroll and related costs. 
 24 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease in commissions is primarily due to amortization of commissions expense that were previously expensed as incurred under an ASC 606 practical expedient. With the growth in multi-year contracts over the last two years, more related revenue continues to extend beyond the 12-month period allowed for under this practical expedient. As a result, the associated commission expenses are now expensed in alignment with the related revenue, resulting in lower expenses compared to the same periods in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease also includes a one-time benefit from an adjustment to commissions expense that was previously expensed as incurred, as well as lower commissions expense stemming from lower license bookings as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 The increase in payroll and related expenses is due to increases in employee compensation costs. 
 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses consisted of the following items: 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, Change For the Nine Months Ended September 30, Change (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Total 2024 2023 Total Payroll and related 3,403 3,482 (79) (2.3) 10,239 10,303 (64) (0.6) Stock-based compensation 863 723 140 19.4 2,553 2,111 442 20.9 Facility rent, office and technology costs 1,768 1,877 (109) (5.8) 5,171 5,635 (464) (8.2) Outside services 1,269 1,217 52 4.3 3,437 3,512 (75) (2.1) Taxes, licenses and permits 314 241 73 30.3 787 780 7 0.9 Bad debt 52 27 25 92.6 45 (77) 122 (158.4) Other 865 649 216 33.3 2,353 2,141 212 9.9 Total general and administrative 8,534 8,216 318 3.9 24,585 24,405 180 0.7 FTE Employees 72 72 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses increased compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily driven by increases in other and stock-based compensation. These increases were partially offset by decreases in facility rent, office and technology costs. 
 The increases in stock-based compensation are due to increases in employee compensation costs. 
 The decreases in facility rent, office and technology costs were driven by an overall reduction in office space compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 
 Depreciation and Accretion 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, depreciation and accretion expenses were 1.1 million and 1.3 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, depreciation and accretion expenses were 3.2 million and 3.8 million, respectively. These expenses decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to decreases in asset retirement costs. 
 
 Severance and Restructuring 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred severance and restructuring expenses of 0.3 million and 1.1 million, respectively, primarily related to early termination for the lease of our corporate headquarters in Alexandria, Virginia in September 2023 as a result of our continuous efforts to optimize costs. No significant severance and restructuring expenses were incurred for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 25 

Income Taxes 
 Provision for income taxes was 1.5 million and 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Provision for income taxes was 3.8 million and 5.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Provision for income taxes decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to the effect of the anticipated annual effective tax rate change resulting from certain permanent tax differences, estimated research and development tax credits and related valuation allowance, and certain discrete items. Further details can be found in Note 11, "Income Taxes" in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 As of September 30, 2024, we held cash and cash equivalents of 27.8 million. The available cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in our operating accounts and cash invested in interest-bearing funds managed by third-party financial institutions. The Company maintains a majority of its cash and cash equivalents in accounts with major U.S. and multi-national financial institutions, and the majority of our deposits at these institutions exceed insured limits. Market conditions can impact the viability of these institutions. In the event of failure of any of the financial institutions where we maintain our cash and cash equivalents, there can be no assurance that we would be able to access uninsured funds in a timely manner or at all. Any inability to access or delay in accessing these funds could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Cash Sources 
 Our primary sources of liquidity have been our cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents. We maintain a level of liquidity sufficient to allow us to meet our cash needs in both the short term (next 12 months) and long term (beyond 12 months). At any point in time, we maintain approximately 5.0 million to 10.0 million in our operating accounts at third-party financial institutions. While we monitor daily the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate, these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or are subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets. To date, we have experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in our operating accounts. 
 Cash Uses 
 We intend to use our cash on hand to provide working capital, to support operations, to invest in our business, and to return value to stockholders through cash dividends and repurchases of our common stock. We may also consider using cash to fund or complete opportunistic investments and acquisitions that we believe will provide a measure of growth or revenue stability while supporting our existing operations. 
 With the successful completion of the restructuring plan and our ongoing efforts to stabilize revenue and optimize costs, we anticipate positive cash flow generation will continue in future operating periods. In February 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to 10 million of the Company s common stock. This repurchase authority allows us, at management's discretion, to selectively repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market depending upon market price and other factors. 
 Cash Flows Overview 
 In the event that net cash provided by operating activities and cash on hand are not sufficient to meet future cash requirements, we may be required to reduce planned capital expenses, reduce or eliminate our cash dividends to stockholders, not repurchase shares of our common stock under the share repurchase program, sell assets or seek additional financing. We can provide no assurance that reductions in planned capital expenses or proceeds from asset sales would be sufficient to cover shortfalls in available cash or that outside financing would be available on acceptable terms. 
 Based on current and anticipated levels of operations, we anticipate that net cash provided by operating activities, together with the available cash on hand at September 30, 2024, should be adequate to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the short term (next 12 months) and long term (beyond 12 months). 
 26 

The following table sets forth information on our net cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the periods stated: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 
 Change (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 20,515 14,396 6,119 Net cash used in investing activities (2,348) (2,419) 71 Net cash used in financing activities (22,343) (20,559) (1,784) 
 Operating Activities 
 As discussed above, we are dependent on cash flows from operating activities to meet our cash requirements. Cash from operations varies depending on changes in various working capital items, including deferred revenues, accounts payable, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and various accrued expenses. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 20.5 million, an increase of 6.1 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net cash provided by operating activities primarily consisted of net income of 11.3 million, accounts receivable of 1.5 million, deferred revenue of 2.3 million, and non-cash items such as depreciation and accretion of 3.2 million, deferred income tax expense of 3.6 million and stock-based compensation of 3.5 million, partially offset by accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other of 4.3 million and prepaid expenses and other assets of 1.1 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was 14.4 million, primarily driven by net income of 12.3 million, accounts receivable of 1.3 million and non-cash items such as depreciation and accretion of 3.8 million, deferred income tax expense of 5.6 million and stock-based compensation of 2.7 million. These increases were partially offset by accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other of 7.4 million, deferred revenue of 2.0 million, net operating lease liabilities of 1.2 million and prepaid expenses and other assets of 1.1 million. 
 Investing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, net cash used in investing activities was 2.3 million and 2.4 million, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities reflects purchases of property and equipment. 
 Financing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, net cash used in financing activities was 22.3 million and 20.6 million, respectively, primarily due to cash distributions to stockholders and the purchase of common stock for tax withholding purposes on vested equity awards. 
 On October 30, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 0.3125 per share of common stock with a record date of November 18, 2024, and a payment date of December 9, 2024. This cash dividend of approximately 6.3 million, applicable to our common stock outstanding, will be paid from available cash on hand. 
 
 Commitments and Contingencies 
 In the ordinary course of our operations, we enter into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include data processing services, operating leases for premises and equipment, agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities. 
 Purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, legally binding, non-cancelable, have a remaining term in excess of one year and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable pricing provisions; and the approximate timing of transactions. The amounts of such obligations are based on our contractual commitments; however, it is possible that we may be able to negotiate lower payments if we choose to exit these contracts before their expiration date. 
 Our contractual payment obligations for operating leases apply to leases for office space and transmitter locations. Substantially all of these leases have lease terms ranging from one month to five years. We continue to review our office and transmitter locations and intend to replace, reduce or consolidate leases where possible. As we reach certain minimum frequency commitments, as outlined by the United States Federal Communications Commission, we may be unable to continue our efforts to rationalize and consolidate our networks. 
 27 

We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. 
 The Company evaluates contingencies on an ongoing basis and establishes loss provisions for matters in which losses are probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. 
 The following table provides the Company's significant commitments and contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024: 
 Payments Due by Period (Dollars in thousands) Total 1 year or less

 Related Party Transactions 
 See Note 13, "Related Parties" in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion regarding our related party transactions. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The preceding discussion and analysis of financial condition and operations is based on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). The preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to, those related to the impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill, accounts receivable, revenue recognition, depreciation expense, asset retirement obligations, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 
 There have been no changes to the critical accounting policies reported in the 2023 Annual Report that affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding debt and no revolving credit facility. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 We conduct a limited amount of business outside the United States. The financial impact of transactions billed in foreign currencies is immaterial to our financial results and, consequently, we do not have any material exposure to the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations .

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management carried out an evaluation, as required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of our last fiscal quarter. Disclosure controls and procedures are defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act as controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes made to the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
