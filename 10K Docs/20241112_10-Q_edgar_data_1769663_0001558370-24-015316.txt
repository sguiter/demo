The Company analyzes commercial loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: Special Mention Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position at some future date. Substandard Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.

 Standby letters of credit 

June 30, 2024 Fixed Rate Variable Rate Total Financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk (including unused lines of credit and unadvanced loan funds): Commitments to extend credit Standby letters of credit Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and require payment of a fee. Since certain commitments are expected to expire without being fully drawn, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer s credit-worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral, if any, required by the Company for the extension of credit is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer. Commitments to extend credit may be written on a fixed rate basis thus exposing the Company to interest rate risk, given the possibility that market rates may change between commitment and actual extension of credit. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee payment on behalf of a customer or to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing these instruments is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers. Since a portion of these instruments will expire unused, the total amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Each customer is evaluated individually for creditworthiness under the same underwriting standards used for commitments to extend credit and on-balance-sheet instruments. Bank policies governing loan collateral apply to standby letters of credit at the time of credit extension. Certain residential mortgage loans are written on an adjustable basis and include interest rate caps which limit annual and lifetime increases in interest rates. Generally, adjustable rate mortgages have an annual rate increase cap of to and lifetime rate increase cap of to above the initial loan rate. These caps expose the Company to interest rate risk should market rates increase above these limits. At September 30, 2024, approximately million of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans had interest rate caps. In addition, certain adjustable rate residential mortgage

 of the adjustable rate mortgage loans had conversion options. The Company periodically sells residential mortgage loans to the Federal National Mortgage Association FNMA ). At September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the Bank had loans held for sale. In addition, the Bank had loan commitments with borrowers at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 with rate lock agreements which are intended to be held for sale, if closed. The Company generally determines whether or not a loan is held for sale at the time that loan commitments are entered into or at the time a convertible adjustable-rate mortgage loan converts to a fixed interest rate. In order to reduce the interest rate risk associated with the portfolio of loans held for sale, as well as loan commitments with locked interest rates which are intended to be held for sale if closed, the Company enters into agreements to sell loans in the secondary market. At September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the Company had commitments to sell loans to unrelated investors. Concentrations of Credit The Company primarily grants loans to customers located in the New York State counties of Albany, Greene, Rensselaer, Schenectady, Saratoga, and Warren. Although the Company has a diversified loan portfolio, a substantial portion of its debtors ability to honor their contracts is dependent upon the real estate and construction-related sectors of the economy, and general economic conditions in the Company s market area. Legal Proceedings and Other Contingent Liabilities In the ordinary course of business, the Company and the Bank are involved in a number of legal, regulatory, governmental and other proceedings, claims or investigations that could result in losses, including damages, fines and/or civil penalties, which could be significant concerning matters arising from the conduct of their business, including the matters described below. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly where the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages, the Company generally cannot predict the eventual outcome of the pending matters, timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters, or eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending matter. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company will establish an accrued liability when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable. The Company s estimates of potential losses will change over time and the actual losses may vary significantly, and there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. As a matter develops, management, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, evaluate on an ongoing basis whether such matter presents a loss contingency that is probable and estimable; or where a loss is reasonably possible, whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, whether it is possible to estimate a range of possible loss. Once the loss contingency is deemed to be both probable and estimable, the Company establishes an accrued liability and records a corresponding amount of litigation-related expense. The Company continues to monitor the matters for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established. Excluding legal fees and expenses, litigation-related expense of was recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. For those matters for which a loss is reasonably possible and estimable, whether in excess of an accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, the Company s estimated range of possible loss is to million in excess of the accrued liability, if any, as of September 30, 2024. These estimates are based upon currently available information and are subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the accrued liability and estimated range of possible losses are unpredictable and may change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly from the current estimate and accrual. The estimated range of possible loss does not represent the Company s maximum loss exposure. Information is provided below regarding the nature of the matters and associated claimed damages. The Company and the Bank are defending each of these matters vigorously, and the Company believes that it and the Bank have substantial defenses, including affirmative defenses, counterclaims and cross-claims to the various allegations that have been asserted. In light of the significant judgment, variety of assumptions and uncertainties involved in the matters described below, some of which are beyond the Company s control, and the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters, or matters related to or resulting from the matters described below, could have an adverse material impact on the Company s business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or cause significant reputational harm and subject the Company to face civil litigation, significant fines, damage awards or other material regulatory consequences.

 million. In the first fiscal quarter of 2020, the Bank exercised its rights pursuant to state and federal law and the relevant Mann Entity general deposit account agreements to take actions to set off/recover approximately million from general deposit corporate operating accounts held by the Mann Entities at the Bank to partially cover overdrafts/negative account balances in Mann Entity general deposit corporate operating accounts that primarily resulted from another bank returning/calling back million in checks on August 30, 2019, that the Mann Entities had deposited into and then withdrawn from their accounts at the Bank the day before. In the first fiscal quarter of 2020, the Bank recognized a charge to non-interest expense in the amount of million based on the net negative deposit balance of the various Mann Entities accounts after the setoffs/overdraft recoveries. Through September 30, 2024, additional charges to non-interest expense were recognized related to the deposit transactions with the Mann Entities. With respect to the Bank s lending activity with the Mann Entities, its potential exposure was approximately million (which represents the Bank s participation interest in the approximately million commercial loan relationships for which the Bank is the originating lender). In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2019, the Bank recognized a provision for loan losses in the amount of million, related to the charge-off of the entire principal balance owed to the Bank related to the Mann Entities commercial loan relationships. During the third fiscal quarter of 2020 and the first fiscal quarter of 2021, the Bank recognized partial recoveries in the amount of million and , respectively, related to the charge-off of the Mann Entities commercial loan relationships, which were credited to the allowance for loan losses. Through September 30, 2024, additional charges to the provision for credit losses and additional recoveries related to the charge-off of the loans were recognized related to the loan transactions with the Mann Entities. Several other parties and regulatory agencies have asserted claims against the Company and the Bank related to the series of transactions between the Company or the Bank, on the one hand, and the Mann Entities, on the other. The Company and the Bank continue to investigate these matters and it is possible that the Company and the Bank will be subject to similar legal, regulatory, governmental or other proceedings and additional liabilities. The ultimate timing and outcome of any such proceedings, involving the Company, or the Bank, cannot be predicted with any certainty. It also remains possible that other private parties or governmental bodies will pursue existing or additional claims against the Bank as a result of the Bank s dealings with certain of the Mann Entities or as a result of the actions taken by the Company or the Bank. The Company s and the Bank s legal fees and expenses related to these actions are significant and are expected to continue being significant. In addition, costs associated with potentially prosecuting, litigating or settling any litigation, satisfying any adverse judgments, if any, or other proceedings, could be significant. These legal, regulatory, governmental and other proceedings, claims or investigations, costs, settlements, judgments, sanctions or other expenses could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business prospects, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows or cause significant reputational harm and subject the Company to face civil litigation, significant fines, damage awards or other material regulatory consequences. The Company is pursuing all available sources of recovery and other means of mitigating the potential loss, and the Company and the Bank are vigorously defending all claims asserted against them arising out of or otherwise related to the fraudulent activity of the Mann Entities. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Bank recognized insurance recoveries in the amount of and , respectively, related to the partial reimbursement of defense costs incurred as a result of these matters, which were credited to noninterest expense professional fees on the consolidated statements of operations. While the Bank has been reimbursed in the past by its insurer for certain legal fees and expenses associated with this matter, the Bank does not expect to recognize any such insurance recoveries in the future, as the applicable policy limits and deductibles have been exceeded. For a fuller recitation of the procedural history of each of the matters summarized below, please refer to the Company s earlier periodic filings on Forms 10-Q and 10-K. The Pioneer Parties (as defined below) vigorously dispute the assertions and claims in each of the matters noted below.

 million from Cachet in August 2019 by manipulating Cachet s batch file specifications, and that Mann subsequently caused approximately million of those purportedly stolen funds to be deposited into accounts held by companies owned by Mann at Pioneer Bank. Cachet alleges Pioneer Bank refused Cachet s request to return the approximately million in purportedly stolen funds to Cachet. Cachet s complaint asserts causes of action against the Pioneer Parties for avoidance and recovery of constructive fraudulent transfers, conversion, unjust enrichment, money had and received, violation of California Penal Code 496(a), violations of RICO, aiding and abetting fraud, and declaratory relief. Cachet asserts actual damages of approximately million, seeks three times its actual damages on its Section 496(a) claim (or approximately million), and costs of suit and attorneys fees. Cachet also seeks treble damages according to proof and attorneys fees, and for its aiding abetting fraud claim, Cachet seeks general, consequential and special damages in an amount to be proven at trial. On April 28, 2023, the Pioneer Parties filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On September 6, 2023, the Court entered an order granting in part and denying in part the Pioneer Parties motion. In particular, the Court dismissed Cachet s claims for violations of RICO, violation of California Penal Code 496(a), aiding and abetting fraud and conversion, and for declaratory relief. The Court denied the Pioneer Parties motion as to the claims for conversion, unjust enrichment, and money had and received. The Court permitted Cachet to file a second amended complaint. On September 20, 2023, Cachet filed a motion for reconsideration of the Court s Order. The Pioneer Parties filed their opposition on October 26, 2023, and Cachet filed its reply on November 2, 2023.

The complaint alleges, among other things, that the Pioneer Parties wrongfully set off approximately million from an account held by Cloud Payroll to apply towards debts allegedly owed to the Bank by Cloud Payroll and other affiliates of Michael Mann. The complaint alleges that the funds in question were comprised of payroll taxes and thus subject to a statutory trust under 26 U.S.C. 7501 that prohibited the Bank from setting off those funds to apply towards debts owed to the Bank. The complaint seeks return of any payroll taxes, plus interest. On October 21, 2020, the DOJ filed an amended complaint that dropped one of the DOJ s claims against the Pioneer Parties but continues to seek return of any payroll taxes, plus interest. The amended complaint relates to the same set of facts described above in Mann Entities Related Fraudulent Activity , and the alleged payroll taxes, plus interest, sought in this proceeding may be part of the recovery sought in the Southwestern and NatPay complaints described above. On November 4, 2020, the Pioneer Parties filed their answer and affirmative defenses to the DOJ s amended complaint.

On August 31, 2020, AXH Air-Coolers, LLC AXH filed a complaint against the Pioneer Parties, and unnamed employees of the Pioneer Parties in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York.

Scisci and Mr. Vincent Commisso (collectively, with TBC, the TBC Parties ), alleging professional malpractice by the TBC Parties in auditing the annual consolidated financial statements of Valuewise Corporation and its subsidiaries Valuewise Entities for the fiscal years 2010 to 2018. The Bank asserts that the TBC Parties were aware that the primary, if not the exclusive, reason the Valuewise Entities engaged TBC to audit their financial statements was to provide the Bank with accurate financial information that the Bank would rely on in evaluating whether to provide loans to the Valuewise Entities. The Bank contends that, among other matters, Mr. Michael Mann used the Valuewise Entities to defraud the Bank because of the professional malpractice of the TBC Parties and that if the TBC Parties had not committed professional malpractice by issuing unqualified clean opinions on the financial statements of the Valuewise Entities for fiscal years 2010 to 2018, the Bank would never have continued loaning money to the Valuewise Entities. The Bank seeks to recover damages of at least million (plus interest)

The first complaint was filed by Brandes Yancy PLLC and Ricardo s Restaurant, Inc., two alleged clients of Southwestern which seek to assert claims on behalf of all current or former Southwestern clients based on the same set of facts as the DOJ, AXH, and Granite Solutions complaints as described above, and the alleged taxes sought in the DOJ, Southwestern, and NatPay complaints. The second complaint was filed by O Malley s Oven LLC and Legat Architects, Inc., two alleged clients of MyPayrollHR.Com, LLC and ProData Payroll Services, Inc., affiliates of Cloud Payroll, LLC (collectively, Cloud Payroll ). Similar to the first complaint described above, the two named plaintiffs in the second complaint seek to assert claims on behalf of all current or former Cloud Payroll clients based on the same set of facts as the DOJ, AXH, and Granite Solutions complaints as described above, and the alleged taxes sought in the DOJ, Southwestern, and NatPay complaints.

On December 6, 2023, Sidra Riggins filed a putative class action complaint against the Bank in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York. The plaintiff is an alleged customer of the Bank who asserts claims for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, violation of New York General Business Law 349, and violation of the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, 15 U.S.C. 1693 et seq. The plaintiff s claims concern alleged practices of the Bank relating to fees that the Bank allegedly assessed in connection with certain types of overdrafts or transaction items returned for insufficient funds. The plaintiff seeks to assert her claims on behalf of the following individuals: (i) New York citizens who held checking accounts at the Bank and were assessed an overdraft fee on a debit card transaction that was authorized on sufficient funds and settled on negative funds in the same amount for which the debit card transaction was authorized; (ii) New York citizens who are assessed multiple fees on a transaction item in a checking account held at the Bank; and

Overview Net Interest Income. Our primary source of income is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income, which is the income we earn on our loans and investments, and interest expense, which is the interest we pay on our deposits and borrowings. Provision for Credit Losses. We charge (credit) provisions for credit losses to operations in order to maintain our allowance for credit losses on loans, securities held to maturity and unfunded commitments at a level that is considered reasonable and necessary to absorb expected credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and securities held to maturity portfolio, as well as expected losses on commitments to grant loans that are expected to be advanced at the statements of condition date. Loans are charged against the allowance when management believes that the collectability of the principal loan amount is not probable. Recoveries on loans previously charged-off, if any, are credited to the allowance for credit losses when realized.

 Non-interest Income. Our primary sources of non-interest income are banking fees and service charges, and insurance and wealth management services income. Our non-interest income also includes net gain or losses on equity securities, net gain or losses on sales and calls of available for sale securities, and miscellaneous income. Non-Interest Expense. Our non-interest expenses consist of salaries and employee benefits, net occupancy and equipment, data processing, advertising and marketing, insurance premiums, federal deposit insurance premiums, professional fees, and other general and administrative expenses. Salaries and employee benefits consist primarily of salaries and wages paid to our employees, payroll taxes, and expenses for worker s compensation and disability insurance, health insurance, retirement plans and other employee benefits, as well as commissions and other incentives. Net occupancy and equipment expenses, which are the fixed and variable costs of buildings and equipment, consist primarily of depreciation charges, rental expenses, furniture and equipment expenses, maintenance, real estate taxes and costs of utilities. Depreciation of premises and equipment is computed using a straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the related assets or the expected lease terms, if shorter. Data processing expenses are fees we pay to third parties for use of their software and for processing customer information, deposits and loans. Advertising and marketing includes most marketing expenses including multi-media advertising (public and in-store), promotional events and materials, civic and sales focused memberships, and community support. Insurance premiums include expense related to various insurance policies, excluding federal deposit insurance premiums. Federal deposit insurance premiums are payments we make to the FDIC for insurance of our deposit accounts. Professional fees include legal and other consulting expenses. Other general and administrative expenses include expenses for office supplies, postage, telephone, insurance and other miscellaneous operating expenses. Income Tax Expense. Our income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.

 Recent Developments Change in Fiscal Year End On October 15, 2024, the board of directors of the Company approved an amendment to Article VI, Section 5 of its Bylaws to change its fiscal year from June 30 to December 31. As a result of this change the three months ended September 30, 2024 is the first three months of the Company s six month transition period ending December 31, 2024. The Company will file a transition report for the six months ending December 31, 2024 on Form 10-K. Completion of Pioneer Commercial Bank Merger On September 16, 2024, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the OCC approved the merger of Pioneer Commercial Bank with and into Pioneer Bank with Pioneer Bank as the resulting entity (the Commercial Bank Merger ). The Commercial Bank Merger closed on October 1, 2024. Following the completion of the Commercial Bank Merger, Pioneer Bank now directly offers full municipal deposit banking services which were previously provided through Pioneer Commercial Bank. Mann Entities Related Fraudulent Activity During the first fiscal quarter of 2020 (the quarter ended September 30, 2019), the Company became aware of potentially fraudulent activity associated with transactions by an established business customer of the Bank. The customer and various affiliated entities (collectively, the Mann Entities had numerous accounts with the Bank. The transactions in question related both to deposit and lending activity with the Mann Entities. For additional details regarding legal, other proceedings and related matters see Item 1 Consolidated Financial Statements Note 9 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities Legal Proceedings and Other Contingent Liabilities. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. We consider the accounting policies and estimates discussed below to be critical accounting policies and estimates. The estimates and assumptions that we use are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations. The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As an emerging growth company we may delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We intend to continue to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. The following represent our critical accounting policies and estimates: Allowance for Credit Losses. The allowance for credit losses consists of the allowance for credit losses on loans, securities held to maturity and unfunded commitments. The measurement of Current Expected Credit Losses CECL on financial instruments requires an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of an exposure (or pool of exposures). The estimate of expected credit losses under the CECL approach is based on relevant information about past events, current conditions, macroeconomic variables (e.g., civilian unemployment and U.S. gross domestic product GDP )), and reasonable and supportable forecasts from the Federal Open Market Committee FOMC that affect the collectability of the reported amounts. Historical loss experience is generally the starting point for estimating expected 

 40 

Table of Contents 
 credit losses. The Company then considers whether the historical loss experience should be adjusted for asset-specific risk characteristics or current conditions at the reporting date that did not exist over the period from which historical experience was used. Finally, the Company considers forecasts about future economic conditions that are reasonable and supportable. On a case-by-case basis, the Company may conclude that a loan should be evaluated on an individual basis based on its disparate risk characteristics. When the Company determines that a loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with other loans in the portfolio, the allowance will be determined on an individual basis using the present value of expected cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the estimated fair value of the collateral, as applicable. The allowance for credit losses on loans and securities held to maturity, as reported in our consolidated statements of condition, are adjusted by a provision for credit losses, which is recognized in earnings, and reduced by the charge-offs, net of recoveries. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments represents the expected credit losses on off-balance sheet commitments such as unfunded commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. However, a liability is not recognized for commitments unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments is determined by estimating future draws and applying the expected loss rates on those draws and is included in other liabilities on the Company s consolidated statements of condition. As a substantial percentage of our loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate, appraisals of the underlying value of property securing loans are critical in determining the amount of the allowance required for specific loans. Assumptions are instrumental in determining the value of properties. Overly optimistic assumptions or negative changes to assumptions could significantly affect the valuation of a property securing a loan and the related allowance determined. Management carefully reviews the assumptions supporting such appraisals to determine that the resulting values reasonably reflect amounts realizable on the related loans. Management of the Company considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for credit losses to be a critical accounting estimate given the uncertainty in evaluating the level of the allowance required to cover management s estimate of all expected credit losses over the expected contractual life of our loan portfolios. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, including making significant estimates of current credit risks and trends using existing quantitative and qualitative information, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, which may undergo frequent and material changes. Subsequent evaluations of the then-existing loan portfolios, in light of changes in economic conditions, new information regarding existing loans and other factors, may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in those future periods. For example, changes to the FOMC s forecasted civilian unemployment rate and year-over-year U.S. GDP growth could have a material impact on the model s estimation of the allowance for credit losses on loans. An immediate increase of 100 basis points in the FOMC s projected rate of civilian unemployment and a decrease of 100 basis points in the FOMC s projected rate of U.S. GDP growth would increase the model s total calculated allowance for credit losses on loans by 1.2 million, or 5.6 , assuming qualitative adjustments are kept at current levels. While management s current evaluation of the allowance for credit losses indicates that the allowance is appropriate, the allowance may need to be increased under adversely different conditions or assumptions. Additionally, changes in those factors and inputs may not occur at the same rate and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvements in one factor may offset deterioration in in others. Going forward, the impact of utilizing the CECL approach to calculate the allowance for credit losses will be significantly influenced by the composition, characteristics and quality of our loan portfolios, as well as the prevailing economic conditions and forecasts utilized. Material changes to these and other relevant factors may result in greater volatility to the allowance for credit losses, and therefore, greater volatility to our reported earnings. Actual loan losses may be significantly more than the allowance we have established which could have a material negative effect on our financial results. Legal Proceedings and Other Contingent Liabilities. In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in a number of legal, regulatory, governmental and other proceedings, claims or investigations that could result in losses, including damages, fines and/or civil penalties, which could be significant concerning matters arising from the conduct of our business. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly where the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages, we generally cannot predict the eventual outcome of the pending matters, timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters, or eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending matter. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, we establish an accrued liability when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable. Our estimate of potential losses will change over time and the actual losses may exceed 

 41 

Table of Contents 
 these estimates, and there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. As a matter develops, management, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, evaluate on an ongoing basis whether such matter presents a loss contingency that is probable and estimable; or where a loss is reasonably possible, whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, whether it is possible to estimate a range of possible loss. Once the loss contingency is deemed to be both probable and estimable, we establish an accrued liability and record a corresponding amount of litigation-related expense. We continue to monitor the matters for further developments, including our interactions with various regulatory agencies with supervisory authority over us, that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established. These estimates are based upon currently available information and are subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the accrued liability and estimated range of possible losses are unpredictable and may change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly from the current estimate and accrual which could have a material negative effect on our financial results. The estimated range of possible loss does not represent our maximum loss exposure.

Total assets of 2.01 billion at September 30, 2024 increased 119.2 million, or 6.3 , from 1.90 billion at June 30, 2024. The increase was due primarily to an increase of 55.7 million, or 4.1 , in net loans receivable, an increase of 59.8 million, or 36.2 in cash and cash equivalents, and an increase of 5.1 million, or 2.0 in securities available for sale. Cash and Cash Equivalents. Total cash and cash equivalents of 225.0 million at September 30, 2024, increased 59.8 million, or 36.2 , from 165.2 million at June 30, 2024. Securities Available for Sale. Total securities available for sale of 262.5 million at September 30, 2024 increased 5.1 million, or 2.0 , from 257.4 million at June 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to purchases of 37.2 million, offset in part by maturities, paydowns, calls and sales of 35.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Net Loans Receivable. Net loans receivable of 1.40 billion at September 30, 2024 increased 55.7 million, or 4.1 , from 1.34 billion at June 30, 2024. By loan category, residential mortgage loans increased by 31.2 million, or 4.9 , to 665.0 million at September 30, 2024 from 633.8 million at June 30, 2024, commercial real estate loans increased by 15.2 million, or 3.7 , to 421.4 million at September 30, 2024 from 406.2 million at June 30, 2024, commercial and industrial loans increased by 8.2 million, or 8.1 , to 109.4 million at September 30, 2024 from 101.2 million at June 30, 2024, consumer loans increased by 4.6 million, or 33.7 , to 18.1 million at September 30, 2024 from 13.5 million at June 30, 2024, and home equity loans and lines of credit increased by 1.0 million, or 1.2 , to 93.8 million at September 30, 2024 from 92.8 million at June 30, 2024. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in commercial construction loans of 5.1 million, or 4.3 , to 113.3 million at September 30, 2024 from 118.4 million at June 30, 2024. The increase in residential mortgage loans was primarily related to the Bank s relationship with a third-party mortgage banking company which facilitated an increase in residential mortgage loan volume, despite the higher interest rate environment. The increase in commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans was due to loan funding 

 44 

Table of Contents 
 outpacing loan payoffs. The increase in consumer loans was due to the purchase of 5.0 million in unsecured consumer loans during the quarter. The decrease in commercial construction loans was related to the conversion of loans to permanent financing. The following table presents our commercial real estate loan portfolio by industry sector at September 30, 2024.

Deposits. Total deposits of 1.68 billion at September 30, 2024 increased 125.0 million, or 8.1 , from 1.55 billion at June 30, 2024. By deposit category, non-interest-bearing demand deposits increased by 92.6 million, or 20.8 , to 537.9 million at September 30, 2024 from 445.3 million at June 30, 2024, money market accounts increased by 37.6 million, or 7.3 , to 551.3 million at September 30, 2024 from 513.7 million at June 30, 2024, and demand accounts increased by 12.0 million, or 7.6 , to 170.0 million at September 30, 2024 from 158.0 million at June 30, 2024. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in certificates of deposit by 10.6 million, or 6.4 , to 156.4 million at September 30, 2024 from 167.0 million at June 30, 2024 (included in certificates of deposit were brokered deposits which decreased by 19.5 million to 19.8 million at September 30, 2024 from 39.3 million at June 30, 2024) and a decrease in savings accounts by 6.6 million, or 2.5 , to 259.7 million at September 30, 2024 from 266.3 million at June 30, 2024. The increase in non-interest-bearing demand accounts and demand accounts was primarily related to growth in municipal deposits due to seasonality. The increase in money market accounts was primarily due to growth in municipal and commercial deposits and migration of funds from non-interest-bearing demand, savings and other lower rate interest-bearing accounts. The decrease in certificates of deposit was primarily due to a decrease in brokered deposits, partially offset by a migration of funds from non-interest-bearing demand, savings and other lower rate interest-bearing accounts. The decrease in savings accounts was primarily related to migration of funds to higher interest-bearing accounts.

The Company calculates its uninsured deposit balances based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for regulatory reporting requirements, which includes collateralized deposits. The following table estimates uninsured deposits after certain exclusions: 

September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 Uninsured deposits, per regulatory requirements 844,588 695,526 Less: Affiliate deposits 44,131 44,699 Collateralized deposits 551,659 423,470 Uninsured deposits, after exclusions 248,798 227,357 Uninsured deposits after exclusions represents 14.9 and 14.7 of total deposits as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. The Company believes that this presentation of uninsured deposits provides a more accurate view of deposits at risk as affiliate deposits are not customer facing and therefore are eliminated upon consolidation, and collateralized deposits are fully secured by investments and municipal letters of credits. Total Shareholders Equity. Total shareholders equity of 303.8 million at September 30, 2024 increased 7.3 million, or 2.5 , from 296.5 million at June 30, 2024 primarily as a result of net income of 6.3 million and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of 1.7 million, partially offset by the repurchase of common stock of 1.2 million. Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 General. Net income increased by 2.9 million to 6.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net interest income of 2.0 million, a decrease in the provision for credit losses of 1.6 million, and an increase in non-interest income of 544,000, offset in part by an increase in income tax expense of 998,000 and an increase in non-interest expense of 284,000. Interest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income increased 4.2 million, or 21.0 , to 24.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 20.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to increases in interest income on loans and interest-earning deposits with banks and other, offset in part by a decrease in interest income on securities. The increase was the result of an 85 basis points increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets to 5.64 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 4.79 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets was driven by an increase in variable rate loan yields, as well as due to market related increases in interest rates on new loans and an asset allocation shift, using investment securities cash flow to fund higher yielding assets. Average interest-earning assets increased by 52.6 million from 1.70 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.75 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to the increase in the average balance of loans. Interest income on loans increased 4.4 million, or 26.6 , to 20.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 16.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income on loans increased due to a 203.8 million increase in the average balance of loans to 1.38 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.18 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023, coupled with a 46 basis points increase in the average

Table of Contents 
 yield on loans to 6.16 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.70 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the average balance of loans was principally due to purchases of residential mortgage loans. The increase in average yield on loans was primarily due to loans tied to variable short-term rates and market related increases in interest rates on new loans as compared to the same period in the prior year. Interest income on securities decreased 403,000, or 15.7 , to 2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income on securities decreased due to a 165.4 million decrease in the average balance of securities to 280.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 446.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, offset in part by a 79 basis points increase in the average yield on securities to 3.09 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.30 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the average balance of securities was primarily due to the sales of U.S. government and agency securities during the three months ended December 31, 2023 as part of a balance sheet repositioning in which the Company sold 74.5 million of lower-yielding available for sale securities with an average book yield of approximately 0.83 , and maturities of U.S. government and agency and municipal obligation securities, in conjunction with an asset allocation shift, using investment securities cash flow to fund higher yielding assets. The increase in average yield on securities was due to higher market rates of interest for new securities that were purchased replacing lower yielding available for sale securities. Interest income on interest-earning deposits with banks and other increased 229,000 to 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income on interest-earning deposits with banks and other increased due to a 14.1 million increase in the average balances on interest-earning deposits with banks and other to 90.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 76.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a net increase in deposits, as well as a 16 basis points increase in the average yield on interest-earning deposits with banks and other to 5.74 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.58 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the purchase of Federal Reserve Bank of New York stock during the three months ended June 30, 2024. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased 2.2 million to 6.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of increases in interest expense on deposits. The increase was primarily due to a 69 basis points increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities to 2.35 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.66 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as well as a shift in the mix of interest-bearing liabilities to higher interest rate liability accounts. Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits increased 2.3 million to 6.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits increased primarily due to a 74 basis points increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits to 2.32 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.58 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as well as a shift in the mix of interest-bearing deposits to higher interest rate deposit accounts and an increase in average interest-bearing deposits of 83.2 million to 1.08 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.00 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits was primarily due to the repricing of certain interest-bearing deposit accounts in response to changes in market interest rates and the higher interest rate environment, as well as a shift in the mix of deposits towards higher cost interest-bearing accounts. The increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits was due to higher average money market and certificates of deposit balances. Interest expense on borrowings and other liabilities decreased 100,000 to 212,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 312,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to the decrease in the average borrowings and other liabilities of 4.5 million to 23.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 27.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and by a decrease in the average cost of borrowings and other liabilities of 87 basis points to 3.64 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.51 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net Interest Income. Net interest income of 17.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.0 million, or 12.6 , compared to 15.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 as net interest margin increased 36 basis points to 4.12 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.76 for the three months

 ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the net interest margin was partially offset by a decrease in net interest-earning assets by 26.1 million to 645.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 671.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of a shift in deposit mix which increased interest-bearing deposits. The effect on net interest income of the decrease in the average balance of net interest-earning assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was offset by the asset allocation shift to higher yielding assets. Net interest rate spread increased 16 basis points to 3.29 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.13 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Provision for Credit Losses. A credit to the provision for credit losses of 870,000 was recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a provision for credit losses of 750,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The credit to the provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to improvements in asset quality, economic conditions, and net recoveries, offset in part by growth in the loan portfolio. Non-performing assets were 5.4 million, or 0.27 of total assets, at September 30, 2024, compared to 9.2 million, or 0.49 of total assets, at June 30, 2024 and 14.4 million, or 0.73 of total assets, at September 30, 2023. The allowance for credit losses on loans was 21.2 million at September 30, 2024 and 21.1 million at September 30, 2023, representing 1.49 and 1.72 of total loans outstanding, respectively. Net recoveries were 134,000 or an annualized (0.04) of average loans, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net charge-offs of 5,000, or an annualized 0.00 of average loans, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Non-Interest Income. Non-interest income increased 544,000, or 15.2 , to 4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Noninterest income increased primarily due to a 190,000 increase in insurance and wealth management services income, and a 165,000 net gain on the sale of securities available for sale. The increase in insurance and wealth management services income was primarily as a result of organic growth and positive market performance related to our wealth management services. Non-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense increased 284,000, or 2.0 , to 14.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 14.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits of 743,000, offset in part by a decrease in professional fees of 634,000. Salaries and employee benefits increased due to compensation expense from annual merit increases, hiring talent to fill open positions, as well as due to share-based compensation costs recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2024 for the stock awards granted during the three months ended June 30, 2024. Professional fees decreased due to lower legal fees and expenses as compared to the prior-year period. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense increased 998,000 to 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 890,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in income before income taxes. Our effective tax rate was 23.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 20.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the decrease in tax-exempt income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior-year period. Asset Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses Asset Quality. Non-accrual loans are loans for which collectability is questionable and, therefore, interest on such loans will no longer be recognized on an accrual basis. All loans that become 90 days or more delinquent are placed on non-accrual status unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. When loans are placed on non-accrual status, unpaid accrued interest is fully reversed, and further income is recognized only to the extent received on a cash basis or cost recovery method. When we acquire real estate as a result of foreclosure, the real estate is classified as real estate owned. The real estate owned is recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair market value, less estimated costs to sell. Any excess of the recorded value of the loan over the fair market value of the property is charged against the allowance for credit losses, or, if the existing allowance is inadequate, charged to expense in the current period. After acquisition, all costs incurred in maintaining the property are expensed. Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property, however, are capitalized to the extent of estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell.

Classified Assets . Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities considered to be of lesser quality, as substandard, doubtful or loss. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss allowance is not warranted. Assets which do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated as special mention.

 The following table sets forth our amounts of all classified loans and loans designated as special mention as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024. 

September 30, June 30, 2024 2024 (In thousands) Classification of Loans: Substandard 26,468 22,597 Doubtful 20 33 Loss Total Classified Loans 26,488 22,630 Special Mention 8,489 14,666 Total substandard loans increased 3.9 million to 26.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 22.6 million at June 30, 2024 primarily due to the migration from the special mention category to the substandard category of a 4.7 million commercial real estate loan relationship consisting of four loans secured by multiple office, warehouse and industrial properties. The increase was partially offset by the upgrade to the pass category of a commercial real estate relationship and paydowns on a commercial real estate loan relationship secured by various multi-family properties. Total special mention loans decreased by 6.2 million to 8.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 14.7 million at June 30, 2024 primarily due to the migration to the substandard category from the special mention category of a 4.7 million commercial real estate loan relationship consisting of four loans secured by multiple office, warehouse and industrial properties, and the payoff of a 1.3 million loan relationship. Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans. The measurement of Current Expected Credit Losses CECL on loans requires an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of an exposure (or pool of exposures). The estimate of expected credit losses under the CECL approach is based on relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts. Historical loss experience is generally the starting point for estimating expected credit losses. The Company then considers whether the historical loss experience should be adjusted for asset-specific risk characteristics or current conditions at the reporting date that did not exist over the period from which historical experience was used. Finally, the Company considers forecasts about future economic conditions that are reasonable and supportable. On a case-by-case basis, the Company may conclude that a loan should be evaluated on an individual basis based on its disparate risk characteristics. When the Company determines that a loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with other loans in the portfolio, the allowance will be determined on an individual basis using the present value of expected cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the estimated fair value of the collateral, as applicable. The allowance for credit losses on loans, as reported in our consolidated statements of condition, is adjusted by a provision for credit losses, which is recognized in earnings, and reduced by the charge-off of loans, net of recoveries. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgments by our management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the then-existing loan portfolios, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in those future periods. While management s current evaluation of the allowance for credit losses indicates that the allowance is appropriate, the allowance may need to be increased under adversely different conditions or assumptions. The impact of utilizing the CECL approach to calculate the allowance for credit losses is significantly influenced by the composition, characteristics and quality of our loan portfolios, as well as the prevailing economic conditions and forecasts utilized. Material changes to these and other relevant factors may result in greater volatility to the allowance for credit losses, and therefore, greater volatility to our reported earnings. In addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for credit losses on loans and as a result of such reviews, we may have to materially adjust our allowance for credit losses on loans or recognize further loan charge-offs.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity. Liquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, and proceeds from calls, maturities and sales of securities. We also have the ability to borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York. At September 30, 2024, we had the ability to borrow up to 514.5 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, of which none was utilized for borrowings and 280.0 million was utilized as collateral for letters of credit issued to secure municipal deposits. At September 30, 2024, we also had a 20.0

 million unsecured line of credit with a correspondent bank with no outstanding balance, as well as the ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York through the discount window lending program, and access to the reciprocal and brokered deposit markets. We cannot predict what the impact of the events described in Recent Developments Mann Entities Related Fraudulent Activity above may have on our Liquidity and Capital Resources beyond the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The board of directors is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawals of our customers as well as unanticipated contingencies. We believe that we had enough sources of liquidity to satisfy our short and long-term liquidity needs as of September 30, 2024. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any period. At September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled 225.0 million. Securities classified as available-for-sale, which provide additional sources of liquidity, totaled 262.5 million at September 30, 2024. We are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Certificates of deposit due within one year of September 30, 2024 totaled 146.1 million, or 8.72 , of total deposits. If these deposits do not remain with us, we will be required to seek other sources of funds, including other deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank of New York advances. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or borrowings than we currently pay. We believe, however, based on past experience that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us. We have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered. Capital Resources. We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the OCC. At September 30, 2024, we exceeded all applicable regulatory capital requirements, and were considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines. The Bank is and Pioneer Commercial Bank was subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, banks must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the bank s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgements by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank and Pioneer Commercial Bank to maintain minimum capital amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to average assets (as defined), and common equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and total capital (as defined) to risk-weighted assets (as defined). Under Basel III rules, banks must hold a capital conservation buffer above the adequately capitalized risk-based capital ratios in order to avoid limitations on distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The required capital conservation buffer is 2.50 . The federal banking agencies, including the OCC, issued a rule pursuant to The Economic Growth Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (the Regulatory Relief Act to establish for institutions with assets of less than 10 billion a community bank leverage ratio (the ratio of a bank s tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets) of 9 that qualifying institutions may elect to use in lieu of the generally applicable leverage and risk-based capital requirements under Basel III. If an election to use the community bank leverage ratio capital framework is made, a qualifying bank with less than 10 billion in assets with capital exceeding the specified community bank leverage ratio is considered compliant with all applicable regulatory capital and leverage requirements, including the requirement to be well capitalized. As of September 30, 2024 the Bank had not elected to be subject to the alternative community bank leverage ratio framework.

 As of September 30, 2024, the Bank and Pioneer Commercial Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject. Further, the most recent OCC and FDIC notifications categorized the Bank and Pioneer Commercial Bank as well capitalized institutions under the prompt corrective action regulations. There have been no conditions or events since the notification that management believes have changed the Bank s capital classification including the completion of the Commerical Bank Merger. The actual capital amounts and ratios for the Bank and Pioneer Commercial Bank are presented in the following tables (dollars in thousands):

We are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. The financial instruments include commitments to originate loans, unused lines of credit and standby letters of credit, which involve elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated statements of condition. Our exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of the instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments as we do for on-balance sheet instruments.

Table of Contents 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 285.8 million of commitments to originate or purchase loans, comprised of 177.2 million of commitments under commercial loans and lines of credit (including 59.4 million of unadvanced portions of commercial construction loans), 70.3 million of commitments under home equity loans and lines of credit, 31.2 million of commitments to purchase residential mortgage loans and 7.1 million of unfunded commitments under consumer lines of credit. In addition, at September 30, 2024, we had 21.4 million in standby letters of credit outstanding. Contractual Obligations. In the ordinary course of our operations, we enter into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include data processing services, operating leases for premises and equipment, agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities. Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices Our consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. Unlike industrial companies, our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. As a result, changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than the effects of inflation. Item 3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk A smaller reporting company is not required to provide the information relating to this item. Item 4 Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are the controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company maintains controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must necessarily reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
