 quota share reinsurance agreement (the LPT Agreement) through a loss portfolio transfer transaction with third party reinsurers. The LPT Agreement, which ceded to the reinsurers substantially all of the Fund's outstanding losses as of June 30, 1999 for claims with original dates of injury prior to July 1, 1995, provides coverage for losses up to billion, excluding losses for burial and transportation expenses. The LPT Agreement will remain in effect until: (i) all claims under the covered policies have closed; (ii) the LPT Agreement is commuted or terminated, upon the mutual agreement of the parties; or (iii) the reinsurers aggregate maximum limit of liability is exhausted, whichever occurs first. The LPT Agreement does not provide for any additional termination terms. On January 1, 2000, EICN assumed all of the assets, liabilities and operations of the Fund, including the Fund s rights and obligations associated with the LPT Agreement (See Note 9). 
 The Company accounts for the LPT Agreement as retroactive reinsurance. Upon entry into the LPT Agreement, an initial deferred reinsurance gain (the Deferred Gain) was recorded as a liability on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company was also entitled to a contingent profit commission (Contingent Commission) under the LPT Agreement through June 30, 2024. The Contingent Commission, of which the final installment was determined to be million, was based on actual paid losses under the LPT Agreement through that date and was recorded as an asset on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company received the final installment of the Contingent Commission during the third quarter of 2024. 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), as amended. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal, recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the Company s consolidated financial position and results of operations for the periods presented have been included. The results of operations for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results for an entire year. These financial statements have been prepared consistent with the accounting policies described in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (Annual Report). 
 The Company operates as a single operating segment, Insurance Operations , through its wholly owned subsidiaries. The Company considers an operating segment to be any component of its business whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Company's chief operating decision maker (CODM) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance based on discrete financial information. Prior to December 31, 2023, the Company operated through two reportable segments: Employers and Cerity . All periods prior to December 31, 2023 have been conformed to the current presentation. Detailed financial information about the Company's single operating segment is presented in Note 14. 
 Use of Estimates 
 The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. As a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. The most significant areas that require management judgment are the estimate of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (LAE), evaluation of reinsurance recoverables, recognition of premium revenue, recoverability of deferred income taxes, and valuation of investments.

 Cash and cash equivalents Restricted cash and cash equivalents 
 Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets are categorized based upon the levels of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value. Level inputs are defined as follows: 
 Level 1 - Inputs are unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date. 
 Level 2 - Inputs other than Level 1 prices that are observable for similar assets or liabilities through corroboration with market data at the measurement date. 
 Level 3 - Inputs that are unobservable that reflect management s best estimate of what willing market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities at the measurement date. 
 The Company uses third party pricing services to assist with its investment accounting function. The ultimate pricing source varies depending on the investment security and pricing service used, but investment securities valued on the basis of observable inputs (Levels 1 and 2) are generally assigned values on the basis of actual transactions. Securities valued on the basis of pricing models with significant unobservable inputs or non-binding broker quotes are classified as Level 3. The Company performs quarterly analyses on the prices it receives from third parties to determine whether the prices are reasonable

 Financial Instruments Carried at Cost 
 All of the Company's insurance subsidiaries are members of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (FHLB). Members are required to purchase stock in the FHLB in addition to maintaining collateral deposits that back any funds advanced and standby letters of credit issued (See Note 10). The Company s investment in FHLB stock is recorded at cost, which approximates fair value, as purchases and sales of these securities are at par value with the issuer. FHLB stock is considered a restricted security and is periodically evaluated by the Company for impairment based on the estimated ultimate recovery of par value.

to years, subject to two or three one -year extensions at the general partner s discretion. The Company periodically receives distributions of proceeds from dividends and interest from fund investments, as well as from any dispositions of fund investments during the full course of the fund term. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had unfunded commitments to these private equity limited partnerships totaling million. 
 Additionally, certain cash equivalents, principally money market securities, are measured using NAV, which approximates fair value. 
 The following table presents cash and investments carried at NAV on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had an allowance for current expected credit losses (CECL) on AFS investments of million and million, respectively (See Note 5). Those fixed maturity securities whose total fair value was less than amortized cost at each of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, were those in which the Company had no intent, need or requirement to sell at an amount less than their amortized cost. 
 Realized gains and losses on investments include the gain or loss on a security at the time of sale compared to its original or adjusted cost (equity securities and other invested assets) or amortized cost (fixed maturity securities). Realized losses on fixed maturity securities are also recognized when securities are written down as a result of an other-than-temporary impairment or for unfavorable changes in CECL. Reversals of previously recognized realized losses on fixed maturity securities can also result when securities are written up for favorable changes in CECL.

 Reinsurance Recoverable 
 In assessing an allowance for reinsurance assets, which includes reinsurance recoverables and the Contingent Commission, the Company considers historical information, financial strength of reinsurers, collateralization amounts, and ratings to determine the appropriateness of the allowance. Historically, the Company has not experienced a credit loss from reinsurance transactions. In assessing future default, the Company evaluated the CECL allowance under the ratings-based method using the A.M. Best's Average Cumulative Net Impairment Rates. Reinsurer ratings are also assessed through this process. Changes in the allowance for CECL are recorded through underwriting and general and administrative expenses. 
 Net change in CECL provision Ending balance of CECL on reinsurance recoverables 
 Investments 
 The Company assesses all AFS investments in an unrealized loss position for CECL. The Company first assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria is met, the security's amortized cost basis is written down to its fair value. For AFS investments that do not meet either criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and any adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors.

million. For the Company s investments in fixed maturity debt securities, the allowance for CECL was determined by: (i) observing the credit characteristics of those debt securities that may have demonstrated a credit loss as of that date and by comparing the present value of cash flows expected to be collected to its amortized cost basis; and (ii) observing the credit characteristics of those debt securities that are expected to demonstrate a credit loss in the future by comparing the present value of cash flows expected to be collected to its amortized cost basis. The expected present value of cash flows are calculated using scenario based credit loss models derived from the discounted cash flows under the Comprehensive Capital Analysis Review framework, which is adopted by the Federal Reserve. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not intend to sell any of its AFS investments in which its amortized cost exceeded its fair value. 
 Accrued interest receivable on AFS investments totaled million at September 30, 2024, which is excluded from the estimate of credit losses based on historically timely payments.

 The change in incurred losses and LAE attributable to prior periods for the three months ended September 30, 2024 represented net favorable loss reserve development on the Company's assigned risk business. The change in incurred losses and LAE attributable to prior periods for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 represented net favorable loss reserve development on the Company's voluntary risk business. The net favorable prior year loss reserve development on the Company's voluntary business during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted from overall favorable loss experience, which related primarily to accident years 2022 and prior, partially offset by unfavorable prior year loss experience in accident year 2023 associated with certain large claims. 
 The change in incurred losses and LAE attributable to prior periods for the three months ended September 30, 2023 also represented net favorable loss reserve development on the Company's assigned risk business. The change in incurred losses and LAE attributable to prior periods for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, represented net favorable loss reserve development on the Company's voluntary risk business. The net loss reserve development recognized on voluntary business during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 resulted from overall favorable loss experience, which related primarily to accident years 2020 and prior.

 billion, excluding losses for burial and transportation expenses. The Deferred Gain associated with the LPT Agreement continues to be amortized using the recovery method over the life of the LPT Agreement. The Contingent Commission portion of the Deferred Gain was being amortized using the proportion of actual reinsurance recoveries to total estimated recoveries through June 30, 2024, the date at which it was settled. The amortization of the Deferred Gain, including the portion related to the Contingent Commission prior to its settlement, is recorded in losses and LAE incurred in its Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). Any adjustments to the Deferred Gain are recorded in losses and LAE incurred in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). 
 The Company amortized million and million of the Deferred Gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 General 
 We are a Nevada holding company. Through our insurance subsidiaries, we provide workers compensation insurance coverage to small and select businesses engaged in low-to-medium hazard industries. Workers compensation insurance is provided under a statutory system wherein most employers are required to provide coverage for their employees medical, disability, vocational rehabilitation, and/or death benefit costs for work-related injuries or illnesses. We provide workers compensation insurance throughout most of the United States, with a concentration in California, where 45 of our in-force premiums are generated. Our revenues primarily consist of net premiums earned, net investment income, and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments. 
 The insurance industry is highly competitive, and there is significant competition in the national workers compensation industry that is based on price and quality of services. We compete with other specialty workers compensation carriers, state agencies, multi-line insurance companies, professional employer organizations, self-insurance funds, and state insurance pools. 
 We target small to mid-sized businesses, as we believe that this market is traditionally characterized by more attractive pricing, and stronger persistency when compared to the U.S. workers compensation insurance industry in general. We believe we can price our policies at levels that are competitive and profitable over the long-term given our expertise in underwriting and claims handling in this market segment. Our underwriting approach is to consistently underwrite small to mid-sized business accounts at appropriate and competitive prices without sacrificing long-term profitability and stability for short-term top-line revenue growth. 
 We pursue profitable growth opportunities by focusing on disciplined underwriting and claims management, utilizing medical provider networks designed to produce superior medical and indemnity outcomes, establishing and maintaining strong, long- 
 27 

term relationships with traditional and specialty insurance agencies, developing important alternative distribution channels, and offering workers' compensation solutions directly to customers. 
 We believe we have a cost-effective and scalable information technology infrastructure that complements our geographic reach and business model. We continue to invest in technology to automate business processes and further develop our data analytic capabilities, which we believe will enable us to reduce our operating costs over the long-term and set a foundation for our future needs. Our technology saves our insurance agents and brokers, and our policyholders, considerable time and maintains our competitiveness in our target markets. 
 We also continue to execute a number of ongoing business initiatives, including: achieving internal and customer-facing business process excellence; further diversifying our risk exposure across geographic markets and economic sectors, when appropriate; appetite expansion; and utilizing a multi-company pricing platform and territory-specific pricing. 
 
 Overview 
 Summary Financial Results 
 Our net income was 30.3 million and 90.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 14.0 million and 72.5 million for the corresponding periods of 2023. The key factors that affected our financial performance during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods of 2023, included: 
 Net premiums earned increased 1.1 and 4.7 ; 
 Losses and LAE increased 2.4 and 9.7 ; 
 Underwriting and general and administrative expenses decreased 0.7 and 2.6 ; 
 Underwriting (loss) income of (0.7) million and 7.4 million, compared to (0.5) million and 14.1 million; 
 Other non-recurring expenses of 9.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023; and 
 Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments of 10.9 million and 24.5 million, compared to (7.1) million and 10.7 million. 
 Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 Our 2024 underwriting results reflect moderate increases in net premiums earned, as compared to the same periods of 2023, due to higher new and renewal business premiums, as well as favorable prior year loss reserve development and lower underwriting and general and administrative expenses. Our investment results benefited from strong net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains. 
 Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Our 2023 underwriting results reflect moderate increases in net premiums earned, as compared to the same periods of 2022, due to higher new and renewal business premiums and final audit premiums, as well as strong favorable prior year loss reserve development. Our investment results benefited from strong net investment income. 
 Also, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a 9.4 million non-recurring charge in connection with the early termination of the lease associated with our former corporate headquarters in Reno, Nevada.

I. Review of Underwriting Results 
 Underwriting income or loss is determined by deducting losses and LAE, commission expenses, and underwriting and general and administrative expenses from net premiums earned. Our underwriting results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows: 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in millions) Gross premiums written 181.2 196.2 599.9 589.5 Net premiums written 179.6 194.5 594.8 584.2 Net premiums earned 186.6 184.6 559.3 534.4 Losses and LAE 117.7 114.9 343.0 312.8 Commission expense 26.4 26.7 78.7 73.8 Underwriting and general and administrative expenses 43.2 43.5 130.2 133.7 Total underwriting expenses

 101.2 101.3 99.7 98.4 
 (1) The LPT Agreement is a non-recurring transaction that no longer provides us with any ongoing cash benefits. We provide our underwriting income and combined ratios excluding the effects of the LPT because we believe that these measures are useful in providing investors, analysts and other interested parties a meaningful understanding of our ongoing underwriting performance and provides them with a consistent basis for comparison with other companies in our industry. In addition, we believe that these non-GAAP measures, as presented, are helpful to our management in identifying trends in our performance because the LPT has limited significance to our current and ongoing operations. 
 Gross Premiums Written 
 Gross premiums written were 181.2 million and 599.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 196.2 million and 589.5 million for the corresponding periods of 2023. The growth in new business premiums we experienced is the result of an increase in new submissions, quotes and binds in the majority of the states in which we operate, which is being largely driven by the expansion in the classes of business that we offer, with these increases being offset by lower final audit premiums and endorsements. We also closed another quarter with a record number of policies in-force and our renewal premiums benefited from continued strong retention rates experienced throughout the first nine months of 2024. 
 Net Premiums Written 
 Net premiums written are gross premiums written less reinsurance premiums ceded. For each of the periods presented, the reinsurance premiums ceded related to our annual reinsurance program as further described herein. 
 Net premiums written were 179.6 million and 594.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 194.5 million and 584.2 million for the corresponding periods of 2023. Reinsurance premiums ceded were 1.6 million and 5.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.7 million and 5.3 million for the corresponding periods of 2023. 
 Net Premiums Earned 
 Net premiums earned are primarily a function of the amount and timing of net premiums previously written. 
 Net premiums earned were 186.6 million and 559.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 184.6 million and 534.4 million for the corresponding periods of 2023.

Losses and LAE, Commission Expenses, and Underwriting Expenses 
 The following table presents our calendar year combined ratios. 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Loss and LAE ratio excluding LPT

 101.2 101.3 99.7 98.4 
 Losses and LAE represents our largest expense item and includes claim payments made, amortization of the Deferred Gain, Contingent Commission adjustments, estimates for future claim payments and changes in those estimates for current and prior periods, and costs associated with investigating, defending, and adjusting claims. The quality of our financial reporting depends in large part on accurately predicting our losses and LAE, which are inherently uncertain as they are estimates of the ultimate cost of individual claims based on actuarial estimation techniques. 
 Our current accident year loss and LAE estimates, excluding LPT, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as shown below, are largely consistent with those of the prior periods presented. We believe that our current accident year loss estimate is adequate; however, ultimate losses will not be known with any certainty for many years. Our current accident year loss and LAE ratios continue to reflect the impact of key business initiatives, including: an emphasis on accelerated settlements of open claims; further diversifying its risk exposure across geographic markets, when appropriate; and leveraging data-driven strategies to target, underwrite, and price profitable classes of business across all of our markets. 
 Loss and LAE Ratio. We analyze our loss and LAE ratios on both a calendar year and accident year basis. 
 The calendar year loss and LAE ratio is calculated by dividing the losses and LAE recorded during the calendar year, regardless of when the underlying insured event occurred, by the net premiums earned during that calendar year. The calendar year loss and LAE ratio reflects changes made during the calendar year in reserves for losses and LAE established for insured events occurring in the current and prior years. The calendar year loss and LAE ratio for a particular year will not change in future periods. 
 The accident year loss and LAE ratio is calculated by dividing cumulative losses and LAE for reported events that occurred during a particular year by the net premiums earned for that year. The accident year loss and LAE ratio for a particular year can decrease or increase when recalculated in subsequent periods as the reserves established for insured events occurring during that year fluctuate. 
 Our calendar year loss and LAE ratio is analyzed to measure profitability in a particular year and to evaluate the adequacy of premium rates charged in a particular year to cover expected losses and LAE from all periods, including development (whether favorable or unfavorable) of reserves established in prior periods. In contrast, our accident year loss and LAE ratios are analyzed to evaluate underwriting performance and the adequacy of the premium rates charged in a particular year in relation to ultimate losses and LAE from insured events occurring during that year. The loss and LAE ratios provided in this report are on a calendar year basis, except where they are expressly identified as accident year loss and LAE ratios. 
 The table below reflects prior accident year loss and LAE reserve adjustments and the impact to loss ratio.

The increase in our calendar year losses and LAE during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period of 2023, was primarily due to higher earned premiums and a slightly higher current accident year loss and LAE estimate. Favorable prior year loss reserve development on our assigned risk business totaled 0.1 million during each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 The increase in our calendar year losses and LAE during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period of 2023, was primarily due to higher earned premiums, a slightly higher current accident year loss and LAE estimate, and lower net favorable prior year loss reserve development. Favorable prior year loss reserve development on our voluntary risk business totaled 9.3 million and 20.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The favorable prior year loss development on our voluntary business during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted from overall favorable loss experience, which related primarily to accident years 2022 and prior, partially offset by unfavorable prior year loss experience in accident year 2023 associated with certain large claims. 
 The favorable prior year loss development on our voluntary business during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 resulted from overall favorable loss experience, which related primarily to accident years 2020 and prior. 
 The table below reflects the impact of the LPT on Losses and LAE, which are recorded as a reduction to Losses and LAE incurred on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).

 Commission Expenses Ratio 
 Commission expenses include direct commissions to our agents and brokers, including our partnerships and alliances, for the premiums that they produce for us, as well as agency incentive payments, other marketing costs, and fees. 
 Our commission expense ratio was 14.1 for each of the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to 14.5 and 13.8 for the corresponding periods of 2023, and our commission expenses were 26.4 million and 78.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 26.7 million and 73.8 million for the corresponding periods of 2023. The decrease in our commission expense ratio for three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to lower agency incentive accruals, which are specific to individual contracts and vary with agency targets. The increase in our commission expense ratio for nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to: (i) an increase in new business writings year-over-year; and (ii) a reduction in commission expense for uncollected premium recorded in the second quarter of 2023. 
 Underwriting and General and Administrative Expense Ratio 
 Underwriting and general and administrative expenses represent those costs that we incur to underwrite and maintain the insurance policies we issue, excluding commissions. Variable underwriting expenses, such as premium taxes, policyholder dividends, and those expenses that vary directly with the production of new or renewal business, are recognized as the associated premiums are earned. Fixed underwriting expenses, such as the operating expenses of EHI and its subsidiaries, do not vary directly with the production of new or renewal business and are recognized as incurred. 
 Our underwriting and general and administrative expense ratio was 23.2 and 23.3 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 23.6 and 25.0 for the corresponding periods of 2023, and our underwriting expenses were 43.2 million and 130.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 43.5 million and 133.7 million for the corresponding periods of 2023. 
 The decreases in underwriting expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were primarily the result of decreases in professional fees of 1.7 million and depreciation and amortization of 1.4 million, partially offset by increases in the net CECL provision on premiums receivable of 2.3 million, and premium taxes and assessments of 0.3 million, each compared to the same period of 2023. 
 The decreases in underwriting expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were primarily the result of decreases in professional fees of 4.9 million, depreciation and amortization of 3.3 million and marketing and advertising expenses of 2.0 million, partially offset by increases in the net CECL provision on premiums receivable of 4.8 million and compensation- 
 32 

related expenses of 2.3 million, each compared to the same period of 2023. The integration plan we executed in the fourth quarter of 2023, which consolidated our previously segregated direct-to-consumer operations (Cerity) into our mainstream operations, was a meaningful contributor to the expense reduction for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 II. Review of Non-Underwriting Results 
 Net Investment Income and Net Realized and Unrealized Gains and Losses on Investments 
 We invest in fixed maturity securities, equity securities, other invested assets, short-term investments, and cash equivalents. Net investment income includes interest and dividends earned on our invested assets and amortization of premiums and discounts on our fixed maturity securities, less bank service charges and custodial and portfolio management fees. 
 Net investment income increased 2.7 and remained flat during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods of 2023. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to higher yields within the Company's fixed maturity portfolio. The consistent level of investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, versus that of the prior year, was due to higher yields within the Company s fixed maturity portfolio and its cash equivalents being partially offset by a lower invested balance of fixed maturity securities, as measured by amortized cost. The lower invested balances in the current period resulting primarily from the unwinding of our former FHLB leveraged investment strategy, which was in effect from the first quarter of 2022 to the fourth quarter of 2023. Pursuant to that strategy, certain of our insurance subsidiaries had received aggregate advances under the FHLB Standard Credit Program, the proceeds from which were used to purchase an equivalent amount of high-quality collateralized loan obligation securities. 
 Realized and unrealized gains and losses on our investments are reported separately from our net investment income. Realized gains and losses on investments include the gain or loss on a security at the time of sale compared to its original or adjusted cost (equity securities) or amortized cost (fixed maturity securities). Realized losses are also recognized for adverse changes in our CECL allowance or when securities are written down because of an other-than-temporary impairment. Changes in the fair value of equity securities and other invested assets are also included in Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). 
 Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments were 10.9 million and 24.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to (7.1) million and 10.7 million for the corresponding periods of 2023. The net realized and unrealized gains on investments for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included 12.8 million and (5.9) million of net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities and other investments, respectively, and 1.9 million and 1.2 million of net realized losses on fixed maturity securities, respectively. The net realized and unrealized gains on investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included 30.8 million and 13.6 million of net realized and unrealized gains on equity securities and other investments, respectively, and 6.3 million and 2.9 million of net realized losses on fixed maturity securities, respectively. 
 The net investment gains and losses on our equity securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were largely consistent with the performance of the U.S. equity markets. The net realized investment losses on our fixed maturity securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily the result of sales associated with the rebalancing of our fixed maturity investment portfolio partially offset by decreases of 0.5 million and 1.3 million in our allowance for CECL, respectively. 
 The net investment gains and losses on our equity securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were largely consistent with the performance of the U.S. equity markets. The net realized investment losses on our fixed maturity securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were largely concentrated in certain holdings in the financial and banking sectors, and were partially offset by decreases of 1.1 million and 1.3 million in our allowance for CECL, respectively. 
 Additional information regarding our Investments is set forth under Liquidity and Capital Resources Investments. 
 Other Income (Loss) 
 Other income (loss) consists of net gains and losses on fixed assets, non-investment interest, and other miscellaneous income and expense items. 
 Interest and Financing Expenses 
 Interest and financing expenses include fees and interest associated with our credit facilities, fees and interest associated with our various credit arrangements with the FHLB, finance lease interest, and other financing fees. 
 Interest and financing expenses were less than 0.1 million and 0.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.0 million and 5.2 million for the corresponding periods of 2023. The decreases resulted primarily from the unwinding of our former FHLB leveraged investment strategy, which was in effect from the first quarter of 2022 to the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 33 

Other Expenses 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a 9.4 million non-recurring charge in connection with the early termination of the lease associated with our former corporate headquarters in Reno, Nevada. This charge included a one-time lease termination payment of 7.6 million, a write-off related to remaining leasehold improvements and furniture and equipment of 2.6 million, and estimated miscellaneous expenses associated with exiting the property of 0.2 million. We also recognized a related lease termination gain pertaining to the elimination of the lease liability, net of an associated ROU asset of 1.0 million, which was included in Other expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). The decision to terminate this operating lease was undertaken as part of an ongoing review of our facility needs. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Income tax expense was 6.4 million and 21.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 3.4 million and 17.8 million for the corresponding periods of 2023. The effective tax rates were 17.4 and 19.4 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 19.5 and 19.7 for the corresponding periods of 2023. The effective rates during each of the periods presented included income tax benefits and exclusions associated with tax-advantaged investment income, LPT adjustments, Deferred Gain amortization and related adjustments, and tax credits utilized. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We believe that our total capital position remains strong and that the liquidity available to EHI and its subsidiaries remains adequate and will be sufficient for our financing needs in the next 12 months and in the longer-term period thereafter. As a result, we do not currently foresee a need to: (i) suspend dividends at either EHI or its insurance subsidiaries; (ii) forego repurchases of EHI's common stock; (iii) seek additional required capital; or (iii) seek any material non-investment asset sales, though we may decide to pursue those or other options if our financial circumstances change or it we deem it strategically advantageous to do so. 
 EHI Liquidity 
 EHI is a holding company and its ability to fund its operations is contingent upon its existing capital and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay it dividends. Payment of dividends by EHI's insurance subsidiaries is restricted by state insurance laws and regulations, including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds. EHI requires cash to pay dividends to its stockholders, repurchase its common stock, provide additional surplus to its insurance subsidiaries, and fund its operating expenses. 
 EHI's insurance subsidiaries ability to pay dividends and distributions is based on their reported capital, surplus, and dividends paid within the prior twelve months. 
 During the first quarter of 2024, ECIC made a 23.3 million dividend payment to EGI, which in turn distributed that amount to EHI. As a result of that dividend payment, ECIC cannot pay dividends for the remainder of 2024 without prior regulatory approval. 
 During the first quarter of 2024, EICN made a 13.7 million dividend payment to EGI, which in turn distributed that amount to EHI. As a result of that dividend payment, EICN cannot pay any dividends for the remainder of 2024 without prior regulatory approval. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, EPIC made a 23.2 million dividend payment to EGI, which in turn distributed that amount to EHI. As a result of that dividend payment, EPIC cannot pay dividends for the remainder of 2024 without prior regulatory approval. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, EAC made a 22.4 million dividend payment to EGI, which in turn distributed that amount to EHI. As a result of that dividend payment, EAC cannot pay dividends for the remainder of 2024 without prior regulatory approval. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, CIC made a 5.7 million dividend payment to EGI, which in turn distributed that amount to EHI. As a result of that dividend payment, CIC cannot pay dividends for the remainder of 2024 without prior regulatory approval. 
 Total cash and investments at EHI were 76.8 million at September 30, 2024, consisting of 31.1 million of cash and cash equivalents, 20.5 million of fixed maturity securities, and 25.2 million of equity securities. 
 On May 28, 2024, EHI entered into the Credit Agreement which provides for a 25.0 million, unsecured, three-year revolving credit facility and is guaranteed by EGI and CGI. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes of EHI and its subsidiaries. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, EHI has an option to 
 34 

request an increase of the credit available under the facility up to a maximum facility amount of 35.0 million, subject to the consent of the lender(s) and the satisfaction of certain conditions. 
 The interest rates applicable to loans under the Credit Agreement are generally based on, at EHI's option: (i) a base rate, defined as the higher of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 1.25 and the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate for a one-month tenor plus 1.75 , or (ii) an Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, defined as the applicable Adjusted Term SOFR Rate plus 1.75 . Borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes of EHI and its subsidiaries. Total interest paid and/or fees incurred pursuant to the Credit Agreement was less than 0.1 million for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The Credit Agreement contains covenants that require EHI and its consolidated subsidiaries to maintain: (i) a minimum consolidated net worth, defined as EHI s total stockholders equity excluding any accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, of no less than 800.0 million; and (ii) a debt to total capitalization ratio of no more than 35 , in each case as determined in accordance with the Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, EHI has remained in compliance with all of the covenants associated with the Credit Agreement since its inception. 
 EHI had no borrowings under the Credit Agreement during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Operating Subsidiaries Liquidity 
 The primary sources of cash for our operating subsidiaries, which include our insurance and other operating subsidiaries, are premium collections, investment income, sales and maturities of investments, and reinsurance recoveries. The primary uses of cash for our operating subsidiaries are payments of losses and LAE, commission expenses, underwriting and general and administrative expenses, ceded reinsurance, investment purchases and dividends paid to their parent. 
 Total cash and investments held by our operating subsidiaries was 2,524.7 million at September 30, 2024, consisting of 112.4 million of cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash, 30.6 million of short-term investments, 2,045.3 million of fixed maturity securities, 236.7 million of equity securities, and 99.7 million of other invested assets. Sources of immediate and unencumbered liquidity at our operating subsidiaries as of September 30, 2024 consisted of 112.2 million of cash and cash equivalents, 231.0 million of publicly traded equity securities whose proceeds are available within two business days and 690.8 million of highly liquid fixed maturity securities whose proceeds are also available within two business days. We believe that our subsidiaries liquidity needs over the next 12 months and for the longer-term period thereafter will be met with cash from operations, investment income, and maturing investments. 
 All of our insurance subsidiaries are members of the FHLB. Membership allows our subsidiaries access to collateralized advances, which may be used to support and enhance liquidity management. The amount of advances that may be taken is dependent on our statutory admitted assets on a per company basis. 
 FHLB membership also allows our insurance subsidiaries access to standby Letter of Credit Agreements. Letter of Credit Agreements we currently have in effect will expire March 31, 2025 and must be fully secured with eligible collateral at all times (See Note 10). 
 Various state laws and regulations require us to hold investment securities or letters of credit on deposit with certain states in which we do business. Securities having a fair value of 746.1 million and 748.1 million were on deposit at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These laws and regulations govern both the amount and types of investment securities that are eligible for deposit. Additionally, standby letters of credit from the FHLB have been issued in lieu of 70.0 million of securities on deposit at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 We purchase reinsurance annually to protect us against the costs of severe claims and certain catastrophic events. On July 1, 2024, we entered into a new reinsurance program that is effective through June 30, 2025. The reinsurance program consists of one treaty covering excess of loss and catastrophic loss events in four layers of coverage. Our reinsurance coverage is 190.0 million in excess of our 10.0 million retention on a per occurrence basis, subject to certain exclusions. We believe that our reinsurance program currently meets our needs. 
 Certain reinsurance contracts require funds owned by us to be held in trust for the benefit of the ceding reinsurer to secure the outstanding liabilities we have assumed. The fair value of fixed maturity securities held in trust for the benefit of our ceding reinsurers was 3.1 million and 3.0 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 We monitor the cash flows of each of our subsidiaries individually, as well as collectively as a consolidated group. We use trend and variance analyses to project future cash needs, making adjustments to our cash forecasts as appropriate. 
 35 

The table below shows our net cash flows for the nine months ended: 
 September 30, 2024 2023 (in millions) Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 63.3 21.8 Investing activities (89.7) 225.0 Financing activities (56.7) (227.2) (Decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 
 (83.1) 19.6 
 For additional information regarding our cash flows, see Item 1, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, included net premiums received of 575.4 million, investment income received of 79.8 million, and cash received of 14.6 million for the Contingent Commission. The cash provided by these operating activities were partially offset by net claims payments of 381.7 million, underwriting and general and administrative expenses paid of 124.1 million, commissions paid of 77.6 million, and federal income taxes paid of 23.0 million. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, included net premiums received of 521.1 million and investment income received of 83.2 million. These operating cash inflows were partially offset by net claims payments of 351.8 million, underwriting and general and administrative expenses paid of 125.2 million, commissions paid of 68.6 million, interest paid of 5.2 million, lease termination and related disposal payments of 7.8 million, and federal income taxes paid of 23.9 million. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, related primarily to investments of premiums received, the receipt of the Contingent Commission, and the reinvestment of funds from investment sales, maturities, redemptions, and interest income. Those investing cash outflows were partially offset by investment sales, maturities, and redemptions whose proceeds were used to fund claims payments, underwriting and general and administrative expenses, stockholder dividend payments, and common stock repurchases. 
 Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily related to investment sales, maturities, and redemptions whose proceeds were used to fund claims payments, underwriting and general and administrative expenses, stockholder dividend payments, common stock repurchases, and to repay FHLB advances. Those investing cash inflows were partially offset by the investment of premiums received and reinvestment of funds from investment sales, maturities, redemptions, and interest income. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, related primarily to stockholder dividend payments and common stock repurchases. 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, related primarily to stockholder dividend payments, common stock repurchases, and repayments of FHLB advances. 
 Dividends 
 We paid 22.8 million and 22.5 million in dividends to our stockholders and eligible equity plan award holders for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The declaration and payment of future dividends to our stockholders, including any special dividends that may be declared in the future, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors (Board) and will depend upon many factors including our financial position, capital requirements of our operating subsidiaries, legal and regulatory requirements, and any other factors that our Board deems relevant. On October 30, 2024, the Board declared a quarterly dividend per share of 0.30, which is payable November 27, 2024 to stockholders of record on November 13, 2024. 
 Stock Repurchases 
 We repurchased 163,221 shares of our common stock for 7.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and we repurchased 748,083 shares of our common stock for 31.4 million during nine months ended September 30, 2024. Future repurchases of our common stock will be at the discretion of our Board and will depend upon many factors, including our financial position, capital requirements of our operating subsidiaries, general business and socioeconomic conditions, legal, tax, regulatory, and/or contractual restrictions, and any other factors that our Board deems relevant. 
 36 

Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, the capital resources available to us consisted of 1,093.4 million of stockholders equity and the 93.8 million Deferred Gain. 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 Other than operating expenses, our current and long-term cash requirements include the following contractual obligations and commitments as of September 30, 2024: 
 Leases 
 We have entered into lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities. As of September 30, 2024, we had lease payment obligations totaling 4.9 million, of which 1.7 million is payable within 12 months. 
 Other Purchase Obligations 
 We have other purchase obligations that primarily consist of non-cancellable obligations to acquire capital assets, commitments for information technology and related services, software acquisition and license commitments and other legally binding agreements to purchase services that are to be used in our operations. As of September 30, 2024, we had other purchase obligations totaling 11.1 million, of which 3.4 million is payable within 12 months. 
 Unfunded Investment Commitments 
 We have investments in private equity limited partnerships that require capital distributions to fund the investments and can be called at any time. As of September 30, 2024, we had unfunded investment commitments totaling 18.1 million. 
 Unpaid Losses and LAE Expenses 
 We have developed unpaid losses and LAE expense payment patterns that are computed based on historical information. Our calculation of loss and LAE expense payments by period is subject to the same uncertainties associated with determining the level of reserves and to the additional uncertainties arising from the difficulty of predicting when claims (including claims that have not yet been reported to us) will be paid. Actual payments of losses and LAE by period will vary, perhaps materially, to the extent that current estimates of losses and LAE expense vary from actual ultimate claims amounts due to variations between expected and actual payment patterns. As of September 30, 2024, we had unpaid losses and LAE reserves totaling 1,836.5 million, of which 314.5 million is currently expected to be paid within 12 months. 
 The unpaid losses and LAE expense payment patterns are gross of reinsurance recoverables for unpaid losses. As of September 30, 2024, we had reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses and LAE totaling 413.1 million, of which 29.5 million is currently expected to be received within 12 months. 
 Investments 
 Our investment portfolio is structured to support our need for: (i) optimizing our risk-adjusted total returns; (ii) providing adequate liquidity; (iii) facilitating financial strength and stability; and (iv) ensuring regulatory and legal compliance. These investments provide a steady source of income, which may fluctuate with changes in interest rates and our current investment strategies. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our investment portfolio consisted of 84 fixed maturity securities which had a duration of 4.2 at September 30, 2024. Our investment strategy balances consideration of duration, yield, and credit risk. Our investment guidelines require that the minimum weighted average quality of our fixed maturity securities portfolio be A, using ratings assigned by Standard Poor s (S P) or an equivalent rating assigned by another nationally recognized statistical rating agency. Our fixed maturity portfolio had a weighted average quality of A+ as of September 30, 2024. 
 Our investment portfolio also contains equity securities. We strive to limit the exposure to equity price risk associated with publicly traded equity securities by diversifying our holdings across several industry sectors. These equity securities had a fair value of 256.2 million at September 30, 2024, which represented 11 of our investment portfolio at that time. We also have a 5.7 million investment in FHLB stock which we record at cost. We receive periodic dividends from the FHLB for this investment, when declared, which can vary from period to period. 
 Our investment portfolio also contains certain other investments, which made up 4 of our investment portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and include private equity limited partnerships. Our investments in private equity limited partnerships totaled 99.7 million at September 30, 2024 and are generally not redeemable by the investees and cannot be sold without prior approval of the general partner. These investments have a fund term of 3 to 12 years, subject to two or three one-year extensions at the general partner s discretion. We periodically receive distributions of proceeds from dividends and interest from fund investments, as well as from any dispositions of fund investments, during the full course of the fund term. As of September 30, 2024, we had unfunded commitments to these private equity limited partnerships totaling 18.1 million. 
 37 

We believe that our current asset allocation meets our strategy to preserve capital for claims and policy liabilities and to provide sufficient capital resources to support and grow our ongoing insurance operations. 
 The following table shows the estimated fair value, the percentage of the fair value to total invested assets, and the average ending book yield (which is calculated based on the amortized cost of the associated invested assets) as of September 30, 2024. 
 Category Estimated Fair Value Percentage of Total Book Yield (in millions, except percentages) U.S. Treasuries 62.1 2.6 3.3 States and municipalities 183.0 7.8 4.3 Corporate securities 905.7 38.5 4.0 Residential mortgage-backed securities 459.4 19.5 4.0 Commercial mortgage-backed securities 60.7 2.6 3.6 Asset-backed securities 210.1 8.9 5.3 Collateralized loan obligations 53.1 2.3 7.1 Foreign government securities 10.3 0.4 2.8 Other securities 121.4 5.2 8.2 Equity securities 256.2 10.9 2.9 Short-term investments 30.6 1.3 5.0 Total investments at fair value 2,352.6 100.0 Weighted average book yield

 The following table shows the percentage of total estimated fair value of our fixed maturity securities as of September 30, 2024 by credit rating category, using the lower of the ratings assigned by Moody s Investors Service or S P. 
 Rating Percentage of Total Estimated Fair Value AAA 12.6 AA 35.7 A 32.2 BBB 12.0 Below Investment Grade 7.5 Total 100.0 
 Investments that we currently own could be subject to default by the issuer. We regularly assess individual securities as part of our ongoing portfolio management, including the identification of credit related losses. Our assessment includes reviewing the extent of declines in fair value of investments below amortized cost, historical and projected financial performance and near-term prospects of the issuer, the outlook for industry sectors, credit rating, and macro-economic changes. We also make a determination as to whether it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before its fair value recovers to above cost, or maturity. 
 In addition to recognizing realized gains and losses upon the disposition of an investment security, we also recognize realized losses and recoveries of previously recorded realized losses on AFS investments for changes in CECL. As of September 30, 2024, we maintained a CECL allowance of 1.4 million on AFS investments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a net 1.3 million decrease to our allowance for CECL on AFS investments. The remaining fixed maturity securities whose total fair value was less than amortized cost at September 30, 2024, were those in which we had no intent, need, or requirement to sell at an amount less than their amortized cost. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report include amounts based on the use of estimates and judgments of management for those transactions that are not yet complete. We believe that the estimates and judgments that were most critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements involved the reserves for losses and LAE and reinsurance recoverables. These estimates and judgments require the use of assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and therefore are subject to change as facts and circumstances develop. Our accounting policies are discussed under 
 38 

"Critical Accounting Estimates" in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market risk is the risk of potential economic loss principally arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments. The major components of market risk affecting us are credit risk, interest rate risk, and equity price risk. 
 Credit Risk 
 Our fixed maturity securities, equity securities, other invested assets and cash equivalents are exposed to credit risk, which we attempt to mitigate through issuer and industry diversification. Our investment guidelines include limitations on the minimum rating of fixed maturity securities and concentrations of a single issuer. 
 We also bear credit risk with respect to the reinsurers, which can be significant considering that some loss reserves remain outstanding for an extended period of time. We are required to pay losses even if a reinsurer refuses or fails to meet its obligations to us under the applicable reinsurance agreement(s). We continually monitor the financial condition and financial strength ratings of our reinsurers. Additionally, we bear credit risk with respect to premiums receivable, which is generally diversified due to the large number of entities comprising our policyholder base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographies. 
 The economic disruptions caused by financial market volatility, inflationary pressures, and heightened geo-political conditions, have impacted the credit risk associated with certain of our investment holdings. As of September 30, 2024, we maintained a 1.4 million allowance for CECL on our fixed maturity portfolio. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Investments 
 Our fixed maturity securities are also exposed to interest rate risk, which is the risk of a change in fair value resulting from changes in prevailing interest rates, which we manage through duration. Our fixed maturity investments (excluding cash and cash equivalents) had a duration of 4.2 at September 30, 2024. Our investment strategy balances consideration of duration, yield and credit risk. We continually monitor the changes in interest rates and their impact on our liquidity and ability to meet our obligations. 
 Sensitivity Analysis 
 The fair values or cash flows of market sensitive instruments are subject to potential losses in future earnings resulting from changes in interest rates and other market conditions. Our sensitivity analysis applies a hypothetical parallel shift in market rates and reflects what we believe are reasonably possible near-term changes in those rates (covering a period of time going forward up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements). Actual results may differ from the hypothetical change in market rates assumed in this disclosure. This sensitivity analysis does not reflect the results of any action that we may take to mitigate such hypothetical losses in fair value. 
 We use fair values to measure our potential loss in this model, which includes fixed maturity securities and short-term investments. For invested assets, we use modified duration modeling to calculate changes in fair values. Durations on invested assets are adjusted for call, put, and interest rate reset features. Invested asset portfolio durations are calculated on a market value weighted basis, excluding accrued investment income, using holdings as of September 30, 2024. The estimated changes in fair values on our fixed maturity securities and short-term investments, which had an aggregate value of 2,096.4 million as of September 30, 2024, based on specific changes in interest rates are as follows: 
 Hypothetical Changes in Interest Rates Estimated Pre-tax Increase (Decrease) in Fair Value (in millions, except percentages) 300 basis point rise (246.7) (11.9) 200 basis point rise (167.5) (8.1) 100 basis point rise (82.9) (4.0) 50 basis point decline 53.0 2.6 100 basis point decline 100.4 4.8 200 basis point decline 197.7 9.5 300 basis point decline 297.2 14.3 
 The most significant assessment of the effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on investment income would be based on GAAP guidance related to " Accounting for Nonrefundable Fees and Costs Associated with Originating or Acquiring Loans and Initial Direct Costs of Leases, " which requires amortization adjustments for mortgage-backed securities. The rates at which the 
 39 

mortgages underlying mortgage-backed securities are prepaid, and therefore the average life of mortgage-backed securities, can vary depending on changes in interest rates (for example, mortgages tend to prepay faster and the average life of mortgage-backed securities falls when interest rates decline). Adjustments for changes in amortization are based on revised average life assumptions and would have an impact on investment income if a significant portion of our commercial and residential mortgage-backed securities were purchased at significant discounts or premiums to par value. As of September 30, 2024, the par value of our commercial and residential mortgage-backed securities holdings was 543.4 million, and the amortized cost was 102.0 of par value. Since a majority of our mortgage-backed securities were purchased at a premium that is significant as a percentage of par, an adjustment could have a significant effect on investment income. The commercial and residential mortgage-backed securities portion of the portfolio represented 22.1 of our total investments as of September 30, 2024. Agency-backed residential mortgage pass-throughs represented 73.0 of the residential mortgage-backed securities portion of the portfolio as of September 30, 2024. 
 Equity Price Risk 
 Equity price risk is the risk that we may incur losses in the fair value of the equity securities we hold in our investment portfolio. Adverse changes in the market prices of the equity securities we hold in our investment portfolio would result in decreases in the fair value of our total assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and in net realized and unrealized gains on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). Economic and market disruptions caused by geo-political conditions, inflationary pressures and credit concerns in certain financial and banking markets, have resulted in volatility in the fair value of our equity securities. We minimize our exposure to equity price risk by investing primarily in the equity securities of mid-to-large capitalization issuers and by diversifying our equity holdings across several industry sectors. 
 The table below shows the sensitivity of our equity securities at fair value to price changes as of September 30, 2024: 
 (in millions) Cost Fair Value 10 Fair Value Decrease Pre-tax Impact on Decrease in Total Equity Securities 10 Fair Value Increase Pre-tax Impact on Increase in Total Equity Securities Equity securities 144.7 256.2 230.6 (25.6) 281.8 25.6 
 Effects of Inflation 
 In recent years, economic slowdowns, financial market volatility, monetary and fiscal policy measures, heightened geo-political tensions and fluctuations in interest rates have contributed to higher levels of inflation and may continue to lead to elevated levels of inflation in future periods. 
 Higher levels of inflation than we have anticipated could significantly impact our financial statements and results of operations. Our estimates for losses and LAE include assumptions about the timing of closure and future payment of claims and claims handling expenses, such as medical treatments and litigation costs. Inflation is also incorporated in our reserving process through projections supported by historical loss emergence. Under the current elevated inflationary environment, additional inflationary considerations were included in determining the level and adequacy of our reserves, and particular consideration was given to medical and hospital inflation rates as these inflation rates have historically exceeded general inflation rates. To the extent that inflation causes these costs to increase above established reserves, we will be required to increase those reserves for losses and LAE, reducing our earnings in the period in which our assumptions are revised. 
 Higher levels of wage inflation can specifically impact the payrolls of our insureds, which is the basis for the premiums we charge, as well as amount of future indemnity losses we may incur. 
 Higher levels of inflation could also adversely impact certain of our operating expenses and, in the case of wage inflation, could adversely impact our payroll expenses. 
 Increases in market interest rates that have occurred in recent years, which were intended to aid in the suppression of inflation, continue to negatively impact the market value of our existing fixed maturity investments while also having the effect of increasing our net investment income. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 40 

There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 41 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time-to-time, we are involved in pending and threatened litigation in the normal course of business in which claims for monetary damages are asserted.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 We have disclosed in our Annual Report the most significant risk factors that can impact year-to-year comparisons and that may affect the future performance of our business. On a quarterly basis, we review these disclosures and update the risk factors, as appropriate. As of the date of this report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors contained in our Annual Report.
