Key Factors that Affect
Operating Results 

Competition 

E-commerce and live streaming
is a competitive industry. Our competition varies and includes content creators on TikTok and other social media platform. Each of these
competitors competes with us based on quality of content, activeness and responsiveness on the social placement, product selection, product
quality, customer service, price, store format, location, or a combination of these factors. Some of these competitors may have been in
business longer, may have more experience, or may have greater financial or marketing resources than us. As competition intensifies, our
results of operations may be negatively impacted through a loss of sales and decrease in market share. 

Retention of Key Management
Team Members 

Our management team comprises
executives with extensive experience in technology and content creation. The management team has led us to take leaps in deploying AI
technology in live-steaming, e-commerce, gaming and other sectors. The loss of any of our key executive team member might affect our business
and our result of operation. 

Our Ability to Grow
Market Presence and Penetrate New Markets 

We are still in an early
development stage. We intend to expand our presence on social media to increase the market presence. If we cannot grow market presence
and penetrate new markets in an effective and cost-efficient way, our results of operation will be negatively impacted. 

33 

Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic 

The COVID-19 pandemic
did not have a material impact on our business or results of operation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. However,
the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively impact the general economy and our business is highly uncertain and cannot be
accurately predicted. These uncertainties may impede our ability to conduct our operations and could materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations, and as a result could adversely affect our stock price and create more volatility.

Revenues 

The Company s revenue
consists of software copyright. Total revenues decreased by approximately 150,000 to nil for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
compared to approximately 150,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was mainly due to no sales of software copyright
in 2024. 

Gross Profit 

The Company s gross
profit decreased by 150,000 to nil, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 150,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The decrease was due to no sales of software copyright in 2024. 

Operating Expenses 

The Company s operating
expenses include selling and marketing S M expenses, general and administrative G A expenses,
research and development R D expenses. S M expenses increased to 2.4 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2024, compared to nil for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was mainly due to the Company increased inputs on
digital human and e-commerce live streaming marketing and advertising to improve its brand reputation, attract a large following on social
media. G A expenses increased by approximately 2.4 million from approximately 1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2023 to approximately 4.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was mainly due to the combined impact of
(i) the expansion of our administrative associated personnel cost, (ii) increase in operating and lease expenses for offices, (iii) increase
in the professional service fee and (iv) amortization of intangible assets. R D expenses increased to approximately 0.7 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to nil for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was mainly due to
the Company increased inputs on research and development about our artificial intelligence based digital human application, to create
unconventional digital characters and customize digital humans to support the clients marketing efforts. 

Other Income (Expenses) 

The Company s other
income decreased by approximately 4.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 147,018 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was mainly due to the other-than-temporary impairment losses from convertible notes and intangible
assets. 

Loss from Continuing Operations 

As a result of the foregoing,
loss from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 11.6 million, an increase of approximately
635.8 , from loss from continuing operations of approximately 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net Loss 

The Company s net
loss increased by approximately 7.9 million, or 212.6 , to approximately 11.6 million net loss for the nine months ended September 30,
2024, from approximately 3.7 million net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was mainly due to the increase
on operating expenses as described above and the other-than-temporary impairment losses from convertible notes and intangible assets. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The Company prepares
its unaudited consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these unaudited consolidated financial
statements requires the Company to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that can significantly impact the amounts the Company reports
as assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and the related disclosures. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience
and other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The Company s actual results could differ significantly
from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. The Company has identified the following key accounting estimates: 

36 

Convertible Notes
Receivable 

The Company evaluated
the terms of the DigiTrax Convertible Notes and the Liquid Convertible Notes (as defined in Note 12 of the unaudited consolidated financial
statements) according to ASC 320 Investments Debt Securities and concluded that the convertible notes should be
classified as an available-for-sale security and measured at fair value. To evaluate the fair value of the available-for-sale security,
the Company used the valuation methodology of income approach, which is determined by the future cash flow forecast. The fair value changes
of these notes were recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income on the accompanying unaudited consolidated statements of operations
and comprehensive loss for the three months ended as of the reporting period. 

The Company
evaluates quarterly whether AFS securities are other-than-temporarily impaired (OTTI) based on criteria that include the extent to which
cost exceeds market value, the duration of the market decline, the credit rating of the issuer or security, the failure of the issuer
to make scheduled principal or interest payments, and the financial health and prospects of the issuer or security. 

Declines
in the value of AFS securities determined to be OTTI are recognized in earnings and included in other-than-temporary impairment losses.
Debt securities with unrealized losses are considered OTTI if the Company intends to sell the security or if the Company will be required
to sell the security prior to any anticipated recovery. If the Company determines that a security is OTTI under these circumstances, the
impairment recognized in earnings is measured as the difference between the amortized cost and the current fair value. A debt security
is also determined to be OTTI if the Company does not expect to recover the amortized cost of the security. However, in this circumstance,
if the Company does not intend to sell the security and will not be required to sell the security, the impairment recognized in earnings
equals the estimated credit loss as measured by the difference between the present value of expected cash flows and the amortized cost
of the security. Expected cash flows are discounted using the security s effective interest rate. An equity security is determined
to be OTTI if the Company does not expect to recover the cost of the security. Declines in the value of AFS securities determined to be
temporary are reported, net of tax, as other comprehensive earnings (losses) and included as a separate component of stockholders 
equity. 

Impairment of long-lived
assets 

The Company s determination of whether or
not an indication of impairment exists at the cash generating unit level requires significant management judgment pertaining to intangible
assets, including a software copyright of a broadcast game (the Tribal Light ), 55 digital humans and a software copyright
of AI Box, which are used for online living-stream, as well as the operating Right-of-use ROU assets, including the offices
of the Company. Management considers both external and internal sources of information in assessing whether there are any indications
that the Company s intangible assets and ROU assets are impaired. 

Due to limited
potential economic benefits for varying reasons for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized impairment losses
of 2,756,986 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, to the software copyrights. Declines in the value of intangible assets determined
to be OTTI are recognized in earnings and included in other-than-temporary impairment losses. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

In October 2021, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts
with Customers (ASU 2021-08), which clarifies that an acquirer of a business should recognize and measure contract assets and contract
liabilities in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The new amendments are effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments should be applied
prospectively to business combinations occurring on or after the effective date of the amendments, with early adoption permitted. The
Company has evaluated and concluded that there s no impact of the new guidance on the unaudited consolidated financial statements.
The Company adopted ASU 2021-08 since January 1, 2024. 

In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03,
 Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions ,
which clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the
equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The amendments also clarify that an entity cannot, as a separate
unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. This guidance also requires certain disclosures for equity securities
subject to contractual sale restrictions. The new guidance is required to be applied prospectively with any adjustments from the adoption
of the amendments recognized in earnings and disclosed on the date of adoption. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning
after 15 December 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has evaluated and
concluded that there s no impact of the new guidance on the unaudited consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted ASU
2022-03 since January 1, 2024. 

37 

In December 2023, the
FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09), which requires disclosure of
incremental income tax information within the rate reconciliation and expanded disclosures of income taxes paid, among other disclosure
requirements. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company s
management does not believe the adoption of ASU 2023-09 will have a material impact on its financial statements and disclosures. 

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07,
 Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which is intended to improve reportable segment
disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The purpose of the amendment is to
enable investors to better understand an entity s overall performance and assess potential future cash flows. The guidance is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early
adoption permitted. The guidance is to be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company
will begin providing the enhanced reportable segment financial disclosures effective with its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ending December 31, 2024. 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-08,
Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60): Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets, which establishes
accounting guidance for crypto assets meeting certain criteria. Bitcoin meets this criteria. The amendments require crypto assets meeting
the criteria to be recognized at fair value with changes recognized in net income each reporting period. Upon adoption, a cumulative-effect
adjustment is made to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the annual reporting period of adoption. ASU 2023-08
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is
permitted. The Company has evaluated and concluded that there s no impact of the new guidance
on the unaudited consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted ASU 2022-08 since January 1, 2024. 

We do not believe other
recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our consolidated balance
sheets, statements of operations and comprehensive loss and statements of cash flows. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024,
the Company had 31,969 in its operating bank accounts and working capital of approximately 1.2 million. In October 2024, Mr. Xiaojian
Wang, the Chief Executive Officer CEO of the Company, executed a Letter of Support in which he agreed to provide continuing
financial support to the Company for a period of at least 12 months from the issuance date of the Company s unaudited consolidated
financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2024. On September 18, 2024 and September 20, 2024, the CEO lent 9,500 and 50,000,
respectively, to the Company through two loan agreements, for working capital purposes. On October 4, 2024 and October 23, 2024, the CEO
lent 50,000 and 200,000, respectively, to the Company through two loan agreements, for working capital purposes. Pursuant to the loan
agreements, these loans are non-interest bearing and will be due on September 18, 2025, September 20, 2025, October 4, 2025 and October
23, 2025, respectively. Up to the date of the unaudited consolidated financial statements were issued, the Company received 309,500 in
total from the CEO. 

The Company also intends
to raise additional debt or equity capital to fund future operations. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain sufficient
additional funds when needed or that such funds, if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company. In addition, the
Company has planned and implemented cost-cutting measures to reduce operating expenditures and loss. Management believes that the Company
can adjust the pace of its business development and control operating expenses when necessary. Therefore, the Company assesses that current
working capital, together with the letter of financial support from Mr. Xiaojian Wang, will be sufficient to meet its obligations for
the next 12 months from the issuance date of this report. These unaudited consolidated financial statements are prepared on going concern
basis.

The following summarizes
the key components of the Company s cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

As of September 30, 2024
and December 31, 2023, the Company had cash in the amount of 31,969 and 5,175,518, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023, 11,429 and 211,222 were deposited with one financial institution located in the PRC, respectively. As of September 30, 2024
and December 31, 2023, 20,540 and 4,964,296 were deposited with one financial institution located in the United States, respectively. 

Operating activities 

Net cash used in operating activities was approximately
 5.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to approximately 6.5 million net cash used in operating activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 11.5 million, as
compared to approximately 3.7 millions for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used
in operating activities increased by approximately 2.9 million, mainly due to the increase on other-than-temporary impairment losses
from convertible note and intangible assets, partially impairment loss from goodwill. 

Investing activities 

Net cash used in investing
activities was approximately 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to approximately 5.0 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash used in investing activities decreased by approximately 4.3 million, due to no purchase
of intangible assets and no purchase of convertible notes in 2024, partially offset by the loan to a third party. 

Financing activities 

Net cash provided by
financing activities was approximately 0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to approximately 12.7 million
net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash provided by financing activities decreased
by approximately 11.9 million, due to no significant proceeds from issuance of comment stock in 2024.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Credit Risk 

Credit risk is one of the most significant risks for the Company s
business. 

Financial instruments that potentially subject
the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and accounts receivable. Cash held at major financial
institutions located in the PRC are not insured by the government. While we believe that these financial institutions are of high credit
quality, it also continually monitors their credit worthiness. 

Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and
derived from revenue earned from customers, thereby exposed to credit risk. Credit risk is controlled by the application of credit approvals,
limits and monitoring procedures. The Company manages credit risk through in-house research and analysis of the Chinese economy and the
underlying obligors and transaction structures. To minimize credit risk, the Company normally require prepayment from the customers prior
to begin production or delivery products. The Company identifies credit risk collectively based on industry, geography and customer type.
This information is monitored regularly by management. 

In measuring the credit risk of our sales to our
customers, the Company mainly reflects the probability of default by the customer on its contractual obligations and considers
the current financial position of the customer and the exposures to the customer and its likely future development. 

Liquidity Risk 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 31,969
in its operating bank accounts and working capital of approximately 1.2 million. In October 2024, Mr. Xiaojian Wang, the Chief Executive
Officer of the Company( CEO ), executed a Letter of Support in which he agreed to provide continuing financial support to
the Company for a period of at least 12 months from the issuance date of the Company s unaudited consolidated financial statements
for the period ended September 30, 2024. On September 18, 2024 and September 20, 2024, the CEO lent 9,500 and 50,000, respectively,
to the Company through two loan agreements, for working capital purposes. On October 4, 2024 and October 23, 2024, the CEO lent 50,000
and 200,000, respectively, to the Company through two loan agreements, for working capital purposes. Pursuant to the loan agreements,
these loans are non-interest bearing and will be due on September 18, 2025, September 20, 2025, October 4, 2025 and October 23, 2025,
respectively. Up to the date of the unaudited consolidated financial statements were issued, the Company received 309,500 in total from
the CEO. 

The Company also intends to raise additional debt or equity capital
to fund future operations. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain sufficient additional funds when needed or that
such funds, if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company. In addition, the Company has planned and implemented
cost-cutting measures to reduce operating expenditures and loss. Management believes that the Company can adjust the pace of its business
development and control operating expenses when necessary. Therefore, the Company assesses that current working capital, together with
the letter of financial support from Mr. Xiaojian Wang, will be sufficient to meet its obligations for the next 12 months from the issuance
date of this report. These unaudited consolidated financial statements are prepared on going concern basis. 

40 

Inflation Risk 

The Company is also exposed to inflation risk.
Inflationary factors, such as increases in raw material and overhead costs, could impair our operating results. Although we do not believe
that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future
may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and operating expenses as a percentage of sales revenue
if the selling prices of our products do not increase with such increased costs. 

Foreign Currency Risk 

A majority of the Company s operating activities
and a significant portion of the Company s assets and liabilities are denominated in RMB, which is not freely convertible into foreign
currencies. All foreign exchange transactions take place either through the Peoples Bank of China PBOC or other
authorized financial institutions at exchange rates quoted by PBOC. Approval of foreign currency payments by the PBOC or other regulatory
institutions requires submitting a payment application form together with suppliers invoices and signed contracts. The value of
RMB is subject to changes in central government policies and to international economic and political developments affecting supply and
demand in the China Foreign Exchange Trading System market. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief Financial Officer (the Certifying Officers ),
we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. 

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls
and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls
and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Certifying Officers, or
persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal
quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
