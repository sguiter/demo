 million on September 30, 2024. The reserve for unfunded commitments is recognized as a liability (accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial condition), with adjustments to the reserve recognized through provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of income. The reserve for unfunded commitments represents the expected lifetime credit losses on off-balance sheet obligations such as commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. However, a liability is not recognized for commitments that are unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The reserve for unfunded commitments is determined by estimating future draws, including the effects of risk mitigation actions, and applying the expected loss rates on those draws. Loss rates are estimated by utilizing the same loss rates calculated for the allowance for credit losses related to the respective loan portfolio class.

Available for sale investment securities, comprised of debt and mortgage-backed securities, are those that may be sold before maturity due to changes in the Company's interest rate risk profile or funding needs, and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of other comprehensive income. Held-to-maturity investment securities are those that management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported at amortized cost. The Company had held-to-maturity securities at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. Realized gains and losses are recorded in noninterest income and are determined on a trade date basis using the specific identification method. Interest and dividends on investment securities are recognized in interest income on an accrual basis. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted into interest income using the interest method over the expected lives of the individual securities.

As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not intend to sell the investment securities that were in an unrealized loss position. It is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the investment securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity. Available for sale debt securities issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government sponsored enterprises carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government and have a long history of zero credit loss. Municipal bonds are considered to have issuer(s) of high credit quality (rated A or higher) and the decline in fair value is due to changes in interest rates and other market conditions. Corporate securities are non-rated investments that are booked as a debt security where rating agencies do not provide a rating. The absence of a rating does not imply substandard quality. Non-rated corporate securities may be purchased from issuers operating in and around the Company s operating footprint. The issuer(s) continues to make timely principal and interest payments on the bonds. The fair value is expected to recover as the bond(s) approach maturity.

Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability of a borrower to meet his or her obligations and entails both general risks, which are inherent in the process of lending, and risks specific to individual borrowers. Credit risk is mitigated through portfolio diversification, which limits exposure to any single customer, industry, or collateral type. Residential mortgage and home equity loans and lines generally have the lowest credit loss experience. Loans secured by personal property, such as auto loans, generally experience medium credit losses. Unsecured loan products, such as personal revolving credit, have the highest credit loss experience and for that reason, the Bank has chosen not to engage in a significant amount of this type of lending. Credit risk in commercial lending can vary significantly, as losses as a percentage of outstanding loans can shift widely during economic cycles and are particularly sensitive to changing economic conditions. Generally, improving economic conditions result in improved operating results on the part of commercial customers, enhancing their ability to meet their particular debt service requirements. Improvements, if any, in operating cash flows can be offset by the impact of rising interest rates that may occur during improved economic times. Inconsistent economic conditions may have an adverse effect on the operating results of commercial customers, reducing their ability to meet debt service obligations.

The Company had no real estate acquired in partial or total satisfaction of debt at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. All such properties are initially recorded at a lower of cost or fair value (net realizable value) at the date acquired and carried on the balance sheet as other real estate owned. Losses arising at the date of acquisition are charged against the allowance for credit losses. Subsequent write-downs that may be required and the expense of operation are included in noninterest expense. Gains and losses realized from the sale of other real estate owned were included in noninterest income. Credit Quality Information In addition to monitoring the performance status of the loan portfolio, the Company utilizes a risk rating scale (1-8) to evaluate loan asset quality for all loans. Loans that are rated 1-4 are classified as pass credits. For the pass-rated loans, management believes there is a low risk of loss related to these loans and, as necessary, credit may be strengthened through improved borrower performance and/or additional collateral. The Bank s internal risk ratings are as follows: 1 4 (Pass) - Pass credits are loans in grades superior through acceptable . These are at least considered to be credits with acceptable risks and would be granted in the normal course of lending operations. 5 (Special Mention) - Special mention credits have potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the credits or in the Bank s credit position at some future date. If weaknesses cannot be identified, classification as special mention is not appropriate. Special mention credits are not adversely classified and do not expose the Bank to sufficient risk to warrant an adverse classification. No apparent loss of principal or interest is expected. 6 (Substandard) - Substandard credits are inadequately protected by the current worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by the collateral pledged. Financial statements normally reveal some or all of the following: poor trends, lack of earnings and cash flow, excessive debt, lack of liquidity, and the absence of creditor protection. Credits so classified must have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 7 (Doubtful) - A doubtful credit has all the weaknesses inherent in a substandard asset with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions,

 with of specific reserves as of September 30, 2024. These assets included single-family residential, commercial and industrial, and automobile loans. They have been classified as impaired and include nonaccrual, past due 90 days or more and still accruing, and a homogeneous pool of indirect loans all considered to be impaired loans, which are valued under Level 3 inputs. Foreclosed real estate assets are primarily valued on a nonrecurring basis at the fair values of the underlying real estate collateral. The Company is predominantly a cash flow lender with real estate serving as collateral on a majority of loans. On a quarterly basis, the Company determines such fair values through a variety of data points and mostly relies on appraisals from independent appraisers. We obtain an appraisal of properties when they become impaired and conduct new appraisals at least every year. Typically, these appraisals do not include an inside inspection of the property as our loan documents do not require the borrower to allow access to the property. Therefore, the most significant unobservable inputs are the details of the amenities included within the property and the condition of the property. Further, we cannot always accurately assess the amount of time it takes to gain ownership of our collateral through the foreclosure process and the damage, as well as potential looting, of the property further decreasing our value. Thus, in determining the fair values we discount the current independent appraisals, within a range of to , based on individual circumstances.

Loans receivable, net Cash value of life insurance Financial instruments - Liabilities Deposits Short-term debt Fair values are based on quoted market prices for similar instruments or estimated using discounted cash flows. The discounts used are estimated using comparable market rates for similar types of instruments adjusted to be commensurate with the credit risk, overhead costs, and optionality of such instruments. The fair value of cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, investments in restricted stocks and accrued interest receivable are equal to the carrying amounts. The fair values of investment securities are determined using market quotations, if available, or measured using pricing models or other model-based valuation techniques such as present value and future value cash flows. The fair value of loans receivable is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis. For cash surrender value of life insurance, the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value. The cash surrender value of life insurance is reported in the Level 2 fair value category. The fair value of the Bank Term Funding Program loans is equal to the carrying amounts. The fair value of FHLB borrowings is estimated based upon discounted future cash flows using a discounted rate comparable to the current market rate for such borrowings. FHLB borrowings are reported in the Level 2 fair value category.

OVERVIEW Glen Burnie Bancorp, a Maryland corporation (the Company ), through its subsidiary, The Bank of Glen Burnie, a Maryland banking corporation (the Bank ), operates a commercial bank with eight offices in Anne Arundel County Maryland. The Company reported a net loss of 72,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to net income of 1.3 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily the result of a 460,000 decrease in interest and dividends on securities, a 1.0 million increase in interest expense on short-term borrowings, a 1.4 million increase in interest expense on deposits and a 780,000 increase in the provision for credit losses on loans, partially offset by an increase of 1.3 million in loan interest income and fees, a 535,000 increase in interest on deposits with banks, and a 569,000 decrease in the provision for income taxes. The increase in interest expense on deposits was driven by the higher rate and balances in money market deposits. The increase in interest on borrowings was driven by an increase in short-term borrowings due to the elevated level of deposit runoff in 2023. The higher interest expense was partially offset by the increase in loan interest income due to higher yields on loans for the first nine months of 2024 and resulted in a decrease in net interest income of 1.1 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, versus the same period last year. Total interest income increased 1.4 million to 11.3 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. This resulted primarily from a 0.72 increase in the yield on loans and a 7.4 million increase in average total loan balances. Total assets increased to 368.4 million on September 30, 2024, an increase of 16.5 million from December 31, 2023. Cash and cash equivalents increased by 7.2 million or 47.38 , during the first nine months of 2024. The Bank s loan portfolio increased by 30.7 million or 17.39 and investment securities available for sale declined by 19.5 million or 13.96 over the same period. The Company s allowance for credit losses was 2.75 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 2.16 million at December 31, 2023, an increase of 591,000 or 27.40 . Total deposits increased 14.2 million, or 4.73 , during the first nine months of 2024 and short-term borrowings were unchanged at 30.0 million on September 30, 2024 and at year end 2023. Shareholder s equity was 21.2 million on September 30, 2024, a 1.8 million or 9.50 increase, as compared to 19.3 million on December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to unrealized losses, net of taxes, on securities available for sale amounting to 15.7 million on September 30, 2024, compared to 18.4 million at December 31, 2023. The Company has strong liquidity and capital positions that provide ample capacity for future growth. The Bank s total regulatory capital to risk weighted assets were 16.72 on September 30, 2024, as compared to 18.40 on December 31, 2023. Return on average assets for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, was 0.14 and (0.03) compared to 0.61 and 0.46 for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Lower net income and a higher average asset balance primarily drove the lower return on average assets for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same periods in 2023. Return on average

 equity for the three- and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, was 2.63 and (0.52 compared to 12.47 and 9.34 for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Lower net income and a higher average equity balance primarily drove the lower return on average equity for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. The book value per share of Bancorp s common stock was 7.29 on September 30, 2024, as compared to 4.57 per share on September 30, 2023. The increase primarily resulted from the lower unrealized losses on the Company s available for sale securities of 15.7 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 24.6 million at September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the Bank remained above all well-capitalized regulatory requirement levels. The Bank s tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 15.47 at September 30, 2024, compared to 17.37 at December 31, 2023. Our liquidity position remained strong due to managed cash and cash equivalents, borrowing lines with the Federal Reserve Bank, the FHLB of Atlanta and correspondent banks, and the size and composition of the bond portfolio. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net income attributable to common stockholders for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, was 129,000, or 0.04 per basic and diluted common share compared to net income of 551,000, or 0.19 per basic and diluted common share for the same period of 2023. The results for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, were lower than the same period of 2023 resulting primarily from a 614,000 increase in interest expense on deposits and a 126,000 increase in interest expense on short-term borrowings, a 287,000 decrease in interest and dividends on securities, a 170,000 increase in the provision for credit losses on loans and a 197,000 increase in noninterest expenses. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of 763,000 in loan interest income and fees, and a 133,000 increase in interest on deposits with banks. The Company s need to defend its deposit base as well as grow interest-earning asset balances necessitated a strategic change in direction that resulted in the increased interest expense. Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, was 72,000, as compared to net income of 1.3 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily the result of a 460,000 decrease in interest and dividends on securities, a 1.0 million increase in interest expense on short-term borrowings, a 1.4 million increase in interest expense on deposits and a 780,000 increase in the provision for credit losses on loans, partially offset by an increase of 1.3 million in loan interest income and fees, a 535,000 increase in interest on deposits with banks and a 569,000 decrease in the provision for income taxes. Net Interest Income . The Company s net interest income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 2.8 million, as compared to 3.0 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 131,000, or 4.44 . The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to a 740,000 increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits and borrowings driven by a 17.3 million increase in the average balance of interest-bearing funds and a 16.6 million decrease in the average balance of noninterest-bearing deposits. The higher expenses were partially offset by a 609,000 increase in total interest income due to a 0.66 increase in the yield on interest earning assets. Net interest income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, totaled 8.2 million, a decrease of 1.1 million from the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest income was due to a 2.4 million increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits and borrowings driven by a 17.3 million increase in the average balance of interest-bearing funds and a 20.0 million decrease in the average balance of noninterest-bearing deposits. The higher expenses were partially offset by a 1.3 million increase in total interest income due to a 0.51 increase in the yield of interest earning assets. Total interest income for the third quarter of 2024 increased 609,000, or 18.18 when compared to the same period in 2023, from 3.4 million in 2023 to 4.0 million in 2024. The primary driver of the increase was a 763,000, or 35.57 , increase in interest and fees on loans due to higher rates and higher average balance of total loans, along with a 133,000, or 127.88 , increase in interest on deposits with banks and federal funds that were partially offset by a 287,000, or 26.07 , decrease in interest and dividends on investment securities due to maturities.

 Total interest income increased 1.4 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023 from 9.9 million in 2023 to 11.3 million, an increase of 13.68 . The primary driver of the increase was an increase of 1.3 million, or 20.10 , increase in interest and fees on loans due to higher rates and higher average balance of total loans and 535,000, or 114.07 , increase in interest on deposits with banks and federal funds that were partially offset by a 460,000, or 15.01 , decrease in interest and dividends on investment securities due to maturities. Interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 increased 740,000 from 398,000 for the same period in 2023 to 1.1 million, an increase of 185.93 . The increase was attributable to higher balances and rates on money market deposits and a higher average balance of short-term borrowings for the third quarter of 2024. Interest expense increased 2.4 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, from 657,000 for the same period in 2023 to 3.1 million, an increase of 368.65 . Net interest margin for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 3.06 compared to 3.21 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 0.15 . Higher average interest-bearing funds, lower average noninterest-bearing funds, and higher cost of funds, partially offset by higher average yields and balances on interest-earning assets were the primary drivers of year-over-year results. The average balance of interest-bearing funds and noninterest-bearing funds increased 17.3 million and decreased 16.6 million, respectively, and the cost of funds increased 0.86 , when comparing the three-month periods ending September 30, 2023, and 2024. The average balance of interest-earning assets increased 0.8 million while the yield increased 0.66 from 3.64 to 4.30 , when comparing the three-month periods ending September 30, 2023, and 2024, respectively. Net interest margin for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, was 2.98 , compared to 3.35 for the same period of 2023. Higher average interest-bearing funds, lower average noninterest-bearing funds, and higher cost of funds, partially offset by higher average yields on interest-earning assets, were the primary drivers of year-over-year results. The average balance of interest-bearing funds and noninterest-bearing funds increased 17.3 million and decreased 20.0 million, respectively, and the cost of funds increased 0.94 , when comparing the nine-month periods ending September 30, 2023, and 2024. The average balance of interest-earning assets decreased 2.7 million, while the yield increased 0.51 from 3.59 to 4.10 , when comparing the nine-month periods ending September 30, 2023, and 2024, respectively. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits in banks and investment securities decreased 25.3 million from 188.2 million to 162.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to the same period of 2023, while the yield remained unchanged during that same period. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits in banks and investment securities decreased 10.1 million from 187.9 million to 177.8 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same period of 2023, while the yield increased 0.20 from 2.51 to 2.71 during that same period. The increase in yields is attributed to the higher interest rate environment and its positive impact on cash balances and investment yields. Average total loan balances increased 26.1 million to 203.3 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 177.2 million for the same period of 2023, while the yield increased 0.89 from 4.80 to 5.69 during that same period. The increase in loan yields for the third quarter of 2024 reflected the runoff of the lower yielding loans and the origination of higher yielding loans in the current higher rate environment. Average total loan balances increased 7.4 million to 188.6 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 181.2 million for the same period of 2023, while the yield increased 0.72 from 4.70 to 5.42 during that same period. The increase in loan yields for the first nine months of 2024 reflected the runoff of the lower yielding loans and origination of higher yielding loans in the current higher rate environment. The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, information regarding the average balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the amount of interest income and interest expense and the resulting yields on average interest-earning assets and rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities.

 Provision for Credit Losses on Loans . The Company recognized a provision of 78,000 compared to a release of allowance for credit losses of 92,000 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The increase for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflects a 32 million increase in the reservable balance of the loan portfolio and a 0.13 increase in the current expected credit loss percentage. The Company recognized a provision of allowance for credit losses on loans in the amount of 773,000 compared to a release of allowance for credit loss of 7,000 for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As a result, the allowance for credit loss on loans was 2.75 million on September 30, 2024, representing 1.33 of total loans, compared to 2.09 million, or 1.20 of total loans on September 30, 2023. Noninterest Income . Noninterest income increased to 354,000 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, from 315,000 for the corresponding period in 2023, an increase of 39,000, or 12.38 . Noninterest income increased 25,000 to 825,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, from 800,000 for the corresponding period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in other fees and commissions. Noninterest Expenses . Noninterest expenses for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 3.02 million and 2.82 million, respectively, an increase of 197,000, or 6.98 . The primary contributors to the increase, when compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, were increases in legal, accounting, and other professional fees, data processing and item processing services, advertising and marketing related expenses, and other expenses (primarily allowance for unfunded commitments), partially offset by decreases in salary and employee benefits. Noninterest expenses increased from 8.7 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 8.8 million for the corresponding period in 2024, an 81,000 or 0.94 increase. The primary contributors when comparing to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, were increases in occupancy and equipment expenses, legal, accounting, and other professional fees, advertising and marketing related expenses, and other expenses (primarily allowance for unfunded commitments), partially offset by decreases in salary and employee benefits costs. Income Taxes . During the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of 50,000 compared to a benefit of 13,000 for the same period in 2023, a 37,000, or 284.62 increase. The current quarter s income tax benefit includes forecasted tax benefit of 37,000 for the current period loss. The current period benefit is the result of pre-tax loss containing a lower proportion of taxable income compared to the pre-tax income for the prior year period. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded income tax benefit of 470,000 compared to 99,000 expense for the same period in 2023, a 569,000, or 574.75 decrease. The year-to-date income tax benefit includes forecasted tax benefit of 383,000 for the current period loss and 87,000 associated with amended Maryland tax returns for tax years 2022 and 2021. The tax benefit for year-to-date September 30, 2024 is the result of pre-tax loss containing a lower proportion of taxable income compared to the pre-tax income for the prior year period. Comprehensive Income (Loss). In accordance with regulatory requirements, the Company reports comprehensive income (loss) in its financial statements. Comprehensive income (loss) consists of the Company s net income, adjusted for unrealized gains and losses on the Bank s portfolio of investment securities. For the third quarter of 2024, the comprehensive income, net of tax, totaled 3.9 million compared to comprehensive loss in the amount of 3.8 million for the same period in 2023. The 7.8 million increase in comprehensive income was due to an 8.2 million decrease in unrealized losses on securities for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the amount of unrealized losses on securities for the comparable prior year period which was partially offset by the 422,000 decrease in net income for the third quarter of 2024 versus the same period of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, comprehensive income, net of tax, totaled 2.6 million compared to comprehensive loss, net of tax, in the amount of 2.1 million for the comparable period in 2023. The 4.7 million increase in comprehensive income for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 versus the comparable period in 2023, was attributable to the 6.1 million decrease in the amount of unrealized loss on securities and the 1.3 million decline in net income for the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period.

 FINANCIAL CONDITION General . The Company s assets increased to 368.4 million at September 30, 2024 from 351.8 million at December 31, 2023, an increase of 16.5 million or 4.70 , primarily due to a 7.2 million increase in cash and cash equivalents, a 19.5 million decrease in investment securities available for sale, and a 30.1 million increase in loans, net. Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, totaled 22.5 million, an increase of 7.2 million, or 47.38 from 15.2 million on December 31, 2023. Investment securities available for sale as of September 30, 2024, totaled 120.0 million, a decrease of 19.5 million, or 13.96 from 139.4 million on December 31, 2023. Loans, net totaled 204.2 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 30.1 million or 17.27 , from 174.2 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in construction, single-family residential, commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans partially offset by decreases in automobile loans. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when they are past due 90 days as to either principal or interest or when, in the opinion of management, the collection of all interest and/or principal is in doubt. Placing a loan on nonaccrual status means that we no longer accrue interest or amortize deferred fees or costs on such loans and reverse any interest previously accrued but not collected. Management may grant a waiver from nonaccrual status for a 90 day past due loan that is both well secured and in the process of collection. A loan remains on nonaccrual status until the loan is current as to payment of both principal and interest and the borrower has demonstrated the ability to make payments in accordance with the terms of the loan and remain current. A loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans are measured based on the fair value of the collateral for collateral dependent loans and at the present value of expected future cash flows using the loans effective interest rates for loans that are not collateral dependent. At September 30, 2024, impaired loans totaled 0.3 million, net of specific reserves. Included in the impaired loans total was 0.3 million in loans classified as nonaccrual loans. At September 30, 2024, impaired loans included restructured loans to borrowers with financial difficulty totaling 27,000. Borrowers under all other restructured loans are paying in accordance with the terms of the modified loan agreement and have been placed on accrual status after a period of performance with the restructured terms. The following table presents details of our nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets, as these asset quality metrics are evaluated by management, at the dates indicated:

For leases where the Bank is the lessee, operating leases are included in premises and equipment, net, and accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Bank currently does not have any finance leases. Operating lease Right-of-Use ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. ROU assets also include any initial direct costs incurred and any lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, less lease incentives received. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the lease liabilities as the Company s leases generally do not provide an implicit rate. Lease terms may include options to extend or to terminate when the Company is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Future minimum payments of the Bank s operating leases as of September 30, 2024 are as follows:

The Bank has a defined contribution retirement plan qualifying under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code that is funded through a profit sharing agreement and voluntary employee contributions. The plan provides for discretionary employer matching contributions to be determined annually by the Board of Directors. The plan covers substantially all employees. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Bank accrued 207,000 for its projected 401(k) match contribution as well as other profit sharing benefits.

 MARKET RISK AND INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY Our primary market risk is interest rate fluctuation. Interest rate risk results primarily from the traditional banking activities in which the Bank engages, such as gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates and consumer preferences affect the difference between the interest earned on our assets and the interest paid on liabilities. Our interest rate risk represents the level of exposure we have to fluctuations in interest rates and is primarily measured as the change in earnings and the theoretical market value of equity that results from changes in interest rates. The Asset Liability Committee ALCO oversees our management of interest rate risk. The objective of the management of interest rate risk is to maximize stockholder value, enhance profitability and increase capital, serve customer and community needs, and protect the Company from any adverse material financial consequences associated with changes in interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is that risk to earnings or capital arising from movement of interest rates. It arises from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows (repricing risk); from changing rate relationships across yield curves that affect bank activities (basis risk); from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities (yield curve risk); and from interest rate related options embedded in certain bank products (option risk). Changes in interest rates may also affect a bank s underlying economic value. The value of a bank s assets, liabilities, and interest-rate related, off-balance sheet contracts are affected by a change in rates because they represent the value of future cash flows, and in some cases the cash flows themselves, is changed. We believe that accepting some level of interest rate risk is necessary in order to achieve realistic profit goals. Management and the Board of Directors have chosen an interest rate risk profile that is consistent with our strategic business plan. The Company s Board of Directors has established a comprehensive interest rate risk management policy, which is administered by our ALCO. The policy establishes limits on risk, which are quantitative measures of the percentage change in net interest income (a measure of net interest income at risk) and the fair value of equity capital (a measure of economic value of equity or EVE at risk) resulting from a hypothetical change in U.S. Treasury interest rates. We measure the potential adverse impacts that changing interest rates may have on our short-term earnings, long-term value, and liquidity by employing simulation analysis through the use of computer modeling. The simulation model captures optionality factors such as call features and interest rate caps and floors embedded in investment and loan portfolio contracts. As with any method of gauging interest rate risk, there are certain shortcomings inherent in the interest rate modeling methodology we employ. When interest rates change, actual movements in different categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, loan prepayments, and withdrawals of time and other deposits, may deviate significantly from assumptions used in the model. Finally, the methodology does not measure or reflect the impact that higher rates may have on adjustable-rate loan customers ability to service their debts, or the impact of rate changes on demand for loan and deposit products. We prepare a current base case and alternative simulations at least once a quarter and report the analysis to the ALCO and Board of Directors. In addition, more frequent forecasts are produced when the direction or degree of change in interest rates are particularly uncertain to evaluate the impact of balance sheet strategies or when other business conditions so dictate. The statement of condition is subject to quarterly testing for alternative interest rate shock possibilities to indicate the inherent interest rate risk. Average interest rates are shocked by +/ - 100, 200, 300, and 400 basis points bp ), although we may elect not to use particular scenarios that we determine are impractical in the current rate environment. It is our goal to structure the balance sheet so that net interest-earnings at risk over a 12-month period and the economic value of equity at risk do not exceed policy guidelines at the various interest rate shock levels. At September 30, 2024, the simulation analysis indicated that the Bank is in an asset sensitive position in all falling rate scenarios and the +100 bp and +200 bp shock scenarios, but is slightly liability sensitive in the +300, and +400 bp shock scenarios. Overall, rising rate scenarios indicate a fairly balanced profile. Management strives to optimize the level of higher costing fixed rate funding instruments, while seeking to increase assets that are more fluid in their repricing. An asset sensitive position, theoretically, is favorable in a rising rate environment since more assets than

 liabilities will re-price in a given time frame as interest rates rise. Similarly, a liability sensitive position, theoretically, is favorable in a declining interest rate environment since more liabilities than assets will re-price in a given time frame as interest rates decline. Management works to maintain a consistent spread between yields on assets and costs of deposits and borrowings, regardless of the direction of interest rates. The foregoing analysis assumes that the Company s assets and liabilities move with rates at their earliest repricing opportunities based on final maturity, while considering optionality such as call features, where applicable. Certificates of deposit and IRA accounts are presumed to be repriced at maturity. NOW and savings accounts are assumed to be repriced within three months although it is the Company s experience that such accounts may be less sensitive to changes in market rates.

 In an increasing interest rate environment, the Company s interest income changes at a rate consistent with changes in its total interest expense, thereby resulting in a balanced profile, with net interest income exhibiting minor changes in rising rate scenarios. Conversely, in a declining interest rate environment the decreases in the Company s interest income will be greater than decreases in its already low interest expense, thereby resulting in lower net interest income. In a rising interest rate environment, the Company is positioned to generate less economic value of equity as the duration of the assets is longer than the duration of the liabilities, with liabilities repricing more quickly than our assets. Conversely, the Company s economic value of equity increases in a falling interest rate environment as the longer duration of the assets benefits the Company in falling rate scenarios. Thus, the economic value of equity increases. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company currently has no business other than that of the Bank and does not currently have any material funding commitments. The Company s principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and dividends received from the Bank. The Bank is subject to various regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends. The Bank s principal sources of funds for investments and operations are net income, deposits from its primary market area, principal and interest payments on loans, interest received on investment securities and proceeds from maturing investment securities. Its principal funding commitments are for the origination or purchase of loans and the payment of maturing deposits. Deposits are considered a primary source of funds supporting the Bank s lending and investment activities. The Bank s most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, which are cash on hand, amounts due from financial institutions, federal funds sold, certificates of deposit with other financial institutions that have an original maturity of three months or less and money market mutual funds. The levels of such assets are dependent on the Bank s operating, financing, and investment activities at any given time. The variations in levels of cash and cash equivalents are influenced by deposit flows and anticipated future deposit flows. The Bank s cash and cash equivalents (cash due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions, and federal funds sold), as of September 30, 2024, totaled 22.5 million, an increase of 7.2 million, or 47.38 from 15.2 million at December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank was permitted to draw on a 88.9 million line of credit from the FHLB of Atlanta. Short-term borrowings under the line totaled 0 and 20.0 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Borrowings under the line are secured by a floating lien on the Bank s residential mortgage loans and investment securities. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank had 30.0 million in outstanding short-term borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank FRB under the Bank Term Funding Program BTFP ). At December 31, 2023, there was 10.0 million in short-term borrowings outstanding from the FRB. Borrowings under the line are secured by investment securities. As of September 30, 2024, no further advances are available under the BTFP as that program has been terminated by the FRB. The Bank also has a line of credit through the Federal Reserve Discount Window that is limited to the amount of qualifying collateral pledged, for which the amount outstanding at September 30, 2024, totaled 0. In addition, the Bank has two unsecured federal funds lines of credit in the amount of 9.0 million and 8.0 million, respectively, of which 0 was outstanding as of September 30, 2024. The Company s stockholders equity increased 1.8 million, or 9.50 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. The increase in equity was primarily due to a 2.7 million decrease in the after-tax net unrealized holding loss on securities available for sale that was partially offset by the 866,000 in dividends paid and the 72,000 net loss in the period ended September 30, 2024.

 The Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have established guidelines with respect to the maintenance of appropriate levels of capital by bank holding companies and state non-member banks, respectively. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial condition. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank s capital amounts, and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. The Bank is subject to the Basel III Capital Rules. The Basel III Capital Rules define the components of capital and address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions regulatory capital ratios. The Basel III Capital Rules also address risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in banking institutions regulatory capital ratios and replace the existing risk-weighting approach with a more risk-sensitive approach. The Basel III Capital Rules also implements the requirements of Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies rules. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s financial statements. The Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting principles. The Bank s capital amounts, and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. The rules include a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets minimum ratio of 4.5 , a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4.0 to 6.0 , require a minimum ratio of Total Capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0 , and require a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0 . The rules establish a capital conservation buffer above the regulatory minimum capital requirements. Since 2019, this capital conservation buffer is 2.5 . The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress and as detailed above, effectively increases the minimum required risk-weighted capital ratios. The rules also implemented strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments. The rules also revised the definition and calculation of Tier 1 capital, Total Capital, and risk-weighted assets. The Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios are calculated by dividing the respective capital amounts by risk-weighted assets. Risk-weighted assets are calculated based on regulatory requirements and include total assets, with certain exclusions, allocated by risk weight category, and certain off-balance-sheet items, among other things. The leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by adjusted quarterly average total assets, which exclude goodwill and other intangible assets, among other things.

 The regulations impose several sets of capital adequacy requirements: minimum leverage rules, which require bank holding companies and banks to maintain a specified minimum ratio of capital to total assets, and risk-based capital rules, which require the maintenance of specified minimum ratios of capital to risk-weighted assets. In addition, there are requirements to maintain a capital conservation buffer which raised the minimum required common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to 7.00 , the Tier 1 capital ratio to 8.50 and the total capital ratio to 10.50 . At September 30, 2024, the Bank was in full compliance with these guidelines with a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 10.11 , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 15.47 , a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 15.47 , and a total risk-based capital ratio of 16.72 . The Company s capital amounts and ratios at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows:

As discussed there, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Since future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Management has used the best information available to make the estimations necessary to value the related assets and liabilities based on historical experience and on various assumptions which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. The Company reevaluates these variables as facts and circumstances change. Historically, actual results have not differed significantly from the Company s estimates. The following is a summary of the more judgmental accounting estimates and principles involved in the preparation of the Company s financial statements, including the identification of the variables most important in the estimation process: Allowance for Credit Losses. The allowance for credit losses ACL consists of the allowance for credit losses and the reserve for unfunded commitments. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses ASC 326 ). The ASC, as amended, is intended to provide financial statement users with more decision useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments that are not accounted for at fair value through net income. As a result of our adoption of ASC 326, our methodology for estimating the ACL changed significantly from December 31, 2020. The standard replaced the incurred loss approach with an expected loss approach known as current expected credit loss CECL ). The CECL methodology requires an estimate of the credit losses expected over 

 - 40 - 

Table of Contents 
 the life of an exposure (or pool of exposures) and it removes the incurred loss methodology s threshold that delayed the recognition of a credit loss until it was probable a loss event was deemed to be incurred. The estimate of expected credit losses under the CECL methodology is based on relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts. Historical loss experience is generally the starting point for estimating expected credit losses. We then consider whether the historical loss experience should be adjusted for asset-specific risk characteristics or current conditions at the reporting date that did not exist over the period from which historical experience was based. Finally, we consider forecasts about future economic conditions or changes in collateral values that are reasonable and supportable. Management s determination of the amount of the ACL is a critical accounting estimate as it requires significant reliance on the credit risk we ascribe to individual borrowers, the use of estimates and significant judgment as to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on criticized loans, significant reliance on historical loss rates on homogenous portfolios, consideration of our quantitative and qualitative evaluation of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts. Going forward, the impact of utilizing the CECL methodology to calculate the ACL will be significantly influenced by the composition, characteristics, and quality of our loan portfolio, as well as the prevailing economic conditions and forecasts utilized. Material changes to these and other relevant factors may result in greater volatility to the allowance for credit losses, and therefore, greater volatility in our reported earnings. For further information regarding the Bank s allowance for credit losses, see Allowance for Credit Losses, above.
