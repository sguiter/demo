The staff of the CPSC recommended a fine against Mr. Walbrecht personally. Pursuant to the Company s by-laws, the Company has agreed to indemnify Mr. Walbrecht and pay his legal fees, and he has provided an undertaking to the Company that the Company will be entitled to recover those expenses if it is ultimately determined that he was not entitled to indemnification. On August 26, 2024, Mr. Walbrecht s independent counsel responded to the CPSC, denying the allegations of its June 25 letter and rejecting its demand for a penalty. Based on currently available information, the Company believes an unfavorable outcome with the CPSC is probable, however, we cannot reasonably estimate on what terms this matter will be resolved. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a liability of representing the low end of the range of our estimated exposure. The Company does not have a better estimate of the loss; therefore the low-end of the range was recorded as an

 in U.S. net deferred tax assets. These deferred tax assets are expected to reverse into NOL carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable in future periods. At this time, we consider it more likely than not that we will have sufficient taxable income in future periods that will allow us to realize these deferred tax assets. However, unless we can generate sufficient taxable income from our future operations, a valuation allowance to reduce our U.S. deferred tax assets may be required, which would materially increase our income tax expense in the period the allowance is recognized and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and consolidated financial position.

 On August 6, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend program of 0.025 per share of the Company s common stock (the Quarterly Cash Dividend or 0.10 per share on an annualized basis. The declaration and payment of future Quarterly Cash Dividends is subject to the discretion of and approval of the Company s Board of Directors. On November 6, 2024, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved the payment on November 27, 2024 of the Quarterly Cash Dividend of 0.025 to the record holders of shares of the Company s common stock as of the close of business on November 18, 2024. Restructuring Starting in 2023, the Company began incurring expenses to facilitate long-term sustainable growth through cost reduction actions, consisting of employee reductions, facility rationalization and contract termination costs. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred 478 and 1,076, respectively, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred 1,009 and 1,812, respectively, of restructuring charges related to these actions. The Company has incurred 4,232 of cumulative restructuring charges since the commencement of restructuring actions in 2023. The Company accrues for restructuring costs when they are probable and reasonably estimable. These costs include severance costs, exit costs, and other restructuring costs and are included in restructuring charges in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Severance costs primarily consist of severance benefits through payroll continuation, conditional separation costs and employer tax liabilities, while exit costs primarily consist of lease exit and contract termination costs. Other costs consist primarily of costs related to the discontinuance of certain product lines and are distinguishable and directly attributable to the Company s restructuring initiative and not a result of external market factors associated with the ongoing business. We estimate that we will continue to incur restructuring costs related to employee-related costs and facility exit costs during the year 2024; however, the Company cannot estimate the total amount expected to be incurred as cost reduction actions continue to be evaluated. The Company anticipates completing these restructuring activities in 2025. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates Management s discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based on the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Estimates also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Our critical accounting policies that require the use of estimates and assumptions were discussed in detail in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates. No impairments were recorded for goodwill or intangible assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. However, factors such as a sustained decline in revenues and cash flows, or other adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions, including our current and future share price, could result in an impairment charge to our Adventure reporting unit in a future reporting period. The Company performs its annual impairment assessment during the fourth quarter of 2024. At this time, we consider it more likely than not that we will have sufficient taxable income in future periods that will allow us to realize our deferred tax assets. However, unless we can generate sufficient taxable income from our future operations, a valuation allowance to reduce our U.S. deferred tax assets may be required, which would materially increase our income tax expense in the period the allowance is recognized and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and consolidated financial position. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The decrease in sales was attributable to a decrease in sales at the Outdoor and Adventure segments of 11,789 and 2,398, respectively. Sales in the Adventure segment increased by 281 due to foreign exchange impact from the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Australian dollar during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior period. Sales in the Outdoor segment were reduced by 13 due to foreign exchange impact from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar primarily against the euro during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior period. Sales in the Outdoor segment decreased due to weakness in our North American wholesale and direct to consumer DTC channels, independent global distributor IGD customers, and softness in our European markets, combined with the effects from our product simplification and SKU rationalization strategy. Sales in the Adventure segment decreased due to lower demand from original equipment manufacturer OEM customers and challenging wholesale in the Australia and US markets, partially offset by a 1,237 increase from the TRED Outdoors acquisition. Domestic sales decreased 6,058, or 19.9 , to 24,365 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to domestic sales of 30,423 during the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Gross margin during the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased compared to the prior year as a result of favorable product mix at the Outdoor segment, as well as a favorable channel mix due to lower OEM sales and higher MAXTRAX revenue at the Adventure segment. These increases were partially offset by an increase in polyfluoroalkyl substances PFAS related inventory reserve expenses at the Outdoor segment, as well as sales return reserve and rebate expenses at the Adventure segment. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased 524, or 1.8 , to 27,880 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to selling, general and administrative expenses of 28,404 during the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Selling, general and administrative expenses at the Outdoor segment decreased by 4,850 primarily as a result of lower retail expenses due to store closures and other expense reduction initiatives to manage costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses at the Adventure segment increased by 3,753 primarily as a result of investments in global marketing, e-commerce initiatives, and organizational leadership to accelerate growth. Restructuring Charges Restructuring charges decreased to 1,009 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to restructuring charges of 1,812 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The restructuring charges incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 relate to benefits provided to employees who were terminated due to the Company s reduction-in-force as part of its continued realignment of resources within the organization of 993 and lease exit and contract termination costs of 16.

 Transaction Costs Transaction costs decreased to 168 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to transaction costs of 459 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which consisted of expenses related to the Company s various acquisition efforts. Contingent Consideration Benefit Contingent consideration benefit decreased to 125 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a contingent consideration benefit of 1,565 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which consisted of changes in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration liabilities associated with our acquisitions of MAXTRAX in 2021 and TRED in 2023. Legal Costs and Regulatory Matter Expenses Legal costs and regulatory matter expenses increased to 3,795 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to legal costs and regulatory matter expenses of 1,062 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in legal costs and regulatory matter expenses recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflects the Company s accrued liability for the outstanding regulatory matter with the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission and increased expenses related to the Company s specific legal matters. See Note 16 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for financial information regarding specific legal matters. Interest Income, net Interest income, net increased to 1,198 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to interest income, net of 32 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest income recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was due to interest income on higher cash balances. Other, net Other, net, changed by 812, or 567.8 , to 669 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to other, net of 143) during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in other, net, was primarily attributable to a decrease in remeasurement losses recognized on the Company s foreign denominated accounts receivable and accounts payable. The change was partially offset by a reduction in gains in mark-to-market adjustments on non-hedged foreign currency contracts during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Income Taxes Income tax benefit increased by 699, or 27.0 , to 3,290 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2,591 during the same period in 2023. Our effective income tax rate was a benefit of 17.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and differed compared to the statutory tax rates primarily due to the impact of stock compensation and research and experimentation expenditures and credits. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our effective income tax rate was a benefit of 23.2 and differed compared to the statutory tax rates due to the impact of stock compensation, research and experimentation expenditures and credits, and discrete stock option windfall benefits. Discontinued Operations Net income from discontinued operations changed by 21,544, to 28,346 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income from discontinued operations of 6,802 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in net income from discontinued operations was primarily attributable to the pre-tax gain on the sale of the

 Precision Sport segment of 40,585. There was no activity in discontinued operations during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Liquidity and Capital Resources Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Our primary ongoing funding requirements are for working capital, expansion of our operations (both organically and through acquisitions) and general corporate needs, as well as investing in the various brands. We plan to fund these activities through a combination of our future operating cash flows and cash on hand. Upon the closing of the sale of the Precision Sport segment, the Company terminated and settled all outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility and term debt under the Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and the lenders party thereto (the Restated Credit Agreement ). We believe that our liquidity requirements and contractual obligations for at least the next 12 months will be adequately covered by cash provided by operations and cash on hand. Additionally, long-term contractual obligations are currently expected to be funded from cash from operations and cash on hand. At September 30, 2024, we had total cash of 36,399, compared to total cash of 11,324 at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 5,109 of the 36,399 in cash held by foreign entities, of which 3,819 is considered permanently reinvested. The following presents a discussion of cash flows for the condensed consolidated nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the condensed consolidated nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities (23,870) 17,428 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 171,144 (4,549) Net cash used in financing activities (122,281) (16,191) Effect of foreign exchange rates on cash 82 (725) Change in cash 25,075 (4,037) Cash, beginning of year 11,324 12,061 Cash, end of period 36,399 8,024 Net Cash From Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities was 23,870 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 17,428 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in net cash (used in) provided by operating activities during 2024 is primarily due to the gain on sale of 40,585 related to the disposition of the Precision Sport segment and an increase in cash outflows related to working capital of 18,859. These were partially offset by an increase in net income and deferred income taxes, as well as a decrease in contingent consideration benefit during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023.

 Free cash flow, defined as net cash (used in) provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, of 28,395) was used during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 12,933 generated during the same period in 2023. The Company believes that the non-GAAP measure, free cash flow, provides an understanding of the capital required by the Company to expand its asset base. A reconciliation of free cash flows to the nearest comparable GAAP financial measure is set forth below: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities (23,870) 17,428 Purchase of property and equipment (4,525) (4,495) Free cash flow (28,395) 12,933 Net Cash From Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities was 171,144 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash used in investing activities of 4,549 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash provided during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to the cash received related to the disposition of the Precision Sport segment, compared to the same period in 2023. Net Cash From Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was 122,281 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash used in financing activities of 16,191 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to the settlement of all outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility and term debt under the Restated Credit Agreement. Net Operating Loss As of December 31, 2023, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards NOLs and research and experimentation credit for U.S. federal income tax purposes of 7,699 and 2,997, respectively. The Company believes its U.S. Federal NOLs will offset a portion of its future U.S. Federal income taxes. The Company has 7,699 of NOLs, of which, 0 expire on December 31, 2024. These NOLs are subject to compliance with Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 Code ), as amended. As of December 31, 2023, the Company s gross deferred tax asset was 39,893. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance of 714, resulting in a net deferred tax asset of 39,179, before deferred tax liabilities of 34,434. The Company has provided a valuation allowance against a portion of the net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023, because the ultimate realization of those assets does not meet the more-likely-than-not criteria. Part of the Company s deferred tax assets consist of net operating loss carryforwards for federal tax purposes. If a change in control were to occur, these could be limited under Section 382 of the Code. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 18,000 in U.S. net deferred tax assets. These deferred tax assets are expected to reverse into NOL carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable in future periods. At this time, we consider it more likely than not that we will have sufficient taxable income in future periods that will allow us to realize these deferred tax assets. However, unless we can generate sufficient taxable income from our future operations, a valuation allowance to reduce our U.S. deferred tax assets may be required, which would materially increase our income tax expense in the period the allowance is recognized and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and consolidated financial position.

 Credit Agreement Upon the closing of the sale of the Precision Sport segment on February 29, 2024, the Company terminated and settled all outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility and term debt under the Restated Credit Agreement. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not engage in any transactions or have relationships or other arrangements with unconsolidated entities. These include special purpose and similar entities or other off-balance sheet arrangements. We also do not engage in energy, weather or other commodity-based contracts. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK There has not been any material change in the market risk disclosure contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company s management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Executive Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15I and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act )) as of September 30, 2024, pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company is accumulated and communicated to the appropriate management on a basis that permits timely decisions regarding disclosure. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s Executive Chairman and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, were effective. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in various legal disputes and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Based on currently available information, and except as disclosed herein, the Company does not believe that the existence of any of the legal disputes the Company or its subsidiaries is currently involved in will have a material adverse effect upon the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, except for the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission CPSC matter discussed below. It is possible that, as additional information becomes available, the impact on the Company of an adverse determination could have a different effect. See also Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors. . Litigation The Company is involved in various lawsuits arising from time to time that the Company considers ordinary routine litigation incidental to its business. Amounts accrued for litigation matters represent the anticipated costs (damages and/or settlement amounts) in connection with pending litigation and claims and related anticipated legal fees and other expenses or costs for defending such actions, which legal fees and expenses or costs are expensed as incurred. The costs are accrued when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The accruals are based upon the Company s assessment, after consultation with counsel (if deemed appropriate), of probable loss based on the facts and circumstances of each case, the legal issues involved, the nature of the claim made, the nature of the damages sought and any relevant information about the plaintiffs and other significant factors that vary by case. When it is not possible to estimate a specific expected cost to be incurred, the Company evaluates the range of probable loss and records the minimum end of the range. Based on currently available information, the Company does not believe that it is reasonably possible that the disposition of any of the legal disputes the Company or its subsidiaries is currently involved in will have a material adverse effect upon the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, except for the CPSC matter discussed below. There is a reasonable possibility of loss from contingencies in excess of the amounts accrued by the Company in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets; however, the actual amounts of such possible losses cannot currently be reasonably estimated by the Company at this time. It is possible that, as additional information becomes available, the impact on the Company could have a different effect. Product Liability As a consumer goods manufacturer and distributor, the Company faces the risk of product liability and related lawsuits involving claims for substantial money damages, product recall actions and higher than anticipated rates of warranty returns or other returns of goods. The Company is therefore vulnerable to various personal injury and property damage lawsuits relating to its products and incidental to its business. Except as disclosed herein, there are no pending product liability claims and lawsuits of the Company, which the Company believes in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, brand reputation, liquidity, stock price, consolidated financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. See also Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors. . U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission In January 2021, Black Diamond Equipment, Ltd. BDEL wrote to the CPSC outlining its new cradle solution for certain models of its avalanche beacon transceivers to prevent such transceivers from switching unexpectedly out of send mode. The proposed new cradle solution was designed to improve transceiver safety by locking the transceiver into send mode prior to use so that it would not switch unexpectedly out of send mode. BDEL also requested approval for the CPSC Fast-Track Program for a voluntary product recall to implement this cradle solution. The CPSC approved the recall and entered into a Corrective Action Plan agreement with BDEL in March 2021. BDEL received a letter from the CPSC, dated October 28, 2021, stating that the CPSC is investigating whether BDEL has timely complied with the reporting 

 43 

Table of Contents CLARUS CORPORATION 
 requirements of Section 15(b) of the Consumer Protection Safety Act and related regulations regarding certain models of avalanche transceivers switching unexpectedly out of send mode. Separately, on April 21, 2022, BDEL filed a Section 15(b) report and applied for Fast-Track consideration for a voluntary recall, consisting of free repair or replacement of such malfunctioning models of avalanche transceivers, which would not switch from send mode to search mode due to an electronic malfunction in the reed switch or foil. The CPSC approved the recall and entered into a Corrective Action Plan agreement with BDEL in August 2022. BDEL received a letter from the CPSC, dated January 17, 2023, stating that the CPSC is investigating whether BDEL has timely complied with the reporting requirements of Section 15(b) of the Consumer Protection Safety Act and related regulations regarding the malfunction in the reed switch or foil in certain models of avalanche transceivers switching out of search mode. BDEL responded to the CPSC s investigation by letter dated March 31, 2023, accompanied with documents responsive to the CPSC s requests. The CPSC asked for further clarification and documents, and BDEL sent a responsive letter accompanied by additional documents on June 23, 2023. On September 6, 2023, the CPSC requested further clarification and information regarding the reed switch issue, to which BDEL responded on October 6 and 13, 2023. By letters dated October 12, 2023 and December 18, 2023, BDEL was notified by the CPSC that the agency staff had concluded BDEL failed to timely meet our statutory reporting obligations under the Consumer Product Safety Act with respect to certain models of BDEL s avalanche transceivers switching unexpectedly out of send mode and certain models of BDEL s avalanche transceivers not switching from send mode into search mode, that BDEL made a material misrepresentation in a report to the CPSC, and that the agency staff intends to recommend that the CPSC impose civil monetary penalties of 16,135,000 and 9,000,000, respectively, for the two matters described above. On November 20, 2023 and February 8, 2024, respectively, BDEL submitted a comprehensive response disputing the CPSC s findings and conclusions in the October 12, 2023 and December 18, 2023 letters, including the amount of any potential penalties. The CPSC ultimately disagreed with our position and the agency staff has restated their recommendation for the monetary penalties which the Company intends to strongly contest and vigorously defend against. John C. Walbrecht, the former President of BDEL and the Company, received a letter from the CPSC dated June 25, 2024 alleging that in his personal capacity he knowingly violated the Consumer Product Safety Act by failing to timely report the occurrence resulting in beacons switching unexpectedly out of send mode. The staff of the CPSC recommended a 5,000,000 fine against Mr. Walbrecht personally. Pursuant to the Company s by-laws, the Company has agreed to indemnify Mr. Walbrecht and pay his legal fees, and he has provided an undertaking to the Company that the Company will be entitled to recover those expenses if it is ultimately determined that he was not entitled to indemnification. On August 26, 2024, Mr. Walbrecht s independent counsel responded to the CPSC, denying the allegations of its June 25 letter and rejecting its demand for a penalty. Based on currently available information, the Company believes an unfavorable outcome with the CPSC is probable, however, we cannot be sure on what terms this matter will be resolved. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a liability of 2,500,000 representing the low end of the range of our estimated exposure. The Company does not have a better estimate of the loss; therefore the low-end of the range was recorded as an accrued liability during the first quarter of 2024 and a corresponding expense is included in legal costs and regulatory matter expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in Part I, Item 1A. of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
