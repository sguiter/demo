NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

D. 

Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates impacting the Company s financial statements include revenue and expense accruals and oil and gas reserve quantities. In the oil and gas industry, and especially as related to the Company s natural gas sales, the processing of actual transactions generally occurs - days after the month of delivery of its product. Consequently, accounts receivable from production and oil and gas sales are recorded using estimated production volumes and market or contract prices. Differences between estimated and actual amounts are recorded in subsequent period s financial results. As is typical in the oil and gas industry, a significant portion of the Company s accounts receivable from production and oil and gas sales consists of unbilled receivables. Oil and gas reserve quantities are utilized in the calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization and the impairment of oil and gas wells and also impact the timing and costs associated with asset retirement obligations. The Company s estimates, especially those related to oil and gas reserves, could change in the near term and could significantly impact the Company s results of operations and financial position. 

Level I Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical financial instruments as of the reporting date. 

Level II Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date, and fair value is determined through the use of models or other valuation methodologies. 

Level III Pricing inputs are unobservable for the financial instrument and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the financial instrument. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. 

The Company s investments are carried at fair market value based on quoted prices available in active markets and are therefore classified as Level 1. 
 and , respectively, of operational advances. Operational advances held on behalf of employees, including officers, and directors were approximately and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

I. 

Revenue Recognition Revenues from contracts with customers are recognized when performance obligations are satisfied in accordance with contractual terms. 

For the sale of crude oil and natural gas from operated properties, the Company generally considers each unit (BBL or MCF) to be a separate performance obligation. The transaction price may consist of fixed and variable consideration, in which the variable amount is determinable each production period and is recognized as revenue upon pickup/delivery of the crude oil or natural gas, which is the point in time that the customer obtains control of the crude oil or natural gas and the Company's performance obligation is satisfied. 

Crude oil and natural gas sales derived from third party operated wells are recognized under similar terms as sales of crude oil and natural gas from operated properties and revenue is recognized at a point in time when the product is delivered, the purchaser obtains control and the Company's performance obligation is satisfied. 

Crude oil and natural gas sales represent the Company's share of revenues, net of royalties and other revenue interests owned by other parties. When settling crude oil and natural gas on behalf of royalty owners or working interest owners, the Company is acting as an agent and thus reports the revenue on a net basis. 

Based on the Company's judgment, the Company's performance obligations have been satisfied and an unconditional right to consideration exists at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023; therefore, the Company recognized amounts due from contracts with customers as production accounts receivable within the Company s consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

The Company utilizes the sales method to account for gas production volume imbalances. Under this method, revenue is recognized only when gas is produced and sold on the Company s behalf. The Company had no material gas imbalances at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

The Company participates (and may act as drilling contractor) with unaffiliated and affiliated joint venture partners, employees, including officers, and directors in the drilling, development and operation of jointly owned oil and gas properties. Each owner, including the Company, has an undivided interest in the jointly owned properties. Generally, the joint venture partners, employees and directors participate on the same drilling/development cost basis as the Company and, therefore, no revenue, expense or income is recognized on the drilling and development of the properties. Well management and operating revenues are derived from a variety of both verbal and written operating agreements with joint venture partners and are recognized monthly as services are provided and properties are managed and operated. Other revenues consist of miscellaneous revenues that are recognized at the time services are rendered, the Company has a contractual right to such revenue and collection is reasonably assured. 

J. 

Income Taxes - Everflow is not a tax-paying entity and the net taxable income or loss, other than the taxable income or loss allocable to EEI, which is a C corporation owned by Everflow, will be allocated directly to its respective partners. The Company is not able to determine the net difference between the tax bases and the reported amounts of Everflow s assets and liabilities due to separate elections that were made by owners of the working interests and limited partnership interests that comprised the Programs. 

The Company believes that it has appropriate support for any tax positions taken and, as such, does not have any uncertain tax positions that are material to the financial statements. 
 and recognized them as other income. The credits applied for were also recognized as other current assets. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, other current assets include and , respectively, of credits. 

of revenues and costs were allocated to the Unitholders (the limited partners) and of revenues and costs were allocated to the General Partner. Such allocation has changed and may change in the future due to Unitholders electing to exercise the Repurchase Right and select officers and employees electing to exercise options (see Note 3). 

Net income (loss) per limited partner Unit have been computed based on the weighted average number of Units outstanding during each period presented.

The partnership agreement provides that Everflow will repurchase for cash up to of the then outstanding Units, to the extent Unitholders offer Units to Everflow for repurchase pursuant to the Repurchase Right. The Repurchase Right entitles any Unitholder, between May 1 and June 30 of each year, to notify Everflow that the Unitholder elects to exercise the Repurchase Right and have Everflow acquire certain or all Units. The price to be paid for any such Units is calculated based upon the audited financial statements of the Company as of December 31 of the year prior to the year in which the Repurchase Right is to be effective and independently prepared reserve reports. The price per Unit equals of the adjusted book value of the Company allocable to the Units, divided by the number of Units outstanding at the beginning of the year in which the applicable Repurchase Right is to be effective less interim cash distributions received by a Unitholder. The adjusted book value is calculated by adding partners equity, the Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows and the tax effect included in the Standardized Measure and subtracting from that sum the carrying value of oil and gas properties (net of undeveloped lease costs). If more than of the then outstanding Units are tendered during any period during which the Repurchase Right is to be effective, the Investors Units tendered shall be prorated for purposes of calculating the actual number of Units to be acquired during any such period. The price associated with the 2024 Repurchase Right, based upon the December 31, 2023 calculation, was per Unit, net of a per Unit distribution made in April 2024. 

In June 2024, the Company repurchased Units pursuant to the Repurchase Right at the price of per Unit. In June 2023, the Company repurchased Units pursuant to the Repurchase Right at a price of per Unit. In June 2022, the Company repurchased Units pursuant to the Repurchase Right at a price of per Unit. 

The Company has an Option Repurchase Plan (the Option Plan which permits the grant of options to select officers and employees to purchase certain Units acquired by the Company pursuant to the Repurchase Right. The purpose of the Option Plan is to assist the Company to attract and retain officers and other key employees and to enable those individuals to acquire or increase their ownership interest in the Company in order to encourage them to promote the growth and profitability of the Company. The Option Plan is designed to align directly the financial interests of the participants with the financial interests of the Unitholders. The Company granted options to officers and key employees in June 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. All options granted were exercised on the same date. 

All Units repurchased pursuant to the Repurchase Right are retired except for those Units issued through the exercise of options pursuant to the Option Plan. There were outstanding Units following the Company s repurchase of Units and issuance of options in June 2024. There were no instruments outstanding at September 30, 2024 or 2023 that would potentially dilute net income (loss) per Unit. 

Item 2. 

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion is intended to assist in the understanding of the Company s liquidity, capital resources and results of operations. It is suggested that this information be read in conjunction with the Company s interim consolidated financial statements, the related notes to consolidated financial statements and the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 25, 2024. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Working capital of 34.5 million as of September 30, 2024 represented an increase of 474,000 from December 31, 2023, due primarily to an increase in investments and a decrease in accrued expenses, offset somewhat by decreases in cash and equivalents and production accounts receivable. The increase in investments is primarily the result of additional purchases of shares in a mutual fund during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in accrued expenses is primarily the result of all payroll and retirement plan contributions accrued at December 31, 2023 being paid during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 and less asset retirement obligations being classified as current at September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior comparable period. The decrease in production accounts receivable is the combined result of lower crude oil and natural gas prices received and a decrease in natural gas volumes produced during the current receivable production period as compared to the prior comparable period, offset somewhat by decreases in production costs incurred during the current receivable production period as compared to the prior comparable period. The decreases in natural gas volumes produced and production costs are primarily the result of additional Company operated properties being shut-in during the current receivable period that were otherwise producing during the prior comparable receivable period.

Table of Contents 

Long-term liabilities of 20.7 million as of September 30, 2024, represented an increase of 1.0 million from December 31, 2023, due primarily to accretion associated with asset retirement obligations and additional operational advances collected during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024. 

Partners equity of 20.3 million as of September 30, 2024 represented a decrease of 924,000 from December 31, 2023, due primarily to a Unitholder distribution paid in April 2024 and the repurchase of limited partnership Units related to the 2024 Repurchase Right paid in July 2024, offset somewhat by net income recognized during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024. 

The Company generally funds its operations with cash generated by operations and/or existing cash and equivalent balances. The Company has had no borrowings in 2024 or 2023 and no principal indebtedness was outstanding as of November 8, 2024. The Company s cash flow provided by operations before the change in working capital was 1.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 800,000 as compared to 2.4 million of cash flow provided by operations before the change in working capital during the prior comparable period. Changes in working capital from operations other than cash and equivalents decreased cash by 308,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cash flows provided by operating activities was 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Management of the Company believes cash flows and existing cash and equivalents should be sufficient to meet the current funding requirements of ongoing operations, capital investments to develop and/or purchase oil and gas properties, the repurchase of Units pursuant to the 2025 Repurchase Right, if necessary, and possibly the payment of future cash distributions. The Company used existing cash and equivalents to fund the payment of a Unitholder distribution amounting to approximately 963,000 in April 2024 and to fund the repurchase of Units related to the 2024 Repurchase Right amounting to approximately 207,000 in July 2024. 

The Company has multiple contracts with a gas purchaser which obligate the gas purchaser to purchase, and the Company to sell and deliver, certain quantities of natural gas production from the Company s oil and gas properties throughout the contract periods. Management believes the Company can meet its delivery commitments based on estimated production.

Revenues for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 decreased 184,000, or 16 , as compared to the prior comparable period. Revenues for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 decreased 953,000, or 21 , as compared to the prior comparable period. Both revenue variances were primarily the result of decreases in crude oil and natural gas sales. 

Crude oil and natural gas sales decreased 174,000, or 16 , during the three month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior comparable period. The decrease during the three month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior comparable period was primarily due to less crude oil and natural gas volumes produced. Crude oil and natural gas sales decreased 913,000, or 22 , during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior comparable period. The decrease during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior comparable period was primarily the result of lower average natural gas prices received and less crude oil and natural gas volumes produced during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior comparable period. The decrease in crude oil and natural gas volumes produced during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior comparable periods was primarily the result of Company operated properties being voluntarily shut-in during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 that were not shut-in during the prior comparable periods and production decline associated with existing oil and gas properties.

Table of Contents 

Depreciation, depletion and amortization DD A decreased 216,000, or 71 , during the three month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior comparable period. DD A decreased 578,000, or 66 , during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior comparable period. The primary reasons for both decreases are decreases in crude oil and natural gas volumes produced and the Company s oil and gas properties having less depletable basis available during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior comparable periods, offset somewhat by lower projected natural gas and crude oil reserves during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior comparable periods. The decrease in crude oil and natural gas volumes produced during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior comparable periods was primarily the result of Company operated properties being voluntarily shut-in during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 that were not shut-in during the prior comparable periods and production decline associated with existing oil and gas properties. The decrease in projected natural gas and crude oil reserves is primarily the result of lower benchmark crude oil and natural gas prices indexed during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the benchmark prices indexed throughout the prior comparable periods. 

Other income decreased 329,000, or 37 , during the three month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior comparable period. The decrease is primarily the result of a decrease in other income, offset somewhat by an increase in investment income. The decrease in other income is due to the ERC refund applied for by the Company during the three month period ended September 30, 2023. The increase in investment income is primarily due to additional unrealized gains on investments recognized by the Company during the three month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior comparable period. 

The Company reported a net loss of 24,000 during the three month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to net income of 282,000 during the three month period ended September 30, 2023. Net loss represented 2 of total revenues during the three month period ended September 30, 2024, whereas net income represented 24 of total revenues during the three month period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net income was primarily the result of decreases in crude oil and natural gas sales and other income recognized during the three month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior comparable period, offset somewhat by a decrease in DD A during the three month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior comparable period. The Company reported net income of 203,000 and 501,000 during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing 6 and 11 of total revenues during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in net income was primarily the result of a decrease in crude oil and natural gas sales during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior comparable period, offset somewhat by a decrease in DD A during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior comparable period.

Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The critical accounting policies that affect the Company s more complex judgments and estimates are described in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 

Forward-Looking Statements 

Except for historical financial information contained in this Form 10-Q, the statements made in this report are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act ). In addition, words such as expects, anticipate, intends, plans, believes, estimates, variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include price fluctuations in the gas market in the Appalachian Basin, actual oil and gas production and the ability to locate economically productive oil and gas prospects for development by the Company. In addition, any forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statement is made and the Company does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
