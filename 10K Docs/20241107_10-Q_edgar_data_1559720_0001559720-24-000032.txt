 Lodging Tax Obligations and Other Non-Income Tax Matters Platform Related Taxes and Collection Obligations 
 
 Some states and localities in the United States and elsewhere in the world impose transient occupancy or lodging accommodations taxes Lodging Taxes on the use or occupancy of lodging accommodations or other traveler services. As of September 30, 2024, the Company collects and remits Lodging Taxes in approximately jurisdictions around the world on behalf of its hosts. Such Lodging Taxes are generally remitted to tax jurisdictions within a to -day period following the end of each month. As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, the Company had an obligation to remit Lodging Taxes collected from guests on bookings in these jurisdictions totaling million and million, respectively. These payables were recorded in accrued expenses, accounts payable, and other current liabilities on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. In jurisdictions where the Company does not collect and remit Lodging Taxes, hosts are primarily responsible for such taxes. The Company

 million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company estimates that the reasonably possible loss related to certain Lodging Taxes that can be determined in excess of the amounts accrued is between million to million; however, no assurance can be given as to the outcomes and the Company could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. With respect to all other jurisdictions Lodging Taxes for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to determine an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued. 
 
 The Company s potential obligations with respect to Lodging Taxes could be affected by various factors, which include, but are not limited to, whether the Company determines or any tax authority asserts that the Company has a responsibility to collect lodging and related taxes on either historical or future transactions, or by the introduction of new ordinances and taxes that subject the Company s operations to such taxes. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of Lodging Taxes may be greater or less than the liabilities that the Company has recorded. 
 The Company is currently involved in disputes brought by certain domestic and international states and localities involving the payment of Lodging Taxes. These jurisdictions are asserting that the Company is liable or jointly liable with hosts to collect and remit Lodging Taxes. These disputes are in various stages and the Company continues to vigorously defend these claims. The Company believes that the statutes at issue impose a Lodging Tax obligation on the person exercising the taxable privilege of providing accommodations, or the Company s hosts. 
 
 The imposition of such taxes on the Company could increase the cost of a guest booking and potentially cause a reduction in the volume of bookings on the Company s platform, which would adversely impact the Company s results of operations. The Company will continue to monitor the application and interpretation of lodging and related taxes and ordinances and will adjust accruals based on any new information or further developments. The Company is under audit and inquiry by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regard to non-income tax matters. The subject matter of these contingent liabilities primarily arises from the Company s transactions with its customers. Such disputes involve the applicability of transactional taxes (such as sales, value-added, business, digital service, and similar taxes) to services provided, as well as the applicability of withholding tax on payments made to hosts. 
 
 The Company has estimated transactional tax liabilities in a certain number of jurisdictions where management believes it is probable that the Company can be held liable for such taxes and the related amounts can be reasonably estimated. As of September 30, 2024, accrued obligations related to these estimated taxes, including estimated penalties and interest, totaled million. In addition, the Company has identified reasonably possible exposures related to transactional taxes and business taxes and has not accrued for these amounts since the likelihood of the contingent liability is less than probable. As of September 30, 2024, the Company estimates that the reasonably possible loss related to these matters in excess of the amounts accrued is between million and million; however, no assurance can be given as to the outcomes and the Company could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. 
 
 As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, the Company accrued a total of million and million of estimated tax liabilities, including interest and penalties, related to hosts withholding tax obligations, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company estimates that the reasonably possible loss related to withholding income taxes that can be determined in excess of the amounts accrued is between million to million; however, no assurance can be given as to the outcomes and the Company could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and judicial processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcomes may exceed the estimated liabilities recorded. 
 
 In 2017, Italy passed a law purporting to require short-term rental platforms that process payments to withhold and remit host income tax and collect and remit tourist tax, amongst other obligations 2017 Law ). The Company challenged this law before the Italian courts and the Court of Justice of the European Union CJEU ). In December 2022, the CJEU found that European law does not prohibit member states from passing legislation requiring short-term rental platforms to withhold income taxes from their hosts, however a requirement to appoint a tax representative, on which the 2017 Law and the withholding obligations are based, is contrary to European Union EU law. In October 2023, the Italian national court upheld the ruling of the CJEU. The subsidiary in Ireland continues to be subject to tax audits in Italy. It and other group subsidiaries, including the Italian subsidiary, could in the future be subject to further tax audits in Italy, including in relation to permanent establishment, transfer pricing, and withholding obligations. 
 
 In May 2023, the Guardia di Finanza de Milano GdF issued a Tax Audit Report recommending to the Italian tax authorities a formal tax assessment of million Euro on Airbnb s subsidiary in Ireland relating to the 2017 Law and associated withholding tax obligations. On December 13, 2023, without admitting any liability, Airbnb Ireland signed an agreement with the Italian Revenue Agency ITA in settlement of the 2017-2021 audit period for an aggregate payment of million Euro million). Such agreement settles a dispute about Airbnb Ireland s obligations to withhold and remit host income tax, including taxes, interest, and penalties, for those relevant periods. The GdF conducted a withholding tax audit of Airbnb Ireland UC for the 2022 and 2023 tax years and issued a report to the ITA in March 2024. The Company has been in ongoing settlement discussions with the ITA since June 2024, which are expected to continue through the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 
 With respect to all other transactional taxes and withholding tax on payments made to hosts for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to determine an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued. 
 
 Payroll Taxes 
 
 The Company is subject to regular payroll tax examinations by various international, state and local jurisdictions. Although management believes its tax withholding remittance practices are appropriate, the Company may be subject to additional tax liabilities, including interest

 million for direct physical loss or damage to a host s covered property caused by guests during a confirmed booking and when the host and guest are unable to resolve the dispute. The Company retains risk and also maintains insurance from third parties on a per claim basis to protect the Company s financial exposure under this program. In addition, through third-party insurers and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, the Company provides insurance coverage for third-party bodily injury or property damage liability claims that occur during a stay. The Company s Host Liability Insurance and Experiences Liability Insurance consists of a commercial general liability policy, with hosts and the Company as named insureds and landlords of hosts as additional insureds. The Host Liability Insurance and Experiences Liability Insurance provides primary coverage for up to million per occurrence, subject to a million cap per listing location, and includes various market standard conditions, limitations, and exclusions.

 billion for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The income tax benefit was primarily due to the release of the valuation allowance of certain U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company recorded income tax expense of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, which primarily related to current and deferred tax on U.S. and foreign earnings, net of the income tax benefit from excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation. The increase in tax expense was primarily driven by deferred tax expense on the utilization of U.S. deferred tax assets due to the lack of a valuation allowance in the current period. 
 
 The Company regularly assesses the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets each quarter. In making that assessment, the Company considers both positive and negative evidence in the various jurisdictions in which it operates related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets to determine, based on the weight of available evidence, whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of September 30, 2023, based on all available positive and negative evidence, having demonstrated sustained profitability which is objective and verifiable, and taking into account anticipated future earnings, the Company concluded that it is more likely than not that its U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets will be realizable, with the exception of California research and development credits, capital loss carryovers, and certain losses subject to the dual consolidated loss rules. As of September 30, 2024, the Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance against its California research and development credit deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty regarding realizability of these deferred tax assets as they have not met the more likely than not realization criteria, particularly as the Company expects research and development tax credit generation to exceed its ability to use the credits in future years. When a change in valuation allowance is recognized during an interim period, the change in valuation allowance resulting from current year income is included in the annual effective tax rate and the release of valuation allowance supported by projections of future taxable income is recorded as a discrete tax benefit in the interim period. The Company will continue to monitor the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. 
 
 The Company s significant tax jurisdictions include the United States, California, and Ireland. The Company is currently under examination for income taxes by the Internal Revenue Service IRS for the 2013, 2016, 2017, and 2018 tax years. The primary issue under examination in the 2013 audit is the valuation of the Company s international intellectual property which was sold to a subsidiary in 2013. In December 2020, the Company received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment NOPA from the IRS which proposed an increase to the Company s U.S. taxable income that could result in additional income tax expense and cash liability of billion, plus penalties and interest, which exceeds the reserve recorded in its consolidated financial statements by more than billion. The Company strongly disagrees with the proposed adjustment and continues to vigorously contest it. In February 2021, the Company submitted a protest to the IRS describing its disagreement with the proposed adjustment and requesting the case be transferred to the IRS Independent Office of Appeals IRS Appeals ). In December 2021, the Company received a rebuttal from the IRS with the same proposed adjustments that were in the NOPA. In January 2022, the Company entered into an administrative dispute process with IRS Appeals. An acceptable outcome was not reached with IRS Appeals, and in May 2024, the Company received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency Notice from the IRS related to the aforementioned valuation of its international intellectual property. The Notice claims that the Company owes billion in tax, plus penalties and interest. The Company will continue to pursue all available remedies to resolve this dispute. In July 2024, the Company petitioned the U.S. Tax Court Tax Court for redetermination, and if necessary, the Company will appeal the Tax Court s decision to the appropriate appellate court. The Company believes that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from these examinations. If the IRS prevails in the assessment of additional tax due based on its position and such tax and related interest and penalties, if any, exceeds the Company s current reserves, such outcome could have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial position and results of operations, and any assessment of additional tax could require a significant cash payment and have a material adverse impact on the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flow.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Annual Report ). This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the section titled Risk Factors of our 2023 Annual Report. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future. 

Overview 
 
 We are a community based on connection and belonging a community that was born in 2007 when two hosts welcomed three guests to their San Francisco home, and has since grown to over 5 million hosts who have welcomed over 2 billion guest arrivals in almost every country and region across the globe. Every day, hosts offer unique stays and experiences that make it possible for guests to connect with communities in a more authentic way. 
 
 We have five stakeholders and we have designed our Company with all of them in mind. Along with employees and shareholders, we serve hosts, guests, and the communities in which they live. We intend to make long-term decisions considering all of our stakeholders because their collective success is key for our business to thrive. 

Third Quarter Financial Highlights 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenue grew by 10 to 3.7 billion, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of check-ins relating to Nights and Experiences Booked and a modest increase in Average Daily Rate ADR ). 
 
 Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 69 to 1.4 billion, compared to the same period in the prior year, driven by an increase in income tax expense of 3.1 billion, primarily due to the prior year s valuation allowance release of our U.S. deferred tax assets of 2.8 billion, and the recognition of deferred tax expense related to the utilization of some of those assets in the current year. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA 1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 7 to 2.0 billion, compared to the same period in the prior year, driven by growth in the number of check-ins relating to Nights and Experiences Booked and a modest increase in ADR. 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 1.1 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.3 billion, in the same period in the prior year. We generated Free Cash Flow 1 of 1.1 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.3 billion, in the same period in the prior year. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 8.7 million shares of Class A common stock for 1.1 billion, leaving 4.2 billion available to repurchase under our share repurchase program. 

Key Business Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 We track the following key business metrics and financial measures that are not calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ( non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our operating performance, identify trends, formulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Accordingly, we believe that these key business metrics and non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management team. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance, and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial information to supplement their U.S. GAAP results. 
 
 These key business metrics and non-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and may be different from similarly titled metrics or measures presented by other companies. A reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with U.S. GAAP is provided under the subsection titled Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation and Free Cash Flow Reconciliation below. Investors are encouraged to review the related U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.

 Nights and Experiences Booked 
 
 Nights and Experiences Booked is a key measure of the scale of our platform, which in turn drives our financial performance. Nights and Experiences Booked on our platform in a period represents the sum of the total number of nights booked for stays and the total number of seats booked for experiences, net of cancellations and alterations that occurred in that period. For example, a booking made on February 15 would be reflected in Nights and Experiences Booked for our quarter ended March 31. If, in the example, the booking were canceled on May 15, Nights and Experiences Booked would be reduced by the cancellation for our quarter ended June 30. A night can include one or more guests and can be for a listing with one or more bedrooms. Nights and Experiences Booked grows as we attract new customers to our platform and as repeat guests increase their activity on our platform. A seat is booked for each participant in an experience. Substantially all of the bookings on our platform to date have come from nights. We believe Nights and Experiences Booked is a key business metric to help investors and others understand and evaluate our results of operations in the same manner as our management team, as it represents a single unit of transaction on our platform. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had 122.8 million Nights and Experiences Booked, an 8 increase from 113.2 million for the same period in the prior year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had 380.5 million Nights and Experiences Booked, a 9 increase from 349.4 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase was driven by growth across all regions, with the strongest growth percentages in Asia Pacific and Latin America, as we continue to focus on international expansion. 
 
 Gross Booking Value 
 
 GBV represents the dollar value of bookings on our platform in a period and is inclusive of host earnings, service fees, cleaning fees, and taxes, net of cancellations and alterations that occurred during that period. The timing of recording GBV and any related cancellations is similar to that described in the subsection titled Key Business Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures Nights and Experiences Booked above. Revenue from the booking is recognized upon check-in; accordingly, GBV is a leading indicator of revenue. The entire amount of a booking is reflected in GBV during the quarter in which booking occurs, whether the guest pays the entire amount of the booking upfront or elects to use our Pay Less Upfront program. Growth in GBV reflects our ability to attract and retain customers and reflects growth in Nights and Experiences Booked. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our GBV was 20.1 billion, a 10 increase from 18.3 billion for the same period in the prior year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our GBV was 64.2 billion, an 11 increase from 57.8 billion for the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in Nights and Experiences Booked, combined with a modest increase in ADR. We saw GBV growth across all regions, with the strongest growth percentages in Asia Pacific and EMEA. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Our non-GAAP financial measures include Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, which are described below. A reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with U.S. GAAP is provided below. Investors are encouraged to review the related U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, should be considered as supplemental in nature, and is not meant as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including net income and our other U.S. GAAP results. Free Cash Flow has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other U.S. GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities. Free Cash Flow does not reflect our ability to meet future contractual commitments and may be calculated differently by other companies in our industry, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.

 (1) Stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of our compensation strategy. 
 
 The above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because they are non-cash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items are unpredictable, not driven by core results of operations, and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA increased by 124 million to 2.0 billion while Adjusted EBITDA Margin decreased slightly to 52 from 54 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by growth in the number of check-ins relating to Nights and Experiences Booked and a modest increase in ADR. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA increased by 361 million to 3.3 billion while Adjusted EBITDA margin remained consistent at 38 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year. The improvements in Adjusted EBITDA were primarily driven by growth in the number of check-ins relating to Nights and Experiences Booked and a modest increase in ADR. 
 
 During the three months ended September 2023, we released 2.8 billion of our valuation allowance related to our U.S. deferred tax assets (see Note 10, Income Taxes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details).

 Free Cash Flow Reconciliation 
 
 The following is a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to the most comparable U.S. GAAP cash flow measure, net cash provided by operating activities (in millions, except percentages): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2024 2023 2024 Revenue 3,397 3,732 7,699 8,622 Net cash provided by operating activities 1,325 1,078 3,821 4,052 Purchases of property and equipment (15) (4) (30) (26) Free Cash Flow 1,310 1,074 3,791 4,026 Free Cash Flow as a percentage of revenue 39 29 49 47 
 
 Our Free Cash Flow is impacted by the timing of GBV because we collect our service fees at the time of booking, which is generally before a stay or experience occurs. Funds held on behalf of our customers and amounts payable to our customers do not impact Free Cash Flow, except interest earned on these funds. The decrease in Free Cash Flow for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in the prior year, was primarily driven by the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities. 

Seasonality 
 
 Our business is seasonal, reflecting typical travel behavior patterns over the course of the calendar year. In a typical year, the first, second, and third quarters have higher Nights and Experiences Booked than the fourth quarter, as guests plan for travel during the peak travel season, which is in the third quarter for North America and EMEA. 
 
 Our key business metrics, including GBV and Adjusted EBITDA, can also be impacted by the timing of holidays and other events. We experience seasonality in our GBV that is generally consistent with the seasonality of Nights and Experiences Booked. Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highest in the third quarter when we have the most check-ins, which is the point at which we recognize revenue. Seasonal trends in our GBV impact Free Cash Flow for any given quarter. A significant portion of our costs are relatively fixed across quarters or vary in line with the volume of transactions, and we historically achieve our highest GBV in the first and second quarters of the year with comparatively lower check-ins. As a result, increases in unearned fees typically make our Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow as a percentage of revenue the highest in the first two quarters of the year. We typically see a slight decline in GBV and a peak in check-ins in the third quarter, which results in a decrease in unearned fees, a lower sequential decrease in Free Cash Flow, and a greater decline in GBV in the fourth quarter, where Free Cash Flow is typically lower.

 Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with the Same Periods in 2023 
 
 The provision for income taxes during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by current tax on U.S. and foreign earnings and deferred tax expense resulting from last year s valuation allowance release on our U.S. deferred tax assets and the utilization of some of those assets in the current year. The income tax benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to the release of 2.8 billion of our valuation allowance related to certain of our U.S. deferred tax assets, as a discrete tax benefit during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 In 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD established an inclusive framework on base erosion and profit shifting and agreed on a two-pillar solution to global taxation, focusing on global profit allocation, known to as Pillar One and a 15 global minimum effective tax rate, known as Pillar Two. On December 15, 2022, the EU member states agreed to implement the OECD s global minimum tax rate of 15 . The OECD issued Pillar Two model rules and continues to release guidance on these rules. The inclusive framework calls for tax law changes by participating countries to take effect in 2024 and 2025. Various countries have enacted or have

Table of Contents 

 announced plans to enact new tax laws to implement the global minimum tax. We considered the applicable tax law changes on Pillar Two implementation in the relevant countries, and concluded there was no material impact to our tax provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. We will continue to evaluate the impact of these tax law changes on future reporting periods. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Sources and Conditions of Liquidity 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling 11.3 billion. As of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled 7.7 billion, which included 2.2 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash and cash equivalents consist of checking and interest-bearing accounts and highly-liquid securities with an original maturity of 90 days or less. As of September 30, 2024, short-term investments totaled 3.6 billion. Short-term investments primarily consist of highly-liquid investment grade corporate debt securities, time deposits, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. government and government agency debt securities government bonds ), and mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. These amounts do not include funds of 6.6 billion as of September 30, 2024, that we held for bookings in advance of guests completing check-ins that we record separately on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet in funds receivable and amounts held on behalf of customers with a corresponding liability in funds payable and amounts payable to customers. 
 
 Our cash and cash equivalents are generally held at large global systemically important banks (or G-SIBs which are subject to high capital requirements and are required to regularly perform stringent stress tests related to their ability to absorb capital losses. Our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments held outside the United States may be repatriated, subject to certain limitations, and would be available to be used to fund our domestic operations. However, repatriation of such funds may result in additional tax liabilities. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments balances in the United States are sufficient to fund our working capital needs in the United States. 
 
 We have access to 1.0 billion of commitments and a 200 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit under the 2022 Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, no amounts were drawn under the 2022 Credit Facility and outstanding letters of credit totaled 25 million. See Note 7, Debt , to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q additional information. 
 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding 2.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness of our 0 convertible senior notes due in 2026. On March 3, 2021, in connection with the pricing of the 2026 Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the Capped Calls with certain of the initial purchasers and other financial institutions (the "option counterparties") at a cost of approximately 100 million. The cap price of the Capped Calls was 360.80 per share of Class A common stock, which represented a premium of 100 over the last reported sale price of the Class A common stock of 180.40 per share on March 3, 2021, subject to certain customary adjustments under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions. 
 
 In February 2024, our board of directors approved an additional share repurchase program to purchase up to 6.0 billion of our Class A common stock. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased an aggregate of 8.7 million and 18.3 million shares of Class A common stock for 1.1 billion and 2.6 billion, respectively through our share repurchase programs. As of September 30, 2024, we had 4.2 billion available to repurchase shares of Class A common stock under our share repurchase program. 

Cash Flows 
 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in millions): 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2024 Net cash provided by operating activities 3,821 4,052 Net cash used in investing activities (567) (396) Net cash used in financing activities (1,259) (2,242) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (10) 117 Net increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 1,985 1,531 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 4.1 billion, which was primarily due to net income of 2.2 billion, additional cash provided by unearned fees of 233 million, resulting from growth in bookings, and an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of 218 million, which is net of a 163 million tax payment to the IRS related to a 2013 matter under examination. Additionally, we had adjustments for non-cash charges, primarily consisting of 1.0 billion of stock-based compensation expense. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 396 million, which was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments, partially offset by proceeds resulting from sales and maturities of short-term investments. 
 
 30 

Table of Contents 

 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.2 billion, primarily due to share repurchases of 2.6 billion and an increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards of 422 million, partially offset by an increase in funds payable and amounts payable to customers of 665 million. 
 
 The effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash on our consolidated statements of cash flows relates to certain of our assets, principally cash balances held on behalf of customers, that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of certain of our subsidiaries. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a decrease of 117 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. The impact of exchange rate changes on cash balances can serve as a natural hedge for the effect of exchange rates on our liabilities to our hosts and guests. 
 
 We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our short and long-term cash requirements. As such, we believe that the cash flows generated from operating activities will meet our anticipated cash requirements in the short-term. In addition to normal working capital requirements, we anticipate that our short- and long-term cash requirements will include share repurchases, introduction of new products and offerings, timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform, debt repayments, and expansion of sales and marketing activities. Our future capital requirements, however, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our growth, headcount, and ability to attract and retain customers on our platform. Additionally, we may in the future raise additional capital or incur additional indebtedness to continue to fund our strategic initiatives. On a long-term basis, we would rely on either our access to the capital markets or our credit facility for any long-term funding not provided by operating cash flows and cash on hand. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may seek to raise additional funds at any time through equity, equity-linked arrangements, and/or debt, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired and at reasonable rates, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in the section titled "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" in Item 3. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our 2023 Annual Report for a discussion of the assumptions and judgments involved in our critical accounting estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a description of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 There have been no material changes in our market risk during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . For additional information, see Part II, Item 7A. " Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk " in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Table of Contents 

 Limitations on Controls 
 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their desired objectives. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 We are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business. These include proceedings, claims, and investigations relating to, among other things, regulatory matters, commercial matters, intellectual property, competition, tax, employment, pricing, discrimination, consumer rights, personal injury, and property rights. See Note 9, Commitments and Contingencies, to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Depending on the nature of the proceeding, claim, or investigation, we may be subject to monetary damage awards, fines, penalties, or injunctive orders. Furthermore, the outcome of these matters could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The outcomes of legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant judgment to determine the likelihood and amount of loss related to such matters. While it is not possible to determine the outcomes, we believe based on our current knowledge that the resolution of all such pending matters will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 There have been no material changes from the risk factors set forth in Part I, Item IA of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the Annual Report ).

The risks and uncertainties described in these reports may not be the only ones we face. The factors discussed in these reports, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results and those expressed in forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the SEC, press releases, communications with investors, and oral statements.

 1,491,465.37 10 1 35 - 9 30 36 73.47 
 1,536,209.33 10 1 36 - 9 30 37 75.68 1,582,295.61 
 All such monthly Base Rent shall be payable by Tenant in accordance with the terms of the Lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in the Lease to the contrary, commencing as of the Extended Term Commencement Date, Base Rent shall be paid to Landlord net of all costs and expenses, as provided in Section 5 below. Sections 3.4(a) and (b) of the Initial Lease will not be applicable to the obligation to pay Base Rent during the Extended Term and, effective as of the Extension Date, will be deemed deleted and deemed null, void and of no further force or effect. 
 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, provided there is no Event of Default under the Lease, Landlord hereby agrees to abate Tenant s obligation to pay Base Rent and Tenant s Percentage Share of Operating Expenses and Property Taxes during (a) the first (1 st through the ninth (9 th full calendar months, inclusive, of the Extended Term (i.e., January 2027 through September 2027, inclusive) (the Construction Period (such amount of abated Rent during the Construction Period being referred to herein as the Construction Period Abated Amount ), and (b) the tenth (10 th through the nineteenth (19 th full calendar months, inclusive, of the Extended Term (i.e., October 2027 through July 2028, inclusive) (the Abatement Period (such amount of abated Rent during the Abatement Period being referred to herein as the Abated Rent (the Construction Period Abated Amount and the Abated Rent are collectively referred to herein as the Abated Amount ).

Tenant acknowledges that any Event of Default will cause Landlord to incur costs not contemplated hereunder, the exact amount of such costs being extremely difficult and impracticable to ascertain. Therefore, should there be an Event of Default at any time during the Construction Period or the Abatement Period, then the right to the abatement of any then-remaining Abated Amount shall suspended from the date of such Event of Default until the date, if at all, that Tenant cures such Event of Default, at which point Tenant will be once again afforded the benefit of abating the then-remaining Abated Amount at the monthly amounts originally contemplated above, regardless of what the then-current monthly Rent payable is under the Lease (i.e., if the then-scheduled monthly Base Rent, Operating Expenses and Property Taxes exceed the originally scheduled monthly amount of the Abated Amount, then Tenant will only be entitled to the abatement of the originally scheduled monthly Abated Amount and will be obligated to pay any differential between the two sums). Additionally if, at any point during either or both of the Construction Period or the Abatement Period, Tenant is entitled to an abatement of Rent pursuant to the provisions of Articles 12 or 13 of the Initial 
 
 -4- 

Lease, then the abatement of Rent described above with respect to the Construction Period or the Abatement Period, as applicable, will be suspended during the pendency of any such Casualty or Taking, and reinstated immediately following the expiration of any such Casualty or Taking related abatement of Rent (at the rates applicable to the originally scheduled periods, as described above). Tenant acknowledges and agrees that nothing in this paragraph is intended to limit any other remedies available to Landlord at law or in equity under applicable law (including, without limitation, the remedies under Civil Code Section 1951.2 and or 1951.4 and any successor statutes or similar laws), in the event Tenant defaults under the Lease beyond any applicable cure period. 
 5. Tenant s Percentage Share of Operating Expenses and Property Taxes . Notwithstanding anything in the Amended Lease to the contrary, commencing as of the Extended Term Commencement Date, Tenant shall pay Tenant s Percentage of Operating Expenses and Property Taxes on a net basis, without taking into account any Base Year, and the Rent shall be absolutely net to Landlord. Commencing as of the Extended Term Commencement Date and continuing for the duration of the Extended Term, Tenant shall pay Tenant s Percentage Share of Operating Expenses and Property Taxes for the Premises pursuant to the terms of the Lease (i.e., Tenant will no longer to obligated to pay only the excess thereof above the Base Year). For the purposes of determining Tenant s Percentage Share of Operating Expenses and Property Taxes, Tenant s Percentage Share shall be 68.17 , based on the Premises containing 250,903 RSF and the Building (excluding the basement below-grade areas of the Building) containing 368,042 RSF.

 c. Provided there is no then-current Event of Default under the Lease, commencing as of January 1, 2027, Landlord shall provide Tenant with an allowance of 122.50 per RSF of the Premises (i.e., 30,735,617.50, based on the Premises containing 250,903 RSF) (the Allowance ), plus a space planning allowance to pay for preparation of a space plan (copies of which shall be provided to Landlord in

 Tenant acknowledges that completion of the Landlord s Work is not required for the Reduction Effective Date, the Expansion Effective Date, and or the Extended Term Commencement Date, and agrees that the Landlord s Work may be conducted, at Landlord s discretion, while Tenant is in occupancy of the Premises and paying Rent under the Lease. Landlord agrees to use good faith, commercially reasonable efforts to conduct the performance of the Landlord s Work in a manner which minimizes disturbance to Tenant s business operations within the affected areas of the Premises to the extent practicable. Tenant agrees to cooperate with Landlord and to make the Premises, the Building and the Project reasonably available to Landlord and its contractors for the performance of such work. Tenant acknowledges that some interruptions and or interference with Tenant s business may occur during the course of the Landlord s Work, but agrees that no interruptions or inconveniences to Tenant or its business suffered as a result of the Landlord s Work shall constitute an eviction of Tenant from the Premises, whether constructive or otherwise, and Tenant shall in no event, be excused from paying any Rent that it is scheduled to pay pursuant to the terms of the Lease. Landlord may or may not perform the Landlord s Work during normal business hours. If the Landlord s Work is performed after Tenant s business hours at Tenant s request, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the additional third party costs, if any, actually incurred by Landlord to perform the Landlord s Work after business hours. Landlord and Tenant shall in good faith cooperate and cause their respective employees, agents and contractors to cooperate with the other during the period in which Landlord is constructing the Landlord s Work in an effort to expedite completion of the Landlord s Work as well as to minimize any interference with Tenant s business operations in the Premises.

For so long as Landlord is T-C 888 BRANNAN OWNER, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, Landlord will submit applications for building permits for any work to be performed by Landlord under the address 888 Brannan provided, however, that nothing in the foregoing will prohibit or restrict Landlord from submitting or revising permit applications to be under 850 Brannan and or 870 Brannan after the City has required Landlord to do so. 
 7. Atrium . The Atrium area of the 870 Building is depicted in Exhibit E attached hereto Atrium ). Following the completion of Landlord s Work (which Landlord currently plans to commence in the first calendar quarter of 2025), Tenant will have the exclusive right to use the Atrium and, so long as the Atrium area remains configured as an atrium, Tenant may make Alterations (as defined in the Amended Lease) thereto subject to the terms of the Amended Lease (including, without limitation, Sections 10.1 through 10.5 of the Initial Lease), provided that Landlord, its agents, employees will have the right to (a) use the Atrium to access the Project management office located in the 870 Building (Tenant agrees to provide access devices to permit such access at all times), and (b) enter the Atrium under the same terms as are applicable to Landlord s entry into the Premises under the Amended Lease.

Following the completion of Landlord s Work, the provisions of Section 5 of the Third Amendment and Sections 11 and 12 of the Fourth Amendment will no longer be applicable (because the Atrium will part of the Premises), although Tenant will continue to provide Landlord with evidence that any vendors of Tenant using or operating within the Atrium have liability insurance naming Landlord and its property manager as additional insureds reasonably satisfactory to Landlord prior to using the Atrium for any events. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 7 shall be construed to grant Tenant any right to use the Common Area courtyard. 
 8. Decatur Alley and Parking Lot . At Tenant s option, Tenant, at its sole cost and expense, may petition the City of San Francisco to convert Decatur alley into a non-vehicle street so long as Landlord will not incur any obligations or liabilities in connection therewith, provided that (a) such petition will be subject to Landlord s prior written approval in its reasonable discretion, which approval will not be unreasonably delayed and (b) in no event will any conditions of approval or requirements associated therewith be binding on Landlord or the Building unless approved by Landlord in advance in its sole discretion.

The location of Tenant s Generator shall be limited to the area determined by Landlord in its sole discretion, provided that Landlord agrees to reasonably cooperate with Tenant in determining the most suitable location for the placement of Tenant s Generator.

For these purposes, a sealed, uncracked concrete slab containment area without drains shall be sufficient (but shall not be the exclusive method) to constitute the second containment system, provided it is large enough to completely contain a release of the maximum volume of Hazardous Materials which could be present in the first containment system. All handling, use, storage and disposal of Hazardous Materials relating to the AST or Tenant s Generator shall be accomplished by Tenant at its sole cost and expense in accordance with this Section 9 and the terms and conditions of Section 7.3 of the Initial Lease. If Tenant desires to install a generator other than the Initial Generator, Tenant may do so on the terms set forth in this Section 9 provided that Tenant surrenders the Initial Generator to Landlord in good operating condition and repair, removes all equipment and improvements installed by or for Tenant in order for the Initial Generator to serve the Premises and restores all areas affected thereby as reasonably required by Landlord. 
 Subject to Landlord s prior approval of Tenant s plans and specifications, Tenant shall have the right to install an emergency generator connection on the outside of the Building for the purpose of connecting the Initial Generator or any subsequent Tenant s Generator to the Premises and an appurtenant electrical grounding system. Furthermore, Tenant shall have the right to install conduits from the Initial Generator or any subsequent Tenant s Generator to the Premises, provided, however, that such conduits are installed below grade to Landlord s reasonable satisfaction in accordance with the design and architectural standards for the Building. 
 If Tenant installs a generator other than the Initial Generator, then prior to or within sixty (60) days following the expiration or earlier termination of the Extended Term (as the same may be further extended), Tenant agrees upon Landlord s request to (i) promptly remove from the Project, at its sole cost and expense, the AST (including, at Landlord s request, the slab), if any, and Tenant s Generator and all Hazardous Materials which are brought upon, stored, used, generated or released upon, in, under or about the Premises, the Project or any portion thereof by Tenant or any Tenant Parties in connection with Tenant s Generator or AST, and (ii) return the Premises and the balance of the Building and Project which were affected by the installation and operation of Tenant s Generator, the AST and all associated equipment to substantially the condition existing prior to Tenant s installation of Tenant s Generator and AST. 
 Tenant shall be solely responsible for complying with any and all Environmental Laws relating to the AST, Tenant s Generator and all Hazardous Materials associated with either of the same, including, without limitation, all permitting and tank installations, monitoring and removal closure obligations. For purposes of all Environmental Laws, Tenant shall be the owner and operator of the AST. Tenant shall be responsible for ensuring compliance by all Tenant Parties with all Environmental Laws relating to the AST and Tenant s Generator. Any acknowledgment, consent or approval by Landlord of Tenant s use or handling of Hazardous Materials shall not constitute an assumption of risk respecting the same nor a warranty or certification by Landlord that Tenant s proposed use and handling of Hazardous Materials is safe or reasonable or in compliance with Environmental Laws. 
 
 -8- 

From time to time during the Extended Term (as the same may hereafter be extended) and for up to one hundred eighty (180) days thereafter, if required by any government agency, or in the event Landlord has actual knowledge of a Hazardous Materials release at the Premises which resulted from a fuel leak relating to the AST, Landlord may, and upon Landlord s request, Tenant shall, retain a registered environmental consultant Consultant reasonably acceptable to Landlord to conduct an environmental investigation of the Project Environmental Assessment (i) for Hazardous Materials contamination in, about or beneath the Project relative to the AST or Tenant s Generator, and (ii) to assess the activities of Tenant and all Tenant Parties with respect to Tenant s Generator and the AST for compliance with all Environmental Laws and to recommend the use of procedures intended to reasonably reduce the risk of a release of Hazardous Materials. If the Environmental Assessment discloses any material breach of Environmental Laws by Tenant or any Tenant Parties, then the cost thereof shall be the sole responsibility of Tenant, payable as Additional Rent under the Lease.
