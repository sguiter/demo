Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Overview
of our Business 

Venetian-1
Acquisition Corp. was incorporated in the State of Delaware on September 24, 2021. Since inception, the Company has been engaged in organizational
efforts and obtaining initial financing. The Company was formed as a vehicle to pursue a business combination and has focused its efforts
to identify a possible business combination. No revenue has been generated by the Company since inception. It is unlikely the Company
will have any revenues unless it is able to effect an acquisition or merger with an operating company, of which there can be no assurance.
The Company s plan of operation for the remainder of the fiscal year shall be to continue its efforts to locate suitable acquisition
candidates. Our principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential
through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. The Company will not restrict our potential candidate
target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business. 

The
Company is currently considered to be a blank check company. The SEC defines those companies as any development
stage company that is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3(a)(51) of the Exchange Act, and that has no specific business
plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies. Many states have
enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of blank check companies in their respective jurisdictions.
The Company is also a shell company, defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act as a company with no or nominal assets
(other than cash) and no or nominal operations. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our
securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination. The Company intends to comply with the
periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as we are subject to those requirements. 

In
addition, the Company is an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act, and may take advantage of certain exemptions
from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies 
including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, and exemptions from the requirements of Sections 14A(a) and (b) of the Exchange Act to hold a nonbinding advisory vote of shareholders
on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 

The
Company has also elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1)
of the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates
for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements
may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. 

We
will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year during which our revenues
exceed 1.235 billion, (2) the date on which we issue more than 1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three year period, (3) the last
day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective
registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act, or (4) when the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates
exceeds 700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter. To the extent that we continue
to qualify as a smaller reporting company, as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, after we cease
to qualify as an emerging growth company, certain of the exemptions available to us as an emerging growth company may continue to be
available to us as a smaller reporting company, including: (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements
of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act; (2) scaled executive compensation disclosures; and (3) the requirement to provide only two
years of audited financial statements, instead of three years. 

The
Company has not conducted any active operations since inception, except for its efforts to locate suitable acquisition candidates. No
revenue has been generated by the Company since inception. It is unlikely the Company will have any revenues unless it is able to effect
an acquisition or merger with an operating company, of which there can be no assurance. The Company s plan of operation for the
remainder of the fiscal year shall be to continue its efforts to locate suitable acquisition candidates. Our principal business objective
for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather
than immediate, short-term earnings. The Company will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business,
industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business. 

2 

The
Company does not currently engage in any business activities that provide cash flow. The costs of investigating and analyzing business
combinations for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be paid with funds to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders,
management or other investors. 

During
the next twelve months we anticipate incurring costs related to: 

(i) filing Exchange Act reports, and 

(ii) investigating, analyzing and consummating an acquisition. 

We
believe we will be able to meet these costs through use of funds to be loaned by or invested in us by our stockholders, management or
other investors. There are no assurances that such funds will be advanced or that the Company will be able to secure any additional funding
as needed. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 2,269 in cash. On September 24, 2021, in connection with advances made in connection
with costs incurred by the Company, the Company issued a promissory note to Mark Tompkins, a stockholder and director of the Company,
pursuant to which the Company agreed to repay Mr. Tompkins the sum of any and all amounts that Mr. Tompkins may advance to the Company
on or before the date that the Company consummates a business combination with a private company or reverse takeover transaction or other
transaction after which the Company would cease to be a shell company (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act). The Company
has used the proceeds from the note to cover its expenses. Although Mr. Tompkins has no obligation to advance funds to the Company under
the terms of the note, it is anticipated that he may advance funds to the Company as fees and expenses are incurred in the future. As
a result, the Company issued the note in anticipation of such advances. Interest shall not accrue on the outstanding principal amount
of the note except if an Event of Default (as defined in the note) has occurred. In the event of an Event of Default, the entire note
shall automatically become due and payable (the Default Date and starting from five (5) days after the Default Date, the
interest rate on the note shall accrue at the rate of eighteen percent (18 per annum. As of September 30, 2024, the total amount due
under the note was 127,500. The note is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1. Except as disclosed herein, we currently have no other agreements
or specific arrangements in place with our stockholders, management or other investors. 

Our
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary
financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Our ability to
continue as a going concern is also dependent on our ability to find a suitable target company and enter into a possible reverse merger
with such company. Management s plan includes obtaining additional funds by equity financing through a reverse merger transaction
and/or related party advances, however there is no assurance of additional funding being available. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had 2,269 of cash and has not earned any revenues from operations to date. In the next 12 months,
we expect to incur expenses equal to approximately 40,000 related to legal, accounting, audit, and other professional service fees incurred
in relation to the Company s Exchange Act filing requirements. The costs related to the acquisition of a business combination target
company vary widely and are dependent on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the amount of time it takes to complete
a business combination, the location of the target company, the size and complexity of the business of the target company, whether stockholders
of the Company prior to the transaction will retain equity in the Company, the scope of the due diligence investigation required, the
involvement of the Company s auditors in the transaction, possible changes in the Company s capital structure in connection
with the transaction, and whether funds may be raised contemporaneously with the transaction. Therefore, we believe such costs are unascertainable
until the Company identifies a business combination target. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as
a going concern. The Company is currently devoting its efforts to locating merger candidates. The Company s ability to continue
as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to develop additional sources of capital, locate and complete a merger with another
company, and ultimately, achieve profitable operations. 

3 

The
Company may consider acquiring a business which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional funds
for expansion into new products or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established business which may be
experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. Our management believes that the public company
status that results from a combination with the Company will provide such company greater access to the capital markets, increase its
visibility in the investment community, and offer the opportunity to utilize its stock to make acquisitions. There is no assurance that
we will in fact have access to additional capital or financing as a public company. In the alternative, a business combination may involve
the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital, but which desires to establish a public
trading market for its shares, while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control which
may occur in a public offering. 

Any
target business we select for a potential business combination may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages
of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous
risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition,
we may affect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, and, although our management
will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain
or assess all significant risks. 

Our
management anticipates that it will likely be able to effect only one business combination, due primarily to our limited financing and
the dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders, which is likely to occur as a result of our management s plan
to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a tax-free reorganization. This lack of diversification should
be considered a substantial risk in investing in us, because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against
gains from another. 

The
Company anticipates that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky. While the Company is in a competitive
market with a small number of business opportunities, through information obtained from industry professionals including attorneys, investment
bankers, and other consultants with experience in the reverse merger industry, our management believes that there are opportunities for
a business combination with firms seeking the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of
becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing
may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock
options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like
through the issuance of stock. Potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages
of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult
and complex. 

We
do not currently intend to retain any entity to act as a finder to identify and analyze the merits of potential target
businesses. However, we contemplate that Montrose Capital may introduce business combination opportunities to us. There are currently
no agreements or preliminary agreements between us and Montrose Capital. 

We
have not established a specific timeline, nor have we created a specific plan to identify an acquisition target and consummate a business
combination. We expect that our management and the Company, through its various contacts and affiliations with other entities, including
Montrose Capital, will locate a business combination target. We expect that funds in the amount of approximately 40,000 will be required
in order for the Company to satisfy its Exchange Act reporting requirements during the next 12 months, in addition to any other funds
that will be required in order to complete a business combination. Such funds can only be estimated upon identifying a business combination
target. Our management and stockholders have indicated an intent to advance funds on behalf of the Company as needed in order to accomplish
its business plan and comply with its Exchange Act reporting requirements, however, there are no agreements in effect between the Company
and our management or stockholders specifically requiring they provide any funds to the Company. Therefore, there are no assurances that
the Company will be able to obtain the required financing as needed in order to consummate a business combination transaction.

Recent Development - Proposed Merger 

On October 2, 2024, the Company filed with the
SEC a Schedule 14F-1 Information Statement relating to an anticipated change in the composition of its board of directors that is expected
to occur in connection with a proposed merger to be completed by and among the Company, a recently formed wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company Merger Sub ), and Lomond Therapeutics, a privately held Delaware corporation Lomond ), pursuant to
which Merger Sub would merge with and into Lomond, with Lomond continuing as the surviving entity (the Merger and as the
Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, after which the Company would continue the business of Lomond. The Merger would occur pursuant
to an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization expected to be entered into by and among the Company, Lomond and Merger Sub (the
 Merger Agreement) ). 

Lomond is a biopharmaceutical company focused
on the discovery and development of multiple product candidates to address hematological malignancies, including a pan-FLT3/IRAK4 inhibitor
for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia AML ), a BCL-2 inhibitor for the treatment of AML and chronic lymphocytic leukemia,
and an early-stage menin inhibitor for the treatment of AML. Lomond is headquartered in Dover, DE. 

Pursuant to the terms of the proposed Merger Agreement,
it is expected that all outstanding equity interest of Lomond will be converted into shares of our Common Stock, such that the holders
of Lomond equity before the proposed Merger will own a majority of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock after the Merger (before
giving effect to a potential private placement offering of Common Stock by the Company that we expect will be consummated simultaneously
with or immediately after the proposed Merger), resulting in a change of control of the Company. Completion of a private placement financing
is expected to be a condition to completion of the Merger. 

Certain other information regarding the proposed
Merger and proposed changes to the management and share ownership of the Company is set forth in the Schedule 14F-1. 

The foregoing description of the proposed Merger
Agreement and potential Common Stock private placement and related matters does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety
by the terms of the actual Merger Agreement and of terms and documentation for a private placement, none of which has yet been completed
and executed. The proposed Merger is expected to be subject to satisfaction of a number of other conditions precedent, and there can be
no assurance that the Merger Agreement will be signed or that the Merger or Common Stock private placement will be consummated or other
such conditions satisfied. If and when the Merger Agreement is signed, it will be further described in and filed by the Company with the
SEC as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K. If and when a Common Stock private placement is consummated, it will be further descried
in, and material agreements relating thereto will be filed by the Company with the SEC as exhibits to a Current Report on Form 8-K. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had total
assets equal to 2,269 and was comprised exclusively of cash. The Company s current liabilities as of September 30, 2024 totaled
 138,200 and was comprised of accounts payable and accrued expenses and amounts due under a note payable to a stockholder. The Company
can provide no assurance that it can continue to satisfy its cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. 

The following is a summary of the Company s
cash flows provided by (used in) operating and financing activities: 

For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 

2024 
 2023 
 
 Net Cash Used In Operating Activities 
 (33,715 
 (35,492 
 
 Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities 
 35,000 
 37,380 
 
 Net Change in Cash

 1,888 

The Company has only cash assets and has generated
no revenues since inception. The Company is also dependent upon the receipt of capital investment or other financing to fund its ongoing
operations and to execute its business plan of seeking a combination with a private operating company. In addition, the Company is dependent
upon certain related parties to provide continued funding and capital resources. If continued funding and capital resources are unavailable
at reasonable terms, the Company may not be able to implement its plan of operations.

Issuance of Promissory Note to a Stockholder and Director 

On September 24, 2021, in connection with advances
made in connection with costs incurred by the Company, the Company issued a promissory note to Mark Tompkins, a stockholder and director
of the Company, pursuant to which the Company agreed to repay Mr. Tompkins the sum of any and all amounts that Mr. Tompkins may advance
to the Company on or before the date that the Company consummates a business combination with a private company or reverse takeover transaction
or other transaction after which the Company would cease to be a shell company (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act). The
Company has used the proceeds from the note to cover its expenses. Although Mr. Tompkins has no obligation to advance funds to the Company
under the terms of the note, it is anticipated that he may advance funds to the Company as fees and expenses are incurred in the future.
As a result, the Company issued the note in anticipation of such advances. Interest shall not accrue on the outstanding principal amount
of the note except if an Event of Default (as defined in the note) has occurred. In the event of an Event of Default, the entire note
shall automatically become due and payable (the Default Date and starting from five (5) days after the Default Date, the
interest rate on the note shall accrue at the rate of eighteen percent (18 per annum. As of September 30, 2024, the total amount due
under the note was 127,500. 

Results of Operations 

The Company has not conducted any active operations
since inception, except for its efforts to locate suitable acquisition candidates. No revenue has been generated by the Company for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024. It is unlikely the Company will have any revenues unless it is able to effect an acquisition or
merger with an operating company, of which there can be no assurance. It is management s assertion that these circumstances may
hinder the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s plan of operation for the next twelve months shall
be to continue its efforts to locate suitable acquisition candidates. 

For the
three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company had a net loss of 10,953 and 10,870, respectively, and for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had a net loss of 33,715 and 36,825 , respectively, comprised of accounting, audit
and other professional service fees incurred in relation to the preparation and filing of the Company s SEC filings and general
and administrative expenses. 

In the next 12 months, we expect to incur expenses
equal to approximately 40,000 related to legal, accounting, audit, and other professional service fees incurred in relation to the Company s
Exchange Act filing requirements. The costs related to the acquisition of a business combination target company vary widely and are dependent
on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the amount of time it takes to complete a business combination, the location of
the target company, the size and complexity of the business of the target company, whether stockholders of the Company prior to the transaction
will retain equity in the Company, the scope of the due diligence investigation required, the involvement of the Company s auditors
in the transaction, possible changes in the Company s capital structure in connection with the transaction, and whether funds may
be raised contemporaneously with the transaction. Therefore, we believe such costs are unascertainable until the Company identifies a
business combination target. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The Company is
currently devoting its efforts to locating merger candidates. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon our ability to develop additional sources of capital, locate and complete a merger with another company, and ultimately, achieve
profitable operations. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The Company does not have any off-balance sheet
arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company s financial condition, changes
in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material
to investors. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Accounting estimates are an integral part of the
financial statements prepared by management and are based on management s knowledge and experience about past and current events
and assumptions about future events. Management s estimate of the current portion of note payable - stockholder is based on the
possibility that within one year of the balance sheet date a transaction will occur that requires the Company to repay the note payable.
Management s estimate of the deferred tax benefit arising from the net operating loss carry forwards available to reduce future
federal and state taxable income and the related valuation allowance in the same amount assumes that the Company will be acquired by a
target company and the benefit will not be realized.

Emerging Growth Company 

As an emerging growth company under
the JOBS Act, the Company has elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under
Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different
effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial
statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 

As a smaller reporting company as
defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed
with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Form
10-Q, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Internal controls are procedures which are designed with the objective of providing reasonable assurance that (1) our transactions are
properly authorized, recorded and reported; and (2) our assets are safeguarded against unauthorized or improper use, to permit the preparation
of our condensed financial statements in conformity with GAAP. 

In connection with the preparation of this Form
10-Q, management, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based
upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive and Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective,
as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. 

Changes in Internal Controls 

There have been no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange
Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations of the Effectiveness of Control 

A control system, no matter how well conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent
limitations of any control system, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a
company have been detected.
