 We differentiate ourselves from our competitors by offering very efficient light fixtures (measured in lumens per watt) coupled with our project management services to national account customers to retrofit their multiple locations. Our comprehensive services include initial site surveys and audits, utility incentive and government subsidy management, engineering design, and project management from delivery through to installation and controls integration and commissioning. In addition, we began to offer lighting and electrical maintenance services in fiscal 2021. We believe that providing these services enables us to support a long-term business relationship with our customers and results in an increase in our recurring revenue. We completed the acquisition of Stay-Lite Lighting on January 1, 2022, which was intended to further expand our maintenance services capabilities. We subsequently dissolved the Stay-Lite business and merged the net assets into Orion effective October 1, 2024. On October 5, 2022, we acquired Voltrek, which was intended to leverage our project management and maintenance expertise into the rapidly growing EV sector. 
 20 

Our lighting products consist primarily of LED lighting fixtures, many of which include IoT enabled control systems provided by third parties. We believe the market for LED lighting products continues to grow. Due to their size and flexibility in application, we also believe that LED lighting systems can address opportunities for retrofit applications that cannot be satisfied by other lighting technologies. 
 We generally do not have long-term contracts with our customers for product or turnkey services that provide us with recurring annual revenue. However, our maintenance services contracts usually consist of multi-year arrangements. We typically generate substantially all of our lighting revenue from sales of lighting systems and related services to governmental, commercial and industrial customers on a project-by-project basis. We also perform work under global services or product purchasing agreements with major customers with sales completed on a purchase order basis. The loss of, or substantial reduction in sales to, any of our significant customers, or our current single largest customer, or the termination or delay of a significant volume of purchase orders by one or more key customers, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any given future period. 
 We typically sell our lighting systems in replacement of our customers existing lighting fixtures. We call this replacement process a "retrofit". We frequently sell our products and services directly to our customers and in many cases we provide design and installation services as well as project management services. We also sell our lighting systems on a wholesale basis, principally to electrical distributors, electrical contractors and ESCOs which then resell to their own customers. 
 The gross margins of our products can vary significantly depending upon the types of products we sell, with gross margins typically ranging from 10 to 50 . As a result, a change in the total mix of our sales among higher or lower gross margin products can cause our profitability to fluctuate from period to period. 
 Our fiscal year ends on March 31. We refer to our current fiscal year which ends on March 31, 2025 as "fiscal 2025". We refer to our most recently completed fiscal year, which ended on March 31, 2024, as fiscal 2024 , and our prior fiscal year which ended on March 31, 2023 as "fiscal 2023". Our fiscal first quarter of each fiscal year ends on June 30, our fiscal second quarter ends on September 30, our fiscal third quarter ends on December 31, and our fiscal fourth quarter ends on March 31. 
 Reportable segments are components of an entity that have separate financial data that the entity's chief operating decision maker ("CODM") regularly reviews when allocating resources and assessing performance. Orion's CODM is the chief executive officer. Orion evaluates and reports on the business using three segments: Lighting Segment, Maintenance Segment and Electric Vehicle Charging Segment EV Segment ).

 Revenue, Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin. Product revenue decreased 20.7 , or 3.2 million, for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 versus the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Service revenue increased 39.9 , or 2.0 million, for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 versus the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The resulting decrease in total revenue was due to decreased revenues in the Lighting segment, partially offset by increased revenue in the EV segment. Cost of product revenue decreased by 18.4 , or 2.0 million, in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 versus the comparable period in fiscal 2024. Cost of service revenue increased by 17.2 , or 0.9 million, in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 versus the comparable period in fiscal 2024. Gross margin increased from 22.2 of revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 to 23.1 in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, due primarily to increased margins in the maintenance segment. 
 Operating Expenses 
 General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased 9.4 , or 0.5 million, in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024. This comparative decrease was primarily due to a decrease in Voltrek earn out expense to 0.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 1.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses decreased 14.0 , or 0.5 million, in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024. This comparative decrease was primarily due to the lower volume of product sales resulting in lower commissions expense. 
 Research and Development. Research and development expenses decreased 14.1 , or 0.1 million, in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024.

Lighting segment revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 decreased by 20.1 , or 2.7 million compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease in lighting segment revenue was due to variability in the timing of larger lighting projects along with the completion of the United States Department of Defense project in Germany. The decrease in operating loss in this segment was a result of an increased percentage of product revenue, which has a higher gross margin than service revenue. 
 Maintenance S egment 
 Our maintenance segment provides retailers, distributors and other businesses with maintenance, repair and replacement services for the lighting and related electrical components deployed in their facilities.

NM - Not Meaningful 

Revenue, Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin. Product revenue decreased 14.1 , or 4.1 million, for the first six months of fiscal 2025 versus the first six months of fiscal 2024. Service revenue increased 58.1 , or 5.2 million, for the first six months of fiscal 2025 versus the first six months of fiscal 2024. Total revenue increased due to growth in the EV segment, which was partially offset due to a decrease in the Lighting and Maintenance segments. Cost of product revenue decreased by 16.8 , or 3.5 million, in the first six months of fiscal 2025 versus the comparable period in fiscal 2024. Cost of service revenue increased by 37.5 , or 3.6 million, in the first six months of fiscal 2025 versus the comparable period in fiscal 2024. Gross margin increased from 20.3 of revenue in the first six months of fiscal 2024 to 22.3 in the first six months of fiscal 2025, due primarily to increased margins within the Maintenance segment. 
 Operating Expenses 
 General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased 15.6 , or 1.7 million, in the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to the first six months of fiscal 2024. This comparative decrease was primarily due to the decreased accrual of the expected Voltrek earn-out payment. 
 Acquisition Related Costs. There were no acquisition related costs in the first six months of fiscal 2025 in comparison to the 0.1 million in the first six months of fiscal 2024. 
 Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses decreased 12.5 , or 0.8 million, in the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to the first six months of fiscal 2024. This comparative decrease was primarily due to decreased commission expenses. 
 24 

Research and Development. Research and development expenses decreased 31.3 , or 0.3 million, in the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to the first six months of fiscal 2024. This comparative decrease was primarily due to the reduction of employee compensation costs. 
 Interest Expense. Interest expenses increased 48.1 or 0.2 million, in the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to the first six months of fiscal 2024. This comparative increase was primarily due to the interest on outstanding borrowings and a higher incremental borrowing rate.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 We believe our existing cash and operating cash flow provide us with the financial flexibility needed to meet our capital requirements, including to fund targeted our budgeted capital expenditures and working capital needs for at least one year from the date of this report, as well as our longer-term capital requirements for periods beyond at least one year from the date of this report. 
 We had approximately 5.4 million in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, compared to 5.2 million at March 31, 2024. Our cash position increased as a result of our newly obtained mortgage loan largely offset by an operating loss, a 1 million repayment of debt, and a net use of working capital during the first two quarters of fiscal 2025. 
 Our future liquidity needs and forecasted cash flows are dependent upon many factors, including our relative revenue, gross margins, cash management practices, cost containment, working capital management and capital expenditures. While we believe that we will likely have adequate available cash and equivalents and credit availability under our Credit Agreement to satisfy our currently anticipated working capital and liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months based on our current cash flow forecast, if we experience significant liquidity constraints, we may be required to issue equity or debt securities, reduce our sales efforts, implement additional cost savings initiatives or undertake other efforts to conserve our cash. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

Cash Flows Related to Operating Activities. Cash used in operating activities primarily consisted of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, amortization of debt issue costs, provisions for reserves, and the effect of changes in working capital and other activities. 
 Cash used in operating activities for the first six months of fiscal 2025 was 2.5 million and consisted of our net loss of 7.4 million adjusted for non-cash expense items and net cash provided in changes in operating assets of 4.9 million, the largest of which was a 3.9 million decrease in accounts payable, which was mostly offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories. 
 Cash used in operating activities for the first six months of fiscal 2024 was 11.3 million and consisted of our net loss of 11.1 million adjusted for non-cash expense items and net cash used in changes in operating assets of 0.2 million, the largest of which was a 2.6 million increase in accounts receivable. 
 Cash Flows Related to Investing Activities . Cash provided by investing activities of 155 thousand in the first six months of fiscal 2025 consisted primarily of sales of property and equipment. 
 Cash used in investing activities of 0.6 million in the first six months of fiscal 2024 consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by proceeds from sale of property and equipment. 
 Cash Flows Related to Financing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities of 2.5 million in the first six months of fiscal 2025 was primarily due to the term loan discussed in Note 12 above, which was partially offset by payments on the revolving credit facility and long-term debt. 
 26 

Cash used by financing activities of 5 thousand in the first six months of fiscal 2024 consisted primarily of payment of long-term debt. 
 Working Capital 
 Our net working capital as of September 30, 2024 was 13.1 million, consisting of 40.0 million in current assets and 26.9 million in current liabilities. Our net working capital as of March 31, 2024 was 16.7 million, consisting of 44.8 million in current assets and 28.1 million in current liabilities. 
 We generally attempt to maintain at least a three-month supply of on-hand inventory of purchased components and raw materials to meet anticipated demand, as well as to reduce our risk of unexpected raw material or component shortages or supply interruptions. Our accounts receivables, inventory, payables and unbilled revenue may increase to the extent our revenue and order levels increase.	 
 Indebtedness 
 Revolving Credit Agreement 
 Our credit agreement provides for a five-year 25.0 million revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility that matures on December 29, 2025. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are subject to a borrowing base requirement based on eligible receivables, inventory and cash. As of September 30, 2024, the borrowing base supported approximately 16.7 million of availability under the Credit Facility with 9.0 million drawn against that availability. As of September 30, 2023, the borrowing base supported approximately 18.9 million of availability under the Credit Facility with 10.0 million drawn against that availability. 
 The credit agreement is secured by a first lien security interest in substantially all of our assets. 
 Borrowings under the credit agreement are permitted in the form of SOFR or prime rate-based loans and generally bear interest at floating rates plus an applicable margin determined by reference to our availability under the Credit Agreement. Among other fees, we are required to pay an annual facility fee of 15,000 and a fee of 25 basis points on the unused portion of the Credit Facility. 
 The credit agreement includes a springing minimum fixed cost coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 when excess availability under the Credit Facility falls below the greater of 3.0 million or 15 of the committed facility. Currently, the required springing minimum fixed cost coverage ratio is not required. 
 The credit agreement also contains customary events of default and other covenants, including certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, consolidate or merge, enter into acquisitions, pay any dividend or distribution on our stock, redeem, retire or purchase shares of our stock, make investments or pledge or transfer assets. If an event of default under the credit agreement occurs and is continuing, then the lender may cease making advances under the credit agreement and declare any outstanding obligations under the credit agreement to be immediately due and payable. In addition, if we become the subject of voluntary or involuntary proceedings under any bankruptcy or similar law, then any outstanding obligations under the credit agreement will automatically become immediately due and payable. 
 Effective April 22, 2024, we, along with the lender, executed Amendment No. 2 Amendment No. 2 to the credit agreement. The primary purpose of Amendment No. 2 was to add a 3.525 million mortgage loan facility to the credit agreement secured by our office headquarters property in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. Amendment No. 2 also broadened the definition of receivables to encompass government receivables as being eligible to be included in our borrowing base calculation for the purpose of establishing our monthly borrowing availability under the credit agreement. Quarterly installments of 88,125 are due on the first day of each fiscal quarter beginning October 1, 2024. 
 As discussed in Note 19 - Subsequent Events, the maturity date of the Credit Facility was extended from December 29, 2025 to June 30, 2027. 
 27 

Backlog 
 Backlog represents the amount of revenue that we expect to realize in the future as a result of firm, committed purchase orders. Backlog totaled 11.1 million and 22.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. We generally expect our backlog to be recognized as revenue within one year. Backlog does not include any amounts for contracted maintenance services. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and our related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We re-evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to revenue recognition, inventory valuation, stock-based compensation and income taxes. The estimates of forecasted cash flows are used in the assessment for impairment of long-lived assets and the realizability of deferred tax assets. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. A summary of our critical accounting policies is set forth in the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes in our accounting policies.

ITEM 3.	QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Our exposure to market risk was discussed in the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk section contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024. There have been no material changes to such exposures since March 31, 2024. 
 ITEM 4.	CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
