Although
we believe that we have a reasonable basis for each forward-looking statement contained in this Quarterly Report, we caution you that
these statements are based on our projections of the future that are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors
that may cause our actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements,
to differ. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements, and you should
not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary
statement. Forward-looking statements should be regarded solely as our current plans, estimates and beliefs. You should read this Quarterly
Report and the documents that we have filed as exhibits to this Quarterly Report and incorporated by reference herein completely and
with the understanding that our actual results may be materially different from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the
forward-looking statements we make. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment and new risks emerge
from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business
or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any
forward-looking statements we may make. The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report are made as of the date of
this Quarterly Report, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
future events, or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. 

This
Quarterly Report contains estimates and other statistical data made by independent parties and by the Company relating to market size
and growth and other data about its industry. This data involves a number of assumptions and limitations, and you are cautioned not to
give undue weight to such estimates. 

Our
first commercial product, Phexxi, was approved by the FDA on May 22, 2020, for the prevention of pregnancy. Phexxi is the first and only non-hormonal prescription contraceptive
gel. Women use it when they have sex, applying Phexxi 0-60 minutes prior to intercourse. Because Phexxi is hormone-free and non-systemic, it is not associated with side effects of
hormonal contraceptive methods such as depression, weight gain, headaches, loss of libido, mood swings and irritability. Taking hormones
may not be right for some women, especially those with certain medical conditions, including clotting disorders, hormone-sensitive cancers,
diabetes or a BMI over 30, as well as women who are breast feeding, and / or smoke. More than 23.3 million women in the U.S. do not want
to get pregnant and will not use a hormonal contraceptive. 

We
have delivered Phexxi net sales growth in each consecutive year since it was launched in September 2020. Key growth drivers for 2024
include expanded use of Phexxi in women who take oral birth control pills in conjunction with GLP-1 prescription medications like Ozempic,
Mounjaro, and Zepbound for weight loss. These drugs may make oral birth control pills less effective at certain points in the dosing
schedule. Per the USPI, prescribers are counselled to advise patients using oral contraceptives to switch to a non-oral contraceptive
method or add a barrier method to prevent unintended pregnancy during these times. 

Outside
the U.S., the Company s strategy is to commercialize Phexxi in global markets through commercial partnerships and/or license agreements.
Phexxi was approved in Nigeria on October 6, 2022, as Femidence by the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control.
Phexxi has been submitted for approval in Mexico, Ethiopia and Ghana. In July 2024, we licensed commercial rights to Phexxi in the Middle
East to Pharma 1 Drug Store, LLC, an emerging Emirati health care company (Pharma 1). Pharma 1 intends to file for regulatory approval
of Phexxi in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in the fourth quarter of 2024. 

In
July 2024 we acquired global rights to SOLOSEC. This FDA-approved single-dose oral antimicrobial agent provides a complete course of
therapy for the treatment of two common sexual health infections bacterial vaginosis (BV) and trichomoniasis (Trich). The SOLOSEC
acquisition aligns with and advances our mission to improve access to innovative and differentiated options that impact
women s daily lives. We expect commercialization of SOLOSEC will benefit from our commercial infrastructure and strong
physician relationships. 

Unless
the context requires otherwise, references in this Quarterly Report to Evofem, Company, we, 
 us and our refer to Evofem Biosciences, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 

This
Quarterly Report includes our trademarks, trade names and service marks, including Phexxi , Femidence 
and SOLOSEC , which are protected under applicable intellectual property laws and are the property of Evofem Biosciences,
Inc. or its subsidiaries. Solely for convenience, trademarks, trade names and service marks referred to in this Quarterly Report may
appear without the , or SM symbols, but such references are not intended to indicate, in any way, that we will not assert,
to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights or the right of the applicable licensor to these trademarks, trade names and service
marks. We do not intend our use or display of other parties trademarks, trade names or service marks to imply, and such use or
display should not be construed to imply a relationship with, or endorsement or sponsorship of us by, these other parties.

million in 2022 and increased to million in
2023. 

On
December 11, 2023, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, as amended, (the Merger Agreement) with Aditxt, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (Aditxt) and Adifem, Inc. (f/k/a Adicure, Inc.), a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Aditxt
(Merger Sub), respectively, (collectively, the Parties), pursuant to which, and on the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, the
Merger Sub is expected to merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Aditxt (the Merger).
The Parties entered into an amended and restated Merger Agreement (the A R Merger Agreement) in July 2024 and subsequently amended
the A R Merger Agreement in August, September, and October 2024. The parties are working towards a closing in 2025. 

On July 14,
2024, the Company acquired global rights to SOLOSEC (secnidazole) 2g oral granules. This FDA-approved single-dose oral
antimicrobial agent provides a complete course of therapy for the treatment of two common sexual health infections bacterial
vaginosis (BV) and trichomoniasis. This acquisition aligns with and advances the Company s mission to commercialize innovative
and differentiated products for women s sexual and reproductive health. The Transferred Assets, as defined in the SOLOSEC
Asset Purchase Agreement, included all registered intellectual property related to SOLOSEC (SOLOSEC IP) as well as assorted SOLOSEC
related documentation and contracts. The Company accounted for this acquisition as an asset acquisition, pursuant to which the
Company recorded contingent liabilities for the fair value of future sales-based payments and an intangible asset for the fair value
of the SOLOSEC IP plus certain transaction costs; see Note 6 Fair
Value of Financial Instruments and Note 7 Commitments and Contingencies for
more detailed information about the asset acquisition accounting and fair value methodology. 

Basis
of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation 

The
Company prepared the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted (GAAP) in the United States for interim financial information and the rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) related to quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. 

The
Company s financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis, which include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The unaudited interim condensed consolidated
financial statements do not include all information and disclosures required by GAAP for annual audited financial statements and should
be read in conjunction with the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December
31, 2023 included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on March 27, 2024 (the 2023 Audited Financial Statements). 

The
unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report have been prepared on the same basis as the Company s
audited consolidated financial statements and include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for
a fair statement of the financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and statements of convertible and redeemable preferred
stock and stockholders deficit for the periods presented. The results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are
not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023
was derived from the 2023 Audited Financial Statements. 

Risks,
Uncertainties and Going Concern 

Any
disruptions in the commercialization of Phexxi or SOLOSEC and/or their supply chains could have a material adverse effect on the
Company s business, results of operations and financial condition. 

The
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and settlement of liabilities, in the normal course of business, and does not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future
effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome
of this uncertainty. 

The
Company s principal operations are related to the commercialization of Phexxi and SOLOSEC, following its acquisition in July
2024. Additional activities have included raising capital, identifying alternative manufacturing to lower Phexxi cost of goods sold
(COGS), seeking ex-U.S. licensing partners to add non-dilutive capital to the balance sheet, seeking product
in-licensing/acquisition opportunities to expand and diversify the U.S. revenue stream, and establishing and maintaining a corporate
infrastructure to support a commercial product. The Company has incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operating
activities since inception. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a working capital deficit of 
million and an accumulated deficit of 
million. 

Since
October 3, 2022, the Company s common stock has traded on the OTC Venture Market (the OTCQB) of the OTC Markets Group, Inc.
(the OTC), a centralized electronic quotation service for over-the-counter securities, under the symbol EVFM. The
OTCQB imposes, among other requirements, a minimum 
per share bid price requirement (the Bid Price Requirement) for continued inclusion on the OTCQB. The closing bid price for the
Company s common stock must remain at or above 
per share to comply with the Bid Price Requirement for continued listing. The Company received a written notice (the OTC Notice),
dated August 28, 2024, from the OTC notifying the Company that, because the closing bid price for the Company s common stock
was below per share for 30
consecutive trading days, the Company was not in compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement for continued listing on
OTCQB as set forth in the OTCQB listing standards, section 2.3 (the Minimum Bid Price Requirement). The OTC Notice had no immediate
effect on the listing of the Company s common stock on OTCQB. In accordance with OTCQB Listing Standards, Section 4.1 the
Company had a compliance period of 90 days, or until November 26, 2024, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement.
On November 8, 2024, the OTC notified the Company that the Company s closing bid price was equal to or greater than 
for the preceding ten consecutive days and therefore the Company had regained compliance with the OTCQB listing standards and the
matter is rectified as of November 7, 2024. As of November 8, 2024, the closing bid
price was . 

Management s
plans to meet its cash flow needs in the next 12 months include generating recurring product revenue from Phexxi and SOLOSEC,
restructuring its current payables, and obtaining additional funding through means such as the issuance of preferred stock to Aditxt
as was done under the A R Merger Agreement, as amended, non-dilutive financings, or through collaborations or partnerships
with other companies, including license agreements for Phexxi and/or SOLOSEC in the U.S. or foreign markets, or other potential business combinations. 

The
Company anticipates it will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. According to management estimates, liquidity resources
as of September 30, 2024 were not sufficient to maintain the Company s cash flow needs for the twelve months from the date of issuance
of these condensed consolidated financial statements. 

If
the Company is not able to obtain the required funding through a significant increase in revenue, equity or debt financings, license
agreements for Phexxi and/or SOLOSEC, or other means, or is unable to obtain funding on terms favorable to the Company, or if there
is another event of default affecting the notes payable, or if the Company is enjoined from using the Phexxi mark, there will be a
material adverse effect on commercialization operations and the Company s ability to execute its strategic development plan
for future growth. If the Company cannot successfully raise additional funding and implement its strategic development plan, the
Company may be forced to make further reductions in spending, including spending in connection with its commercialization
activities, extend payment terms with suppliers, liquidate assets where possible at a potentially lower amount than as recorded in
the condensed consolidated financial statements, suspend or curtail planned operations, or cease operations entirely. Any of these
could materially and adversely affect the Company s liquidity, financial condition and business prospects, and the Company
would not be able to continue as a going concern. The Company has concluded that these circumstances and the uncertainties
associated with the Company s ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing on terms that are favorable to the
Company, or at all, and otherwise succeed in its future operations raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to
continue as a going concern. 

and
 of its gross product sales, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company s three largest
customers combined made up approximately and of its gross product sales, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023, the Company s three largest customers combined made up and , respectively, of its trade accounts receivable
balance. 

million for the Company s fleet leases were released. Upon receipt of a
notice of default from its landlord on March 20, 2023, for failing to pay March 2023 rent timely resulting in a breach under the office
lease agreement, the Company s letter of credit in the amount of million in restricted cash was recovered by the landlord. 

Additionally,
the remaining funds of the million received from the issuance of Adjuvant Notes (as defined below) in the fourth quarter of 2020
are classified as restricted cash since the Company is contractually obligated to use these funds for specific purposes. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company s cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the
condensed consolidated statements of cash flows include restricted cash only. 

million in the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2024, respectively and zero in each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) by the
weighted-average number of common shares and potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the period determined using the
treasury-stock and if-converted methods. For purposes of the diluted net loss per share calculation, potentially dilutive securities
are excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive; therefore, basic and
diluted net loss per share were the same for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Potentially dilutive
securities excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share are summarized in the table below. Common shares were calculated
for the convertible preferred stock and the convertible debt using the if-converted method.

Patient
support programs The Company voluntarily offers a co-pay program to provide financial assistance to patients meeting certain
eligibility requirements. The Company estimates the amount of financial assistance for these programs based on the expected number of
claims and related cost associated with the revenue being recognized for product that remains in the distribution channel at the end
of each reporting period. Patient support programs estimates are recorded as other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated
balance sheets. 

Product
returns Customers have the right to return product that is within six months or less of the labeled expiration date or that
is past the expiration date by no more than twelve months. Phexxi was commercially launched in September 2020 with a 30-month shelf life.
The shelf life increased to 48 months in June 2022. SOLOSEC has a shelf life of 60 months. The Company uses historical sales and return
data to estimate future product returns. Product return estimates are recorded as other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated
balance sheets. 

The
variable considerations discussed above were recorded in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and consisted of million and
 million in contra trade accounts receivable as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and million and
 million in other current liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

million and (ii) warrants to purchase shares of common stock (the Baker Warrants) in
a private placement, which closed in two closings (April 24, 2020, the Baker Initial Closing, and June 9, 2020, the Baker Second Closing)
As a result of the two closings, the Company issued and sold Baker Notes with an aggregate principal amount of million and Baker
Warrants exercisable for shares of common stock. Upon the completion of the underwritten public offering in June 2020, the exercise
price of the Baker Warrants was per share. The Baker Warrants have a five-year term with a cashless exercise provision and are
immediately exercisable at any time from their respective issuance date. 

The
Baker Notes have a five-year term, with no pre-payment ability during the first three years. Interest on the unpaid principal balance
of the Baker Notes (the Baker Outstanding Balance) accrues at per annum, with interest accrued during the first year from the two
respective closing dates recognized as payment-in-kind. The effective interest rate for the period was . Accrued interest beyond
the first year of the respective closing dates is to be paid in arrears on a quarterly basis in cash or recognized as payment-in-kind,
at the direction of the Baker Purchasers. As discussed below, with the amendment to the Baker Bros. Purchase Agreement, interest payments
were paid in-kind. Interest pertaining to the Baker Notes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately million and million, respectively, which was added to the outstanding principal balance. Interest pertaining to the Baker Notes
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was approximately million and million, respectively, which was added
to the outstanding principal balance. The Company accounts for the Baker Notes under the fair value method as described below and, therefore,
the interest associated with the Baker Notes is included in the fair value determination. 

The
Baker Notes were callable by the Company on days written notice beginning on the third anniversary of the initial closing date
of April 24, 2020 at a call price equal to of the Baker Outstanding Balance plus accrued and unpaid interest if the Company s
common stock as measured using a 30-day volume weighted average price (VWAP) was greater than the benchmark price of as stated
in the Baker Bros. Purchase Agreement, or of the Baker Outstanding Balance plus accrued and unpaid interest if the VWAP was less
than such benchmark price. The Baker Purchasers also had the option to require the Company to repurchase all or any portion of the Baker
Notes in cash upon the occurrence of certain events. In a repurchase event, as defined in the Baker Bros. Purchase Agreement, the repurchase
price will equal of the Baker Outstanding Balance plus accrued and unpaid interest. In the event of default or the Company s
change of control, the repurchase price would equal to the sum of (x) three times of the Baker Outstanding Balance plus (y) the aggregate
value of future interest that would have accrued. The Baker Notes were convertible at any time at the option of the Baker Purchasers
at the conversion price of per share prior to the First and Second Baker Amendments (as defined below). 

On
November 20, 2021, the Company entered into the first amendment to the Baker Bros. Purchase Agreement (the First Baker Amendment), in
which each Baker Purchaser had the right to convert all or any portion of the Baker Notes into common stock at a conversion price equal
to the lesser of (a) and (b) of the lowest price per share of common stock (or, as applicable with respect to any equity
securities convertible into common stock, of the applicable conversion price) sold in one or more equity financings until the Company
has met a qualified financing threshold defined as one or more equity financings resulting in aggregate gross proceeds to the Company
of at least million (the Financing Threshold). 

The
First Baker Amendment extended, effective upon the Company s achievement of the Financing Threshold, the affirmative covenant
to achieve million in cumulative net sales of Phexxi by June 30, 2022 to June 30, 2023. Additionally per the First Baker Amendment,
if the Company were to issue warrants to purchase capital stock of the Company (or other similar consideration) in any equity financing
that closed on or prior to the date on which the Company met the Financing Threshold, the Company was required to issue to the Baker
Purchasers an equivalent coverage of warrants (or other similar consideration) on the same terms as if the Baker Purchasers had participated
in the financing in an amount equal to the then outstanding principal of Baker Notes held by the Baker Purchasers. In satisfaction of
this requirement and in connection with the closing of the May 2022 Public Offering, the Company issued warrants to purchase 
shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of per share to the Baker Purchasers (the June 2022 Baker Warrants).
As required by the terms of the First Baker Amendment, the June 2022 Baker Warrants have substantially the same terms as the warrants
issued in the May 2022 Public Offering. Refer to Note 8 Convertible and Redeemable Preferred Stock and Stockholders Deficit 
for further information. The exercise price of the initial Baker Warrants and the June 2022 Baker Warrants was reset multiple times as
a result of various Notes issuances in accordance with the agreement. The exercise price was per share as of September 30, 2024. 

On
March 21, 2022, the Company entered into the second amendment to the Baker Bros. Purchase Agreement (the Second Baker Amendment), which
granted each Baker Purchaser the right to convert all or any portion of the Baker Notes into common stock at a conversion price equal
to the lesser of (a) or (b) of the lowest price per share of common stock (or as applicable with respect to any equity securities
convertible into common stock, of the applicable conversion price) sold in any equity financing until the Company (i) met the qualified
financing threshold by June 30, 2022, defined as a single underwritten financing resulting in aggregate gross proceeds to the Company
of at least million (Qualified Financing Threshold) and (ii) disclosed top-line results from the EVOGUARD clinical trial (the
Clinical Trial Milestone) on or before October 31, 2022. The Second Baker Amendment also provided that the exercise price of the Baker
Warrants will equal the conversion price of the Baker Notes. The Company met the Qualified Financing Threshold upon the closing of the
May 2022 Public Offering, and as of September 30, 2022, the conversion price and exercise price of the Baker Warrants was reset to .
The Company achieved the Clinical Trial Milestone in October 2022. Also, with the achievement of the Qualified Financing Threshold and
the Clinical Trial Milestone, the affirmative covenant to achieve million in cumulative net sales of Phexxi was extended to June
30, 2023, which was subsequently waived via the Baker Fourth Amendment as discussed below. 

On
September 15, 2022, the Company entered into the third amendment to the Baker Bros. Purchase Agreement (the Third Baker Amendment), pursuant
to which the conversion price was amended to , subject to adjustment for certain dilutive Company equity issuance adjustments for
a two-year period; an interest make-whole payment due in certain circumstances was removed; and certain change of control and liquidation
payment amounts were reduced from three times the outstanding amounts of the Baker Notes to two times the outstanding amounts. In addition,
the Third Baker Amendment provided that the Company may make future interest payments to the Baker Purchasers in kind or in cash, at
the Company s option. On the same day, the Company also entered into a Secured Creditor Forbearance Agreement with the Baker Purchasers
(Forbearance Agreement), according to which the Baker Purchasers agreed to forebear the defaults that existed at that time. 

On
December 19, 2022, the Company entered into the First Amendment to the Forbearance Agreement (the Amendment) effective as of December
15, 2022 to amend certain provisions of the Forbearance Agreement dated September 15, 2022. The Amendment revised the Forbearance Agreement
to (i) amend the Fifth Recital Clause to clarify that the Purchasers consent to any additional indebtedness pari passu , but not
senior to that of the Purchasers, in an amount not to exceed million, and (ii) strike and entirely replace Section 4 to clarify
the terms of the Purchasers consent to Interim Financing (as defined therein). No other revisions were made to the Forbearance
Agreement. 

On
March 7, 2023, Baker Bros. Advisors, LP (the Designated Agent) provided a Notice of Event of Default and Reservation of Rights (the Notice
of Default) relating to the Baker Bros. Purchase Agreement. The Notice of Default claimed that the Company failed to maintain the Required
Reserve Amount as required by the Third Baker Amendment. The Designated Agent, at the direction of the Baker Purchasers, accelerated
repayment of the outstanding balance payable. As a result, approximately million, representing two times the sum of the outstanding
balance and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and all other amounts due under the Baker Bros. Purchase Agreement and other documents,
was due and payable within three business days of receipt of the Notice of Default. In addition, the Company did not meet the 
million cumulative net sales threshold by June 30, 2023 and as such was in default as of that date. As discussed below, all existing
defaults were cured upon the signing of the Fourth Baker Amendment. 

On
September 8, 2023, the Company entered into the Fourth Amendment to the Baker Bros. Purchase Agreement (the Fourth Baker Amendment) with
the Baker Purchasers. The Fourth Amendment amends certain provisions within the Baker Bros. Purchase Agreement including: 

(i)
 
 the
 rescission of the Notice of Default delivered to the Company on March 7, 2023 and waiver of the Events of Default named therein; 

(ii)
 
 the
 waiver of any and all other Events of Default existing as of the Fourth Amendment date; 

(iii)
 
 the
 removal of the conversion feature into shares of Company common stock, including the removal of any requirement to reserve shares
 of common stock for conversion of the Baker Notes as well as any registration rights related thereto; 

(iv) 
 the
 clarification that for the sole purpose of enabling ex-U.S. license agreements for such assets, any Patents, Trademarks or Copyrights
 acquired after the Effective Date shall be excluded from the definition of Collateral; and, 

(v)
 
 the
 removal of the requirement for the Company to achieve million in cumulative net Phexxi sales in the specified timeframe. 

The
outstanding balance of the Baker Notes will continue to accrue interest at per annum and, in the event of a default in the agreement
or a failure to pay the Repurchase Price (as defined below) on or before September 8, 2028 (the Maturity Date), the Baker Purchasers
may collect on the full principal amount then outstanding. 

The
Company paid the required million upfront payment in September 2023 and is required to make quarterly cash payments based upon a
percentage of the Company s global net product revenue. The cash payments will be determined based upon the quarterly global net
revenue of Phexxi according to the table below. 

> 5.0
 million and 7.0 million

The
cash payments were payable beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023 and have been timely paid. 

Regardless
of the percentage paid, the quarterly cash payment amounts, along with the 
million upfront payment, will be deducted from the Repurchase Price as Applicable Reductions. Quarterly cash payments that will be
treated as Applicable Reductions paid to date as of September 30, 2024 amount to 
million.

The
Company evaluated whether any of the Embedded Features required bifurcation as a separate component. The Company elected the fair value
option (FVO) under ASC 825, Financial Instruments (ASC 825), as the Baker Notes are qualified financial instruments and are, in
whole, classified as liabilities. Under the FVO, the Company recognized the debt instrument at fair value, inclusive of the Embedded
Features, with changes in fair value related to changes in the Company s credit risk being recognized as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive loss in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. All other changes in fair value were recognized in the condensed
consolidated statements of operations. 

Due
to the execution of the Fourth Baker Amendment, the Company reviewed the Baker Notes in accordance with ASC 470, Debt (ASC 470) .
 Because the Baker Notes were recorded under the FVO, the Fourth Amendment was outside the scope of ASC 470-60 and as such did not
qualify as a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). The Baker Notes were evaluated in accordance with ASC 470 and were determined to have
failed certain qualitative factors to qualify as a modification and, therefore, were accounted for as an extinguishment. The Company
removed the fair value of the old Baker Notes of million and the related accumulated other comprehensive income of million
as of the date of extinguishment and recorded the fair value of the new Baker Notes, as measured on the date of the Baker Fourth Amendment
as million, and recognized a gain of approximately million within the condensed consolidated statements of operations, in
the gain (loss) on debt extinguishment line item, upon extinguishment in the year ended December 31, 2023. The gain included
recognizing million that had previously been a component of other comprehensive income as part of the prior quarterly revaluations
using the valuation methods discussed in Note 6 Fair Value of Financial Instruments . 

As
part of the consideration for the Merger, on December 11, 2023, the Baker Purchasers signed an agreement to assign the Baker Notes to
Aditxt (the December Assignment Agreement). Upon execution of the December Assignment Agreement, Aditxt assumed all terms under the Baker Notes,
with Aditxt becoming the new senior secured debtholder of the Company, governed by the requirements under the Fourth Baker Amendment.
The Baker Notes were re-assigned back to the Baker Purchasers on February 26, 2024 (the February Assignment Agreement). 

Due
to the execution of the February Assignment Agreement, the Company reviewed the Baker Notes in accordance with ASC 470. The Baker Notes,
having been effectively terminated, were extinguished on February 26, 2024, resulting in removing the fair value of the old Baker Notes
of million. The newly re-assigned Baker Notes were subsequently recorded at fair value using the valuation methods discussed in
 Note 6 Fair Value of Financial Instruments . 

On
July 23, 2024, the Company consented to the transfer of ownership of the senior secured notes from Baker Brothers Life Sciences,
667, L.P., and Baker Bros. Advisors, LP, each a Delaware limited partnership (collectively, Baker) to Future Pak, LLC, a Michigan
limited liability company (the Assignee). The terms of the senior secured notes were not changed in connection with the assignment
from Baker to the Assignee. Due to the July 2024 assignment, the Company reviewed the Baker Notes in accordance with ASC 470. The
Baker Notes, having been effectively terminated, were extinguished on July 23, 2024, resulting in removing the fair value of the old
Baker Notes of 
million and the related accumulated other comprehensive income of 
million as of the date of the extinguishment. The Company also recognized a loss of approximately 
million within the condensed consolidated statements of operations, in the gain (loss) on debt extinguishment line item for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The newly
re-assigned Baker Notes were subsequently recorded at fair value using the valuation methods discussed in Note 6
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments . 

The
Company did not repurchase the Baker Notes prior to September 8, 2024 for a repurchase price of million
less applicable reductions. As of September 30, 2024, the Baker Notes are recorded at fair value in the condensed consolidated
balance sheet as short-term Notes carried at fair value with a total fair value of million,
and the total outstanding balance including principal and accrued interest is million.
As of December 31, 2023, the Baker Notes are recorded at fair value in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as short-term
convertible notes payable with a total balance of million,
and the total outstanding balance including principal and accrued interest is million.
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company paid a total of million
and million,
respectively, in required cash payments as described above. No such payments were required in the prior year. 

On September 27,
2024, the Assignee, as agent for the Purchasers (in such capacity, the Designated Agent) provided a Notice of Event of Default and
Reservation of Rights (the September 2024 Notice of Default) relating to the Securities Purchase and Security Agreement dated April
23, 2020, as amended, by and among the Company, Designated Agent, as certain guarantors and the purchasers (each a Purchaser and
collectively Purchasers). The September 2024 Notice of Default claims that by entering into arrangements to repay certain existing
obligations, including obligations owed to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, an Event of Default has occurred under
Section 9.1(e) of the SPA. 

According to the Notice of Default,
the Designated Agent has accelerated repayment of the outstanding principal balance owed by the Company under the Securities Purchase
Agreement. If all Purchasers exercise the Section 5.7 Option (as defined below), the repurchase price would be equal to the total outstanding
balance, including principal and accrued interest. Pursuant to Section 5.7(b) of the SPA, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default,
each Purchaser may elect, at its option, to require the Company to repurchase the Note held by such Purchaser (or any portion thereof)
at a repurchase price equal to two times the sum of the outstanding principal balance and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, due
within three business days after such Purchaser delivers a notice of such election (the Section 5.7 Option). 

On
October 27, 2024, the Designated Agent sent an amended and supplemented notice to the Initial Notice of Default (the Amended Notice of
Default) which adds new claims of default based on the Company s current repayment agreements of existing obligations, including
obligations owed to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, an Event of Default has occurred under Section 9.1(e) of the Baker
Bros. Purchase Agreement, as amended. Furthermore, the Amended Notice stated that, because the events of default described in the Amended
Notice of Default are not the certain prior events of default listed in the Forbearance Agreement (Specified Defaults), the Designated
Agent and the holders of the senior secured promissory notes described in the SPA thereby provided notice to the Company that the Forbearance
Agreement is terminated as of October 27, 2024. 

On November 8, 2024, . 

The Company strongly disagrees
with the Designated Agent s claim that an Event of Default has occurred. The Company intends to vigorously contest any attempt by
the Designated Agent and the Purchasers to exercise their default rights and remedies under the SPA. 

Adjuvant
Notes 

On
October 14, 2020, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Adjuvant Purchase Agreement) with Adjuvant Global Health
Technology Fund, L.P., and Adjuvant Global Health Technology Fund DE, L.P. (together, the Adjuvant Purchasers), pursuant to which the
Company sold unsecured convertible promissory notes (the Adjuvant Notes) in aggregate principal amount of million. 

The
Adjuvant Notes have a five-year term and, in connection with certain Company change of control transactions, the Adjuvant Notes may be
prepaid at the option of the Company or will become payable on the date of the consummation of a change of control transaction at the
option of the Adjuvant Purchasers. The Adjuvant Notes accrue interest at per annum on a quarterly basis in arrears to the outstanding
balance of the Adjuvant Notes and are recognized as payment-in-kind. The effective interest rate for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 was .

The
Adjuvant Notes are convertible, subject to customary and beneficial ownership limitations, into shares of the Company s
common stock, par value per share, at any time at the option of the Adjuvant Purchasers at a conversion price of per
share. In connection with certain Company change of control transactions, the Adjuvant Notes may be prepaid at the option of the Company
or will become payable at the option of the Adjuvant Purchasers. To the extent not previously prepaid or converted, the Adjuvant Notes
were originally automatically convertible into shares of the Company s common stock at a conversion price of per share
immediately following the earliest of the time at which the (i) 30-day value-weighted average price of the Company s common stock
was per share, or (ii) the Company achieved cumulative net sales of million, provided such net sales were achieved prior
to July 1, 2022. 

On
April 4, 2022, the Company entered into the first amendment to the Adjuvant Purchase Agreement (the Adjuvant Amendment). The Adjuvant
Amendment extended the affirmative covenant to achieve million in cumulative net sales of Phexxi by June 30, 2022 to June 30,
2023. The Adjuvant Amendment also provided for an adjustment to the conversion price of the Adjuvant Notes such that the conversion price
(the Conversion Price) for these Notes, effective as of the May 2023 reverse stock split, will now be the lesser of (i) and (ii)
 of the lowest price per share of common stock (or with respect to securities convertible into common stock, of the applicable
conversion price) sold in any equity financing until the Company met the Qualified Financing Threshold. Effective as of the Company s
achievement of the Qualified Financing Threshold, the automatic conversion provisions in the Agreement were further amended to provide
that the Adjuvant Notes will automatically convert into shares of the Company s common stock at the Conversion Price immediately
following the earliest of the time at which the (i) -day value-weighted average price of the Company s common stock is 
per share, or (ii) the Company achieves cumulative net sales of Phexxi of million, provided such net sales were achieved prior
to July 1, 2023. 

The
Adjuvant Notes contain various customary affirmative and negative covenants agreed to by the Company. On September 12, 2022, the Company
was in default of the Adjuvant Notes due to the default with the Baker Notes under the cross-default provision. On September 15, 2022,
the Company entered into a Forbearance Agreement (the Adjuvant Forbearance Agreement) with the Adjuvant Purchasers, pursuant to which
the Adjuvant Purchasers agreed to forbear from exercising any of their rights and remedies during the Forbearance Period as defined in
therein, but solely with respect to the specified events of default provided under the Adjuvant Forbearance Agreement. 

On
September 15, 2022, the Company also entered into the second amendment to the Adjuvant Purchase Agreement (the Second Adjuvant Amendment),
pursuant to which the conversion price per share was reduced to , subject to adjustment for certain dilutive Company equity issuance
adjustments for a two-year period. In addition, the Company entered into an exchange agreement, pursuant to which the Adjuvant Purchasers
agreed to exchange of the outstanding amount of the Adjuvant Notes as of September 15, 2022 (or million) for rights to receive
 shares of common stock (the Adjuvant Purchase Rights). The number of shares for each Adjuvant Purchase Right was initially fixed,
but is subject to certain customary adjustments, and, until the second anniversary of issuance (i.e., October 14, 2022), adjustments
for certain dilutive Company equity issuances. Refer to Note 8 Convertible and Redeemable Preferred Stock and Stockholders Deficit for discussion regarding additional issuances of purchase rights under this provision. The Adjuvant Purchase Rights expire on
June 28, 2027 and do not have an exercise price per share and, therefore, will not result in cash proceeds to the Company. As of September
30, 2024, all Adjuvant Purchase Rights remain outstanding. The conversion price of the Adjuvant Notes was as of September 30,
2024. Assuming this conversion price per share, the Adjuvant Notes could be converted into shares of common stock. 

The
Adjuvant Notes are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance for convertible debt instruments and are classified as current
liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The aggregate proceeds of million were initially classified as restricted
cash for financial reporting purposes due to contractual stipulations that specify the types of expenses the money can be spent on and
how it must be allocated. The conversion feature was required to be bifurcated as an embedded derivative because the Company did not
have a sufficient number of shares reserved upon conversion as of March 31, 2023; however, the fair value of such feature was immaterial
as of such date. As of June 30, 2023, the Company had a sufficient number of shares reserved and the conversion feature was reclassified
to stockholders deficit in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815) at that time. See Note 6 - Fair Value of Financial Instruments for a description of the accounting treatment for the Adjuvant Purchase Rights. 

The
Company was in default of the Adjuvant Notes as of September 30, 2023, due to the failure to meet the cumulative net sales requirement.
However, Adjuvant forbore such default in October 2023 and therefore the Company is no longer in default. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Adjuvant Notes are recorded in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as short-term convertible notes payable
with a total balance of million. The balance is comprised of million in principal, net of unamortized debt issuance costs,
and million in accrued interest. As of December 31, 2023, the Adjuvant Notes were recorded in the condensed consolidated balance
sheet as short-term convertible notes payable with a total balance of million. The balance was comprised of million in principal,
net of unamortized debt issuance costs, and million in accrued interest. 

Term
Notes 

December
2022 and February, March, April, July, August, and September 2023 Notes (SSNs) 

The
Company entered into eight Securities Purchase Agreements (SPAs) between December 2022 and September 2023 with certain investors.
Each of the agreements was materially similar. The variable details of each SPA, such as the principal amount of each note offering,
net proceeds, and maturity date, are outlined in the table below. Pursuant to each SPA, the Company agreed to sell in a registered
direct offering (i) unsecured 
senior subordinated notes with the maturity dates and aggregate issue prices (ii) warrants to purchase the listed number of shares
of the Company s common stock, par
value per share (including prefunded common stock Warrants as a part of the September 2023 SPA) and (iii) Series D Preferred Stock
(the Preferred Shares; December 2022 SPA only) (collectively, the Senior Subordinated Notes, or SSNs). The SSNs had net proceeds to
the Company, and are convertible at, the amounts listed below. Assuming the applicable conversion price per share, the SSNs
could be converted into shares of common stock as of September 30, 2024. 

The
SSNs interest rates are subject to increase to upon an event of default and the SSNs have no Company right to prepayment prior
to maturity; however, the Company has the option to redeem the respective SSNs at a redemption premium of . The Purchasers can also
require the Company to redeem their respective SSNs a) at the respective premium rate tied to the occurrence of certain subsequent transactions,
and b) in the event of subsequent placements (as defined). Also, pursuant to the terms of the SPAs, Purchasers have certain rights to
participate in subsequent issuances of the Company s securities, subject to certain exceptions. Additionally, the conversion rate
and warrant strike price are subject to adjustment upon the issuance of other securities (as defined) below the stated conversion rate
and strike price at issuance. The strike prices adjusted as discussed in the table below. 

The
Company evaluated the SSNs in accordance with ASC 480 and determined that the Notes were all liability instruments at issuance. The applicable
SSNs were then evaluated in accordance with the requirements of ASC 825 and the Company concluded that they were not precluded from electing
the fair value option for the applicable SSNs. 

The
Company also evaluated the Warrants in accordance with ASC 480 and determined that the Warrants issued before the Reverse Stock Split
in May 2023 were required to be recorded as liabilities at fair value in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets. The
applicable SSNs were marked-to-market at each reporting date with changes in fair value recognized in the condensed consolidated statement
of operations, unless the change is concluded to be related to changes in the Company s credit rating, in which case the change
was recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. As a result of the
Reverse Stock Split, the Company had sufficient shares available for issuance to cover the potential exercises; therefore, the Warrants
that were previously classified as liabilities were marked-to-market and reclassified to equity in May 2023. For the Warrants issued
after the Reverse Stock Split, the Company determined they were required to be recorded in equity. 

On
December 21, 2023, warrants to purchase up to shares of the Company s common stock were exchanged for shares of the
Company s series F-1 convertible and redeemable preferred stock (Series F-1 Shares, as defined below). The Series F-1 Shares, some
of which were also issued based on the partial value of certain purchase rights, as described above, were immediately exchanged for Aditxt
series A-1 preferred stock; and Series F-1 Shares were outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively,
and held by Aditxt. The Series F-1 Shares are to be cancelled, without the right to receive compensation, upon the consummation of the Merger.

Valuation
Methodology 

From
the third quarter of 2022 through the second quarter of 2023, the fair value of the Baker Notes issued, as described in Note
4 Debt , and subsequent changes in fair value recorded at each reporting date, was determined by estimating the fair value
of the Market Value of Invested Capital (MVIC) of the Company. This was estimated using forms of the cost and market approaches. In the
Cost approach, an adjusted net asset value method was used to determine the net recoverable value of the Company, including an estimate
of the fair of the Company s intellectual property. The estimated fair value of the Company s intellectual property was valued
using a relief from royalty method which required management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future
revenue, and the selection of the royalty and discount rates. The guideline public company method served as another valuation indicator.
In this form of the Market approach, comparable market revenue multiples were selected and applied to the Company s forward revenue
forecast to ultimately derive a MVIC indication. If the resulting fair value from these approaches was not estimated as greater than
the contractual payout, the fair value of the Baker Notes became only the Company MVIC available for distribution to this first lien
note holder. 

Starting
in the third quarter of 2023, the fair value of the Baker Notes is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation-based model. The Monte Carlo
simulation was used to take into account several embedded features and factors, including the exercise of the repurchase right, the Company s
future revenues, meeting certain debt covenants, the maturity term of the note and dissolution. For the dissolution scenario, the cost
approach, an adjusted net asset value method was used to determine the net recoverable value of the Company, including an estimate of
the fair value of the Company s intellectual property. The estimated fair value of the Company s intellectual property was
valued using a relief from royalty method which required management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts
of future revenue, and the selection of the royalty and discount rates. 

The
fair value of the Baker Notes is subject to uncertainty due to the assumptions that are used in the Monte Carlo simulation-based model.
These factors include but are not limited to the Company s future revenue, and the probability and timing of the exercise of the
repurchase right. The fair value of the Baker Notes is sensitive to these estimated inputs made by management that are used in the calculation. 

SSNs 

The
fair values of the SSNs issued, as described in Note 4 Debt , were determined using the methods
described above in Valuation Methodology using the residual value of the Company after the fair value of the Baker Notes. The
quarterly valuation adjustments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were respectively recorded as a million
and a 
million change in fair value of financial instruments attributed to credit risk change in the condensed consolidated comprehensive
statements of income (loss). The quarterly valuation adjustments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were
recorded as a 
million and a 
million change in fair value of financial instruments attributed to credit risk change in the condensed consolidated comprehensive
statements of income (loss). 

Purchase
Rights 

The
Adjuvant Purchase Rights and the May Note Purchase Rights (collectively Purchase Rights) are recorded as derivative liabilities in
the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Purchase Rights are valued using an OPM, like a Black-Scholes Methodology, with
changes in the fair value being recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The assumptions used
in the OPM are considered level 3 assumptions and include, but are not limited to, the market value of invested capital, the
cumulative equity value of the Company as a proxy for the exercise price and the expected term the Purchase Rights will be held
prior to exercise and a risk-free interest rate. 

Warrants 

Warrants
previously classified as liabilities were reclassified as equity instruments during the second quarter of 2023 as a result of the Reverse
Stock Split. The Company will continue to re-evaluate the classification of its warrants at the close of each reporting period to determine
their proper balance sheet classification. The warrants are valued using an OPM based on the applicable assumptions, which include the
exercise price of the warrants, time to expiration, expected volatility of our peer group, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends.
The assumptions used in the OPM are considered level 3 assumptions and include, but are not limited to, the market value of invested
capital, the cumulative equity value of the Company as a proxy for the exercise price, the expected term the warrants will be held prior
to exercise, a risk-free interest rate, and probability of change of control event. Additionally, because the warrants are re-priced
under certain provisions in the agreements, at each re-pricing event the Company must value the warrants using a Black-Scholes model
immediately prior to and immediately following the re-pricing event. The incremental fair value is recorded as an increase to accumulated
deficit and additional paid-in-capital, in accordance with ASC 470. 

SOLOSEC
Asset Acquisition Intangible Asset and Contingent Liabilities 

The
total consideration for the SOLOSEC asset acquisition included an up-front payment (paid at closing), sales-based payments to be
paid over the next 15 years (the Earnout Term) in each year in which SOLOSEC adjusted net revenue is over a specified threshold, a
 million
one-time payment once the cumulative SOLOSEC adjusted net revenues reach 
million, and assumption of quarterly royalty payments based on SOLOSEC net revenue. As discussed in Note 7 
Commitments and Contingencies , the fair value of the consideration is attributed to the SOLOSEC product line and was therefore
recorded as an intangible asset. 

The
fair value of the total consideration, including cash paid and future sales-based payments, is determined using a Monte Carlo
simulation model, which assumes the Company s revenue follows a geometric Brownian motion. Using specific revenue factors,
including expected growth, risk adjustments, and revenue volatility, future revenues were simulated through the Earnout Term to
assess whether sales-based payments would be triggered in each relevant period, as stipulated by the SOLOSEC Asset Purchase
Agreement. The average output of the Monte Carlo simulations for each period provides the expected payment value, which is then
discounted to its present value to derive the fair value of future sales-based payments and recorded as contingent
liabilities. The discount rate is based on (i) the risk-free rate, plus (ii) a credit spread reflecting the Company s
interest-bearing debt, (iii) an additional spread to account for credit migration as of the valuation date, and (iv) a further
incremental spread to reflect that the contingent liabilities is subordinated obligations relative to the Company s other
debt obligations. 

The
fair value of the SOLOSEC contingent liabilities is subject to uncertainty due to the assumptions made by management that are used
in the Monte Carlo simulation-based model. These factors include the estimated future SOLOSEC net revenue, the risk-neutral revenue
calculation and simulation assumptions, payment timing, and the discount rate. 

The fair value of the
SOLOSEC contingent liabilities will be updated at each reporting period using the methodology described above. Any changes to the
fair value will be recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of both the contingent liabilities and the SOLOSEC IP intangible
asset as per ASC 323, Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (ASC 323). Periodic intangible amortization will
also be updated based on the new fair value of the SOLOSEC IP. 

years. 

Per
the Transition Services Agreement (TSA) entered into in conjunction with the SOLOSEC asset acquisition, the Company is committed to
purchasing finished goods inventory from the seller through a transition period ending in November 2026 at a pre-defined unit price.
The total expected commitment is approximately million;
however, the quantities purchased can be negotiated if both parties agree. The Company concluded that the inventory purchase
commitment does not meet the definition of derivatives under ASC 815. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,
there were approximately million
in purchases under this commitment. The Company expects to purchase approximately million under this commitment
for the remainder of 2024, million in the year ended December 31, 2025, and million in the year ended December 2026. The TSA
also requires the seller to provide transitional support services until the Company can fully establish SOLOSEC operations; the Company
is obligated to pay an immaterial amount quarterly for these services. 

The Company is
also obligated to pay a quarterly royalty in amounts equal to a certain percentage of the SOLOSEC net revenue, beginning July 14,
2024. There are 
minimum quarterly or annual royalty payment amounts. Such royalty costs were immaterial for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, an immaterial amount related to the SOLOSEC royalty was included
in contingent liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. 

Operating
Leases 

Fleet
Lease 

In
December 2019, the Company and Enterprise FM Trust (the Lessor) entered into a Master Equity Lease Agreement whereby the Company leases
vehicles to be delivered by the Lessor from time to time with various monthly costs depending on whether the vehicles are delivered for
a term of 
 or 
 months, commencing on each corresponding delivery
date. The leased vehicles are for use by eligible employees of the Company s commercial operations team. As of September 30, 2024,
there were a total of leased
vehicles. The Company determined that the leased vehicles are accounted for as operating leases under ASC 842, Leases (ASC 842). 

In
September 2022, the Company extended the lease term of the vehicles with a term of months by an additional months. In May and
June 2024, the Company again extended the lease term by an additional months for vehicles with initial terms of months. In
both instances, the Company determined that such extensions are accounted for as modifications; the Company reassessed the lease
classification and the incremental borrowing rate on the modification dates and accounted for these modifications
accordingly. 

2020
Lease and the First Amendment 

On

In
November 2019, the Company entered into a supply and manufacturing agreement with a third-party to manufacture Phexxi, with
potential to manufacture other product candidates, in accordance with all applicable current good manufacturing practice
regulations. There were approximately million and million in purchases under the supply and manufacturing agreement
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and such purchases during the three and nine months ended September 30,
2023. 

Contingencies 

From
time to time the Company may be involved in various lawsuits, legal proceedings, or claims that arise in the ordinary course of
business. As of September 30, 2024, there were no other claims or actions pending against the Company which management believes have a probable, or a reasonably possible, probability of an unfavorable outcome other than the TherapeuticsMD dispute as described below. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company settled a portion of its trade payables with numerous
vendors, which resulted in a 
million reduction in trade payables. However, the Company may receive trade payable demand letters from its vendors that could
lead to potential litigation. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 
of our trade payables were greater than 90 days past due. 

On
December 14, 2020, a trademark dispute captioned TherapeuticsMD, Inc. v Evofem Biosciences, Inc., was filed in the U.S. District Court
for the Southern District of Florida against the Company, alleging trademark infringement of certain trademarks owned by TherapeuticsMD
under federal and state law (Case No. 9:20-cv-82296). On July 18, 2022, the Company settled the lawsuit with TherapeuticsMD, with certain
requirements which were required to be performed by July 2024 (the Settlement Timeline), including changing the name of Phexxi. The Company
failed to meet the terms of the settlement agreement by the Settlement Timeline. As a result, the Company is currently working with TherapeuticsMD
on resolution of this issue. In accordance with ASC 450, the Company has accrued 
 million, the present value of the probable settlement amounts payable over the next several years, as a component of contingent liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. 

As
of November 13, 2024, the Company has received five letters from purported Company stockholders demanding that the Company s
board of directors take action on behalf of the Company to remedy allegations regarding the Company s disclosures to shareholders
with respect to various alleged omissions of material information in its preliminary proxy statement filed September 23, 2024 relating
to the Amended and Restated Merger Agreement, as amended, and one demand made under Section 220 of the DGCL for books and records related
to the transaction and disclosures in the proxy statement. The Company believes all such demands are without merit. 

On
September 27, 2024, Future Pak, LLC, a Michigan limited liability company, as agent for the Purchasers (in such capacity, the Designated
Agent) provided a Notice of Event of Default and Reservation of Rights (the Notice of Default) relating to the Securities Purchase and
Security Agreement dated April 23, 2020, as amended (SPA), by and among the Company, Designated Agent, as certain guarantors and the
purchasers (each a Purchaser and collectively Purchasers). The Notice of Default claims that by entering into arrangements
to repay certain existing obligations, including obligations owed to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, an Event of Default
has occurred under Section 9.1(e) of the SPA. According to the Notice of Default, the Designated Agent has accelerated repayment of the
outstanding principal balance owed by the Company under the Securities Purchase Agreement. If all Purchasers exercise the Section 5.7
Option (as defined below), the repurchase price would be equal to approximately million. Pursuant to Section 5.7(b) of the SPA,
upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, each Purchaser may elect, at its option, to require the Company to repurchase the Note held
by such Purchaser (or any portion thereof) at a repurchase price equal to two times the sum of the outstanding principal balance and
all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, due within three business days after such Purchaser delivers a notice of such election (the
Section 5.7 Option). 

On October 27, 2024, the Designated Agent sent an amended and supplemented notice to the Notice of Default which adds additional claims
of default based on the Company s current repayment agreements of existing obligations, including obligations owed to the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, an Event of Default has occurred under Section 9.1(e) of the Securities Purchase and Security
Agreement dated April 23, 2020, as amended. Furthermore, the Amended Notice stated that, because the events of default described in the
Amended Notice of Default are not the certain prior events of default listed in the Forbearance Agreement (the Specified Defaults), the
Designated Agent and the holders of the senior secured promissory notes described in the SPA thereby provided notice to the Company that
the Forbearance Agreement is terminated as of October 27, 2024. The Company strongly disagrees with the Designated Agent s
claim that any Event of Default has occurred. The Company intends to vigorously contest any attempt by the Designated Agent and the Purchasers
to exercise their default rights and remedies under the SPA.

shares of common stock in a private placement at an exercise price of per share. The Second
Baker Amendment provides that the exercise price of the Baker Warrants will equal the conversion price of the Baker Notes. The exercise
price of the Baker warrants was per share as of September 30, 2024. 

In
May 2022, the Company completed an underwritten public offering (the May 2022 Public Offering) which included the issuance of common
warrants to purchase shares of common stock at a price to the public of and the issuance of common warrants to
purchase shares of common stock at a price to the public of (the May 2022 Common Stock Warrants). The May 2022 Common
Stock Warrants were exercisable beginning on May 24, 2022 and have a five-year term. Due to features in the May 2022 Common Stock
Warrants, including dilution adjustments requiring strike price resets, as of September 30, 2024 there were May 2022 Common
Stock Warrants outstanding with an exercise price of . 

In
June 2022, as required by the Second Baker Amendment, the Company issued the June 2022 Baker Warrants to purchase up to shares
of the Company s common stock, par value per share. The June 2022 Baker Warrants have an exercise price of per share
and a five-year term and were exercisable beginning June 28, 2022. The June 2022 Baker Warrants also contain customary and 
limitations on exercise provisions. The exercise price and number of shares issuable upon exercise of the June 2022 Baker Warrants is
subject to adjustment for certain dilutive issuances, stock splits and similar recapitalization transactions. The exercise price of these
warrants was per share as of September 30, 2024. 

In
February, March, April, July, August, and September 2023, pursuant to the SSNs as discussed in Note 4 Debt ,
the Company issued warrants to purchase up to shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of per
share, up to shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of per share, and up to shares
of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of per share. The exercise price of these warrants was per share
as of September 30, 2024. 

On
December 21, 2023, warrants to purchase up to shares of the Company s common stock were exchanged for shares of the
Company s Series F-1 Shares. 

As
of September 30, 2024, warrants to purchase up to shares of the Company s common stock remain outstanding at a weighted
average exercise price of per share. In accordance with ASC 815 , certain warrants previously classified as equity instruments
were determined to be liability classified (the Reclassified Warrants) due to the Company having an insufficient number of authorized
shares as of December 31, 2022; however, the impacted warrants were reclassified back to as equity instruments during the second quarter
of 2023 as a result of the May 2023 Reverse Stock Split. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company obtained waivers from a majority
of the convertible instrument holders, removing the requirement for shares to be reserved for conversion of their instruments, which
will prevent the instruments from needing to be liability classified due to an insufficient number of authorized shares going forward.
The Company will continue to re-evaluate the classification of its warrants at the close of each reporting period to determine the proper
balance sheet classification for them. These warrants are summarized below:

Convertible
and Redeemable Preferred Stock 

On
August 7, 2023, the Company filed a Certificate of Designation of Series E-1 Convertible Preferred Stock (E-1 Certificate of Designation),

into shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share and are both a) counted toward quorum on the basis of and b) have
voting rights equal to the number of shares of common stock into which the Series E-1 Shares are then convertible, subject to standard or beneficial ownership limitations. The Series E-1 Shares
are senior to all common stock with respect to preferences as to dividends, distributions, and payments upon a dissolution event. In the
event of a liquidation event, the Series E-1 Shares are entitled to receive an amount per share equal to the Black Scholes Value as of
the liquidation event plus the greater of 125 of the conversion amount (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) and the amount
the holder of the Series E-1 Shares would receive if the shares were converted into common stock immediately prior to the liquidation
event. If the funds available for liquidation are insufficient to pay the full amount due to the holders of the Series E-1 Shares, each
holder will receive a percentage payout. The Series E-1 Shares are entitled to dividends at a rate of 10 per annum or 12 upon a triggering
event. Dividends are payable in shares of common stock and may, at the Company s election, be capitalized and added to the principal
monthly. The Series E-1 Shares also have a provision that allows them to be converted to common stock at a conversion rate equal to the
Alternate Conversion Price (as defined in the E-1 Certificate of Designation) times the number of shares subject to conversion times
the redemption premium in the event of a Triggering Event (as defined in the E-1 Certificate of Designation) such as in a liquidation
event. The Series E-1 Shares are mandatorily redeemable in the event of bankruptcy. 

On

and accrued interest under the outstanding convertible promissory notes for shares of Series E-1 Shares (the August 2023 Preferred
Stock Transaction). Per the E-1 Certificate of Designation, the conversion rate can also be adjusted in several future circumstances,
such as on certain dates after the exchange date and upon the issuance of additional convertible securities with a lower conversion rate
or in the instance of a Triggering Event. As such, the conversion price as of June 30, 2024 was adjusted to per share and the
price has not been adjusted since. The Series E-1 Shares are classified as mezzanine equity within the condensed consolidated balance
sheets in accordance with ASC 480 because of a fixed 25 redemption premium upon a Triggering Event and no mandatory redemption feature.
During the year ended December 31, 2023, million was recorded as an increase to additional paid-in-capital for the preferred shares

into shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share and do not have the right to vote on any matters presented to
the holders of the Company s common stock. The Series F-1 Shares are senior to all common stock and subordinate to the Series E-1
Shares with respect to preferences as to distributions and payments upon a dissolution event. In the event of a liquidation event, the
Series F-1 Shares are entitled to receive an amount per share equal to the Black Scholes Value as of the liquidation event plus the greater
of 125 of the conversion amount (as defined in the F-1 Certificate of Designation) and the amount the holder of the Series F-1 Shares
would receive if the shares were converted into common stock immediately prior to the liquidation event. If the funds available for liquidation
are insufficient to pay the full amount due to the holders of the Series F-1 Shares, each holder will receive a percentage payout. The
Series F-1 Shares are not entitled to dividends. The Series F-1 Shares also have a provision that allows them to be converted to common
stock at a conversion rate equal to the Alternate Conversion Price (as defined in the F-1 Certificate of Designation) times the number
of shares subject to conversion times the 25 redemption premium in the event of a Triggering Event (as defined in the F-1 Certificate
of Designation) such as in a liquidation event. The Series F-1 Shares are mandatorily redeemable in the event of bankruptcy. In June
2024, the Required Holders, as defined in the F-1 Certificate of Designation, approved an amended and restated certificate of designation
(the Amended F-1 Certificate of Designation) to the Company s certificate of designation designating the rights, preferences and
limitations of the Company s Series F-1 Shares. The Amended F-1 Certificate of Designation provides for the removal of the conversion
price adjustment provisions previously included and changed the conversion price to . 

On
December 21, 2023, the Company issued a total of Series F-1 Shares to certain investors, including 613 shares exchanged for warrants
to purchase up to shares of the Company s common stock and shares to exchange a partial value of the outstanding
purchase rights. The holders of the Series F-1 Shares immediately exchanged their Series F-1 Shares into Aditxt s Series A-1 preferred
stock and, as a result, Aditxt currently holds all outstanding Series F-1 Shares. The Series F-1 Shares are to be cancelled upon
the consummation of the Merger. 

During
the third quarter of 2024, as part of the funding requirement by Aditxt pursuant to the A R Merger Agreement, the Company issued
a total of 
 Series F-1 Shares to Aditxt for an aggregate
purchase price of approximately 
 million. These shares were recorded at fair value with the variance between the immaterial fair value and the million cash received being recorded as additional paid-in-capital in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. As discussed in Note 10 - Subsequent events , subsequent to September 30, 2024, the
Company issued a total of

right shares for each Purchase Right was initially fixed at issuance, but subject to certain customary adjustments for certain dilutive
Company equity issuances until the second anniversary of issuance. These Purchase Rights expire on June 28, 2027. Refer to Note

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The
terms we, us, our, Evofem or the Company refer collectively to
Evofem Biosciences, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated. All information presented in this quarterly report
on Form 10-Q (Quarterly Report) is based on our fiscal year. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months
or periods refer to our fiscal years ending December 31 and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. 

You
should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our condensed consolidated
financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion
and analysis is set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business
and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including
those factors set forth in the Risk Factors section of this Quarterly Report, our actual results could differ materially
from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. 

Overview 

We
are a San Diego-based commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company with a strong focus on innovation in women s health. Our first
commercial product, Phexxi, was approved by the FDA on May 22, 2020. Phexxi is the first and only non-hormonal prescription contraceptive
gel. It is locally acting, with no systemic activity, and used on-demand by women only when they have sex. Because Phexxi is a non-hormonal
contraceptive, it is not associated with side effects of exogenous hormone use like depression, weight gain, headaches, loss of libido,
mood swings and irritability. Taking hormones may not be right for some women, especially those with certain medical conditions, including
clotting disorders hormone-sensitive cancer, diabetes or a BMI over 30, or those who are breast feeding or smoke. More than 23.3 million
women in the U.S. will not use a hormonal contraceptive. 

Evofem
has delivered Phexxi net sales growth in each consecutive year since it was launched in Sept 2020. Key growth drivers for 2024 include
expanded use of Phexxi in women who take oral birth control pills in conjunction with GLP-1 prescription medications like Ozempic, Mounjaro
and Zepbound for weight loss. These drugs may make oral birth control pills less effective at certain points in the dosing schedule.
Per the USPI, prescribers are instructed to advise patients using oral contraceptives to switch to a non-oral contraceptive method
or add a barrier method to prevent unintended pregnancy during these times. 

Outside
the U.S., Phexxi was approved in Nigeria on October 6, 2022, as Femidence by the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration
and Control. To-date, Phexxi has been submitted for approval in Mexico, Ethiopia and Ghana. We intend to commercialize Phexxi in all
other global markets through partnerships or licensing agreements. 

We halted clinical development
of our investigational product candidates in October 2022 to focus resources on growing sales of Phexxi for the prevention of pregnancy.

 Table of Contents 

On
July 17, 2024, we licensed exclusive commercial rights to Phexxi in the Middle East to Pharma 1 Drug Store, an emerging Emirati health
care company. The licensed territory includes the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and certain other countries
in the region. Pharma 1 is responsible for obtaining and maintaining any regulatory approvals required to market and sell Phexxi, and
will handle all aspects of distribution, sales and marketing, pharmacovigilance and all other commercial functions in these countries.
Evofem will supply Phexxi to Pharma 1 at cost-plus. Pharma 1 is expected to file for regulatory approval of Phexxi in the UAE in the
fourth quarter of 2024 and is contractually obligated to launch within 60 days of approval . 

In July 2024 we acquired global
rights to SOLOSEC. This FDA-approved single-dose oral antimicrobial agent provides a complete course of therapy for the treatment of two
common sexual health infections bacterial vaginosis (BV) and trichomoniasis. The SOLOSEC acquisition aligns with and advances
our mission to improve access to innovative and differentiated options that impact women s daily lives. We expect commercialization
of SOLOSEC will benefit from our commercial infrastructure and strong physician relationships. 

Recent
Developments 

On
October 30, 2024 Evofem paid its outstanding balance, including interest and penalties, to the FDA for its Fiscal Year 2023, 2024 and
2025 Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) invoices for Phexxi and the 2025 PDUFA invoice for SOLOSEC. 

Notice
of Default and Termination of Forbearance Agreement 

On
September 27, 2024, Future Pak, LLC, a Michigan limited liability company, as agent for the Purchasers (in such capacity, the Designated
Agent) provided a Notice of Event of Default and Reservation of Rights (the Notice of Default) relating to the Securities Purchase and
Security Agreement dated April 23, 2020, as amended (SPA), by and among the Company, Designated Agent, as certain guarantors and the
purchasers (each a Purchaser and collectively Purchasers). The Notice of Default claims that by entering into
arrangements to repay certain existing obligations, including obligations owed to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, an
Event of Default has occurred under Section 9.1(e) of the SPA. 

According
to the Notice of Default, the Designated Agent has accelerated repayment of the outstanding principal balance owed by the Company under
the Securities Purchase Agreement. If all Purchasers exercise the Section 5.7 Option (as defined below), the repurchase price would be
equal to approximately 106.8 million. Pursuant to Section 5.7(b) of the SPA, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, each Purchaser
may elect, at its option, to require the Company to repurchase the Note held by such Purchaser (or any portion thereof) at a repurchase
price equal to two times the sum of the outstanding principal balance and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, due within three business
days after such Purchaser delivers a notice of such election (the Section 5.7 Option). 

Subsequently,
on October 27, 2024, the Designated Agent sent an amended and supplemented notice to the Notice of Default which adds additional claims
of default based on the Company s current repayment agreements of existing obligations, including obligations owed to the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, an Event of Default has occurred under Section 9.1(e) of the Securities Purchase and Security
Agreement dated April 23, 2020, as amended. Furthermore, the Amended Notice stated that, because the events of default described in the
Amended Notice of Default are not the certain prior events of default listed in the Forbearance Agreement (the Specified Defaults), the
Designated Agent and the holders of the senior secured promissory notes described in the SPA thereby provided notice to the Company that
the Forbearance Agreement is terminated as of October 27, 2024. 

The
Company strongly disagrees with the Designated Agent s claim that any Event of Default has occurred. The Company intends to vigorously
contest any attempt by the Designated Agent and the Purchasers to exercise their default rights and remedies under the SPA.

the amount, or changes the form or timing (except with respect to extensions of time of the offer in accordance with the terms of the
A R Merger Agreement) of consideration payable to the Investors pursuant to the terms of the A R Merger Agreement as in effect
on the date hereof or (2) materially and adversely affects such Investor; or (e) is agreed to in writing by Aditxt and each Investor

equity requirements in Nasdaq listing rule 5550(b)(1). 

On September 23, 2024, the
Company filed a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC. Subject to certain exceptions, the
Company s Board of Directors will recommend that the A R Merger Agreement be adopted by the Company s stockholders
at a special meeting of the Company s stockholders (the Company Board Recommendation). However, subject to the satisfaction of
certain terms and conditions, the Company and the Board are permitted to take certain actions which may, as more
fully described in the A R Merger Agreement, include changing the Company Board Recommendation and entering into a definitive
agreement with respect to a Company Change of Recommendation (as defined in the A R Merger Agreement) if the Company Board or
any committee thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company s outside legal and financial advisors and
after taking into account relevant legal, financial, regulatory, estimated timing of consummation and other aspects of such proposal
that the Company Board considers in good faith and the Person or group making such proposal, would, if consummated in accordance
with its terms, result in a transaction more favorable to the Company Shareholders than the Merger. If the Company has a Company
Change of Recommendation, the Company must provide Aditxt with a ten (10) calendar day written notice thereof and negotiate with
Aditxt in good faith to provide a competing offer.

notes of Aditxt due on September 30, 2024 (the September 2024 Secured Notes), (iii) an aggregate principal amount of 5.0 million in
ten-year unsecured notes (the Unsecured Notes), and (iv) payment of 0.2 million in respect of net sales of Phexxi in respect of the
calendar quarter ended September 30, 2023. 

On
February 26, 2024, Aditxt and the Holders entered into an Assignment Agreement (the February Assignment Agreement), pursuant to which
the Company consented to the assignment of all remaining amounts due under the Notes from Aditxt back to the Holders. 

On
February 29, 2024, as part of the Third Amendment, Aditxt agreed to have, as a condition of closing, that the outstanding balance,
plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, in an amount not to exceed the Repurchase Price, shall have been paid in full. The
A R Merger Agreement, as amended, entered into on July 12, 2024, maintains the same condition to closing. As discussed above,
the A R Merger Agreement was amended on August 16, 2024, September 6, 2024, and October 2, 2024; none of the amendments updated
this closing condition.

Phexxi
as a Contraceptive; Commercial Strategies 

In
September 2020, we commercially launched Phexxi in the United States. Our sales force promotes Phexxi directly to obstetrician/gynecologists
and their affiliated health professionals, who collectively write the majority of prescriptions for contraceptive products. Our sales
force comprises approximately 16 regional sales representatives, two business directors and an SVP of Commercial Operations, supported
by a self-guided virtual health care provider (HCP) learning platform. Additionally, we offer women direct access to Phexxi via a telehealth
platform. Using this platform, women can directly meet with an HCP to determine their eligibility for a Phexxi prescription and, if eligible,
have the prescription written by the HCP, then filled and mailed directly to them by a third-party pharmacy. 

Our
comprehensive commercial strategy for Phexxi includes marketing and product awareness campaigns targeting women of reproductive potential
in the U.S., including the approximately 23.3 million women who are not using hormonal contraception and the approximately 20.0 million
women who are using a prescription contraceptive, some of whom, particularly oral birth control pill users, may be ready to move to an
FDA-approved, non-invasive, non-systemic hormone-free contraceptive, as well as certain identified target HCP segments. In addition to
marketing and product awareness campaigns, our commercial strategy includes payer outreach and execution of our consumer digital and
media strategy. 

Key
growth drivers for 2024 include expanded use of Phexxi in women who take oral birth control pills in conjunction with GLP-1 prescription
medications like Ozempic, Mounjaro and Zepbound for weight loss. These drugs may make oral birth control pills less effective at certain
points in the dosing schedule. Per the USPI, prescribers are instructed to advise patients using oral contraceptives to switch
to a non-oral contraceptive method or add a barrier method to prevent unintended pregnancy during these times. 

We
continue working to increase the number of lives covered and to gain a preferred formulary position for Phexxi. We gained approximately
17.7 million unrestricted lives (people whose plans cover Phexxi with no PA required) in the past two years, a 5 increase in unrestricted
coverage for Phexxi from January 2022 (47 to November 2023 (53 ). 

Payer
wins in 2024 include the removal of the Prior Authorization requirement for Phexxi by the Washington State Health Care Authority effective
January 1, 2024, and, as a result of the Company s successful renegotiation, a 7.4 reduction in the rebate paid by the Company
to Medi-Cal on Phexxi prescriptions dispensed to Medi-Cal members. The approval rate was over 80 for all of 2024 to-date. 

In
the second quarter of 2022, we successfully negotiated a contract with one of the largest pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) in the nation,
which added Phexxi to its formulary with no restrictions for most women covered by the plan. The agreement was retroactive and took effect
January 1, 2022 and is representative of approximately 46 million lives. 

An
additional 13.7 million lives are covered under our December 2020 contract award from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. 

We
also participate in government programs, including the 340B and the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. As a result of our participation in
the Medicaid National Drug Rebate Program, the U.S. Medicaid population gained access to Phexxi on January 1, 2021. As of May 2024, Medicaid
provides health coverage to approximately 73.9 million members; nearly two-thirds of adult women enrolled in Medicaid are in their reproductive
years (19-44). Additionally, we recently began participating in a 340B Group Purchasing Organization (GPO) that serves safety-net clinics
throughout the US. This GPO has over 6,500 members, which expands our reach among safety-net providers. 

Approximately
83 of commercial and Medicaid Phexxi prescriptions are being approved by payers.

 Table of Contents 

Phexxi
is classified in the databases and pricing compendia of Medi-Span and First Databank, two major drug information databases that payers
can consult for pricing and product information, as the first and only Vaginal pH Modulator. 

Effective
as of January 1, 2023, most insurers and PBMs must provide coverage, with no out-of-pocket costs (e.g. 0 copay) to the subscriber or
dependent, for FDA-approved contraceptive products, like Phexxi, prescribed by healthcare providers. 

As
a result, to comply with these Guidelines, payers are increasingly covering Phexxi by: 

Adding
 Phexxi to formulary (commercial insurers) or preferred drug list (Medicaid) 

Removing
 the requirement for a Prior Authorization letter from the HCP (commercial insurers) 

Moving
 Phexxi to 0 copay (commercial insurers) 

In
2022, Evofem developed and introduced a new contraceptive educational chart for patients and HCPs that details high-level information
about birth control methods currently available to women in the U.S., including the vaginal pH modulator. This new contraceptive educational
tool has been extremely well received and has had a positive impact with HCPs and patients alike. 

SOLOSEC 

In
July 2024, we expanded our commercial portfolio by acquiring global rights to SOLOSEC (secnidazole) 2g oral granules, a
single-dose oral antimicrobial agent that provides a complete course of therapy with just one dost for the treatment of two common
sexual health infections. SOLOSEC is FDA-approved for the treatment of two sexual health diseases: bacterial vaginosis (BV), a
common vaginal infection, in females 12 years of age and older, and Trichomonas vaginalis , a common sexually transmitted
infection (STI), in people 12 years of age and older. SOLOSEC has the same call point as Phexxi, enabling us to leverage our
commercial infrastructure and strong physician relationships. 

Bacterial
Vaginosis 

Bacterial
vaginosis (BV) affects an estimated 21 million women in the U.S., approximately 29 of the U.S. population, making it the most common
vaginal condition in women ages 15-44. It results from an overgrowth of bacteria, which upsets the balance of the natural vaginal microbiome
and can lead to symptoms including odor and discharge. Of interest, BV raises the pH of the vagina, making it a more friendly environment
for trichomoniasis and other STIs; approximately 20 of BV patients also have trichomoniasis. 

If
left untreated, BV can have serious health consequences. Untreated or improperly treated BV is associated with increased risk of infection
with STIs like HPV, herpes, trichomoniasis, chlamydia, gonorrhea and HIV, as well as transmission of STIs to a partner. Additional risks
include developing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which can threaten a women s fertility, and complications with gynecological
surgery. 

Research
has shown that as many as 50 of patients with BV do not adhere to a full course of metronidazole treatment (500mg BID x 7d) 14 doses.
58 of women who do not complete therapy will have a recurrence within one year. Noncompliance to a multiple-day metronidazole regimen
is a contributing factor to persistent BV. 

In
clinical trials, SOLOSEC demonstrated clinically and statistically significant efficacy in the treatment of BV with just one dose. The
clinical cure rate was 77 , and 68 of patients treated with SOLOSEC did not require any additional treatment for BV. Guidelines for
the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) in 2020 and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in 2021 each include
single dose SOLOSEC for the treatment of BV. 

Trichomoniasis 

Trichomoniasis
(Trich) is the most common non-viral STI in the world. It is caused by a parasite called Trichomonas
vaginalis and affects both women and men. All sexual partners of an infected person must be
treated to prevent reinfection with the parasite. In 2018, there were an estimated 6.9 million new T. vaginalis 
infections in the U.S. According to the CDC, the U.S. prevalence of T. vaginalis is 2.1 among females and 0.5 among males, with the highest rates among Black females (9.6 and Black males (3.6 ). A study of STD clinic
attendees in Birmingham, Alabama, identified a prevalence of 27 among women and 9.8 among men. Approximately 70 of women with trichomoniasis are also infected with the bacteria that cause BV. 

In
clinical trials, a single dose of SOLOSEC demonstrated a cure rate of 92.2 for Trich in women, while reported cure rates in males range
from 91.7 -100 . 

SOLOSEC s one-and-done dosing and the resulting high level of compliance is believed to be a significant differentiator.
Non-compliance to a multi-day metronidazole regimen is a contributing factor to persistent Trich or BV; and ACOG and the CDC no longer
recommend single dose metronidazole to treat Trich in women. 

Our
Pipeline 

While
Evofem s pipeline includes multiple candidates that are designed to address critical unmet needs in women s health, the Company
halted all clinical development in October 2022 due to financial constraints. 

EVO100
for STI Prevention 

EVO100
vaginal gel was in development for the prevention of urogenital chlamydia and gonorrhea in women. Chlamydia and gonorrhea are among the
many bacterial and viral pathogens that require a higher pH environment to thrive. The CDC reported that infections with these two sexually
transmitted pathogens cost the U.S. healthcare system 1.0 billion, in aggregate direct and indirect costs. There are no FDA-approved
drugs to prevent these sexually transmitted diseases (STIs). The FDA granted EVO100 Fast Track Designation for the prevention of chlamydia
and gonorrhea, and designated EVO100 a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) for the prevention of infection these pathogens. 

The
Phase 2B/3 trial (AMPREVENCE) achieved its primary and secondary endpoints, demonstrating statistically significant and clinically meaningful
reductions in chlamydia and gonorrhea infections of 50 and 78 , respectively, in women receiving EVO100 vs. placebo. Based on these
highly positive clinical outcomes we initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial (EVOGUARD) to evaluate EVO100 for these potential indications
in 2020. On October 11, 2022, we reported that EVOGUARD did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint. We and our advisors believe the public
health response to the COVID pandemic caused changes in clinical site operations and subject behavior and actions, including deviations
from following the clinical study protocol requirements related to STI acquisition, detection, and prevention, which contributed to this
outcome.

EVO200
Vaginal Gel for Recurrent Bacterial Vaginosis 

Our
investigational candidate for the reduction of recurrent bacterial vaginosis (BV), EVO200 vaginal gel, uses the same proprietary vaginal
pH modulator platform as Phexxi. In a Phase 1 dose-finding trial for this indication, the highest dose formulation of the study drug
demonstrated reduced vaginal pH for up to seven days following a single administration. The FDA has designed EVO200 as a Qualified Infectious
Disease Product (QIDP) for this indication, which provides several important potential advantages including, but not limited to, longer
market exclusivity. 

MPT
Vaginal Gel for HIV Prevention 

In
December 2021, we launched a collaboration with Orion Biotechnology Canada Ltd. (Orion) to evaluate the compatibility and stability of
Orion s novel CCR5 antagonist, OB-002, in Phexxi with the goal of developing a Multipurpose Prevention Technology (MPT) product
candidate for indications including the prevention of HIV in women. Assuming positive preclinical results, Evofem and Orion may seek
government and philanthropic funding for subsequent clinical trials of any resulting MPT vaginal gel product candidate. 

Thin
Film Project 

In
February 2020, we contracted with the University of South Australia to develop a vaginally applied thin film as a second-generation vaginal
pH modulator product. The lead thin film candidates have been selected, and stability data has been generated with positive results.
Next steps are to optimize the lead candidates and identify funding to proceed. 

Financial
Operations Overview 

Net
Product Sales 

We
recognize revenue once units shipped from our third-party logistics warehouse arrive at our customers, which consist of wholesale distributors,
retail pharmacies, telehealth companies, and mail-order specialty pharmacies. We have recognized net product sales in the U.S. since
the commercial launch of Phexxi in September 2020. Gross revenues, as discussed in Note
3 - Revenue , are adjusted for variable consideration, including our patient
support programs. 

Operating
Expenses 

Cost
of Goods Sold 

Inventory
costs include all purchased materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead. In addition, we are obligated to pay quarterly royalty
payments pursuant to our license agreement with Rush University, in amounts equal to a single-digit percentage of the gross amounts we
receive on a quarterly basis, less certain deductions incurred in the quarter based on a sliding scale. We are also obligated to pay
a minimum annual royalty amount of 0.1 million to the extent these earned royalties do not equal or exceed 0.1 million in a given year.
Such royalty costs, included in cost of goods sold, were 0.2 million and 0.6 million for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024, respectively, and 0.2 million and 0.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

We are
also obligated to pay quarterly royalty payments under the SOLOSEC Asset Purchase Agreement dated July 14, 2024 based on a
percentage of SOLOSEC net revenues. There are no minimum quarterly or annual royalty amounts. Such royalty costs were immaterial for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Research
and Development Expenses 

Our
research and development expenses primarily consist of costs associated with the continuous improvements related to Phexxi. These expenses
include: 

improvements
 of manufacturing and analytical efficiency; 

on-going
 product characterization and process optimization; 

alternative
 raw material evaluation to secure an uninterrupted supply chain and reduce cost of goods sold; 

employee-related
 expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and noncash stock-based compensation expense; and 

facilities,
 depreciation and other allocated expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, depreciation
 of leasehold improvements and equipment, and research and other supplies. 

We
expense internal and third-party research and development expenses as incurred. The following table summarizes research and development

Selling
and Marketing Expenses 

Our
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of product commercialization costs, the Phexxi telehealth platform, training, salaries, benefits, travel, noncash stock-based compensation expense and other related
costs for our employees and consultants. 

In
connection with our overall cost reduction strategy, our selling and marketing expenses decreased significantly in 2023 and are
expected to stabilize slightly below 2023 levels in the current year, with a slight increase due to the expenses associated with the addition of
SOLOSEC to our commercial offering. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

Our
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, travel, business development expenses, investor and public
relations expenses, noncash stock-based compensation, and other related costs for our employees and consultants performing executive,
administrative, finance, legal and human resource functions. Other general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs
not otherwise included in research and development or selling and marketing, and professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and
legal fees, and other costs associated with obtaining and maintaining our patent portfolio. 

Other
Income (Expense) 

Other
income (expense) consists primarily of interest expense and the change in fair value of financial instruments issued in various
capital raise transactions. The change in fair value of financial instruments was recognized as a result of mark-to-market
adjustments for those financial instruments. Additionally, other income (expense) also includes a gain (loss) on debt modification
or extinguishment in the current period and loss on issuance of financial instruments in each of the presented periods.

The decrease in product sales, net, was primarily due to the impact of the timing of price increases on sales volumes to our
customers. Wholesalers typically purchase larger volumes of product ahead of a price increase, pause purchasing until that product
has been used to fill consumer demand, then resume purchasing again. Sales volume in the first quarter of 2024 was low due to the
January 2024 price increase, where sales volume in the first quarter of 2023 was high, after a very small fourth quarter of 2022 due
to the October 2022 price increase.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Overview 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had a working capital deficit of 67.7 million and an accumulated deficit of 894.6 million. We have financed
our operations to date primarily through the issuance of preferred stock, common stock, warrants and convertible and term notes; cash
received from private placement transactions; and, to a lesser extent, product sales. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately
 0.7 million in cash and cash equivalents comprised entirely of restricted cash available for use as prescribed in the Adjuvant Notes
(as defined in Note 4 - Debt ). Our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash include amounts held in checking accounts.
Management believes that the Company s cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 are insufficient to fund operations for
at least the next 12 months from the date on which this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is filed with the SEC. 

We
have incurred losses and negative cash flows from operating activities since inception. In 2023, we focused on further improving and
increasing Phexxi access and delivered our third consecutive year of Phexxi net sales growth. We have restructured many of our trade
payables with extended terms and implemented measures to better align our cost structure with projected revenues. In 2024, we have continued
to focus on top-line growth while maintaining a lean operating structure. We will continue to explore opportunities for organic growth,
entry into new markets, and expansion of our product offering beyond Phexxi and SOLOSEC. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company s significant commitments include the Baker Notes and Adjuvant Notes, as described in Note
4 - Debt and fleet leases, Rush University royalty, and SOLOSEC royalty, as described in Note 7 - Commitments
and Contingencies . Management s plans to meet the Company s cash flow needs in the next 12 months include generating
revenue from the sale of Phexxi and SOLOSEC, further restructuring of its current payables, and obtaining additional funding through
means such as the issuance of its capital stock, non-dilutive financings, or through collaborations or partnerships with other
companies, including license agreements for Phexxi and/or SOLOSEC in the U.S. or foreign markets, or other potential business
combinations (including the Merger, as defined in Note 1 Description of Business and Basis of
Presentation ). 

If
the Company is not able to obtain the required funding through a significant increase in revenue, equity or debt financings, license
agreements for Phexxi in the U.S. or foreign markets, or other means, is enjoined from selling under the Phexxi mark, or is unable
to obtain funding on terms favorable to the Company, there will be a material adverse effect on commercialization and development
operations and the Company s ability to execute its strategic development plan for future growth. If the Company cannot
successfully raise additional funding and implement its strategic development plan, the Company may be forced to make further
reductions in spending, including spending in connection with its commercialization activities, extend payment terms with suppliers,
liquidate assets where possible at a potentially lower amount than as recorded in the condensed consolidated financial statements,
suspend or curtail planned operations, or cease operations entirely. Any of these could materially and adversely affect the
Company s liquidity, financial condition and business prospects, and the Company would not be able to continue as a going
concern. The Company has concluded that these circumstances and the uncertainties associated with the Company s ability to
obtain additional equity or debt financing on terms that are favorable to the Company, or at all, and otherwise succeed in its
future operations raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

44 

 Table of Contents 

If
we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and, in doing so, we may receive less than the value
at which those assets are carried on our condensed consolidated financial statements. Any of these developments would materially and
adversely affect the price of our stock and the value of an investment in our stock. As a result, our condensed consolidated financial
statements include explanatory disclosures expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

The
opinion of our independent registered public accounting firms on our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the
years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 contains an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern. Future reports on our consolidated financial statements may include an explanatory paragraph with respect to our
ability to continue as a going concern. Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024 and for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included in this Quarterly Report do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts of liabilities that might be necessary should
we be unable to continue our operations. 

Debt
Financings 

As
described in Note 4 - Debt , we entered into an insurance premium financing agreement with FIF, which resulted in
a financing inflow of 0.4 million in the statement of cash flows in the first three quarters of 2024. Additionally, we received gross
proceeds of approximately 5.3 million, before issuance costs, from the sale of notes and warrants in seven registered direct offerings
in the first three quarters of 2023.

Cash
Flows from Operating Activities . During the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, the primary use of cash, cash equivalents and restricted
cash was to fund the commercialization and manufacturing of Phexxi and to support general and administrative operations. 

Cash
Flows from Investing Activities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the primary use of cash,
cash equivalents and restricted cash was the acquisition of the SOLOSEC asset. 

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the primary source of cash, cash equivalents,
and restricted cash was from the 1.0 million received from Aditxt in order to reinstate the Merger Agreement as described above as
well as the 1.3 million in Series F-1 Preferred Stock purchased by Aditxt, and the finance agreement with First Insurance Funding
for 0.4 million. These inflows were offset by 0.4 million payments under the Baker Notes and short-term debt. During the nine months ended September
30, 2023, the primary source of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was the sale of senior subordinate convertible notes and
warrants for proceeds of approximately 5.3 million, in aggregate, before debt issuance costs, which was offset by the 1.0 million
upfront payment required under the Baker Fourth Amendment. 

Operating
and Capital Expenditure Requirements 

Our
specific future operating and capital expense requirements are difficult to forecast. However, we can anticipate the general types of
expenses and areas in which they might occur. In 2024, while we expect to maintain a lean operating structure at approximately the same
level as 2023, should resources become available we may increase marketing spend to drive further sales growth.

Contractual
Obligations and Commitments 

Operating
Leases 

Operating
lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities were 0.1 million each on both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. See Note
7- Commitments and Contingencies for more detailed discussions on leases and financial statements information under ASC 842, Leases.

Other
Contractual Commitments 

As
described in Note 7 - Commitments and Contingencies , in November 2019, the Company entered into a supply and
manufacturing agreement with a third-party to manufacture Phexxi, with potential to manufacture other product candidates, in
accordance with all applicable current good manufacturing practice regulations. There were approximately 0.8 million and 1.0
million in purchases under the supply and manufacturing agreement for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and no such
purchases during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

As described in Note 7 - Commitments and Contingencies , the Company also has commitments related to the SOLOSEC asset acquisition including a commitment to purchase inventory
from the seller through November 2026 at a pre-defined unit price. The Company is also obligated to pay contingent liabilities and quarterly
royalties based on SOLOSEC net revenue over the Earnout Term as described in Note 7 - Commitments and Contingencies . 

Intellectual
Property Rights 

As
described in Note 7 - Commitments and Contingencies , royalty costs owed to Rush University pursuant to the Rush
License Agreement were 0.2 million and 0.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 0.2
million and 0.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023, approximately 1.7 million and 1.1 million were included in accrued expenses in the condensed consolidated balance sheets
and will be paid via the agreed upon payment plan.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures
include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including
its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

46 

 Table of Contents 

As
described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control
over financial reporting. As a result of these material weaknesses, our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO)
have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required
to be disclosed in the reports we file and submit under the Securities and Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
as and when required. 

Notwithstanding
the conclusion by our CEO and CFO that our Disclosure Controls as of September 30, 2024 were not effective, and notwithstanding the material
weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described more fully under Item 9A in the Company s Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, management believes that the condensed consolidated financial statements and related
financial information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present in all material respects our financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows as of the date presented, and for the periods ended on such dates, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). 

Remediation
Activities: 

Management
continues to evaluate the material weaknesses discussed above and is implementing its remediation plan. However, assurance as to when
the remediation efforts will be complete cannot be provided and the material weaknesses cannot be considered remedied until the applicable
controls have operated for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating
effectively. Management cannot assure readers that the measures that have been taken to date, and are continuing to be implemented, will
be sufficient to remediate the material weaknesses identified or to avoid potential future material weaknesses. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Except
for ongoing remediation activities, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our latest
fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Inherent
Limitations of Internal Controls 

Management
recognizes that a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that
the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,
and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems,
no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud or error, if any, have been detected.
These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because
of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two
or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions
about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under
all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance
with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due
to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including the risks described below. See
the section titled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. The risk factors set forth below with an asterisk ) next to the title contain changes to the description of the risk factors associated with our business previously disclosed in Item
1A of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

The
Company received two Notice of Defaults (on September 27, 2024 and October 27, 2024) from their largest creditor, Future Pak, LLC , alleging
a number of Events of Default, accelerating the Principal due and payable and declaring the termination of the existing Forbearance Agreement.

On
September 27, 2024, Future Pak, LLC, a Michigan limited liability company, as agent for the Purchasers (in such capacity, the Designated
Agent) provided a Notice of Event of Default and Reservation of Rights (the Notice of Default) relating to the Securities Purchase and
Security Agreement dated April 23, 2020, as amended (SPA), by and among the Company, Designated Agent, as certain guarantors and the
purchasers (each a Purchaser and collectively Purchasers). The Notice of Default claims that by entering into arrangements
to repay certain existing obligations, including obligations owed to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, an Event of Default
has occurred under Section 9.1(e) of the SPA. 

According
to the Notice of Default, the Designated Agent has accelerated repayment of the outstanding principal balance owed by the Company under
the Securities Purchase Agreement. If all Purchasers exercise the Section 5.7 Option (as defined below), the repurchase price would be
equal to approximately 106.8 million. Pursuant to Section 5.7(b) of the SPA, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, each Purchaser
may elect, at its option, to require the Company to repurchase the Note held by such Purchaser (or any portion thereof) at a repurchase
price equal to two times the sum of the outstanding principal balance and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, due within three business
days after such Purchaser delivers a notice of such election (the Section 5.7 Option). 

On October 27, 2024, the Designated Agent sent an amended and supplemented notice to the Notice of Default which adds additional claims
of default based on the Company s current repayment agreements of existing obligations, including obligations owed to the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, an Event of Default has occurred under Section 9.1(e) of the Securities Purchase and Security
Agreement dated April 23, 2020, as amended. Furthermore, the Amended Notice stated that, because the events of default described in the
Amended Notice of Default are not the certain prior events of default listed in the Forbearance Agreement (the Specified Defaults), the
Designated Agent and the holders of the senior secured promissory notes described in the SPA thereby provided notice to the Company that
the Forbearance Agreement is terminated as of October 27, 2024. 

Subsequently, on November 8, 2024, the Designated Agent sent an amended and supplemented notice to the Notices (the
Third Amended Notice of Default) which adds new claims of default based on (i) the Company s failure to maintain a cash position
of 1.0 million or greater, as required under Section 5(b) of the Forbearance Agreement (ii) the Company s failure to deliver financial
and operating reports in accordance with the timeline required under the Section 8.1(n) of the Baker Stock Purchase Agreement, and (iii)
to clarify the outstanding balance under the notes of the Baker Stock Purchase Agreement plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon,
in the sum of approximately is 107.0 million as opposed to the Repurchase Price as defined in the Fourth Amendment. 

As
such, the Designated Agent could take significant, adverse action against the Company, its assets and its accounts. There can be no assurances
that the Company can cure the Events of Default or otherwise stop or mitigate any adverse actions taken by the Designated Agent. 

TherapeuticsMD
may take adverse action against the Company and its use of the Phexxi mark. 

On
December 14, 2020, a trademark dispute captioned TherapeuticsMD, Inc. v Evofem Biosciences, Inc., was filed in the U.S. District Court
for the Southern District of Florida against the Company, alleging trademark infringement of certain trademarks owned by TherapeuticsMD
under federal and state law (Case No. 9:20-cv-82296). On July 18, 2022, the Company settled the lawsuit with TherapeuticsMD, with certain
requirements which were required to be performed by July 2024 (the Settlement Timeline), including changing the name of Phexxi. On July
29, 2024 the Company received a cease and desist letter from TherapeuticsMD, demanding that the Company change the name of Phexxi. The
Company is currently finalizing plans to re-brand Phexxi in connection with the settlement reached
with TherapeuticsMD in 2022.

There
can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the continued listing standards of OTCQB. 

OTC
has certain listing standards that we must meet to maintain our listing on the OTCQB exchange. If we are unable to comply with these continued listing standards, we and our stockholders could face significant material adverse consequences including: 

a
 limited availability of market quotations for our securities; 

reduced
 liquidity for our securities; 

a
 limited amount of new and analyst coverage; and 

a
 decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. 

As of November 7, 2024, the Company regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement of OTCQB, however there can be no guarantee the Company will remain in
compliance with such listing requirements in the future. 

Our
stock price is and may continue to be volatile. 

Our
Common Stock is currently quoted for public trading on the OTCQB under the symbol EVFM . The market price for our common
stock is volatile and may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, many of which we cannot control, such as potential
irregularity in financial results from quarter to quarter, political developments related to women s reproductive rights and contraception,
the content and tone of media coverage and commentary, or changes in securities analysts recommendations, any of which could cause
the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. Each of these factors, among others, could harm your investment in our securities
and could result in your being unable to resell any of our securities that you purchase at a price equal to or above the price you paid. 

In
addition, the stock market in general and the market for biopharmaceutical companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility
that has often been unrelated to companies operating performance. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors,
including: 

the
 potential delisting of our common stock from OTCQB, should we not comply with listing standards; 

failure
 to timely file future required filings; 

the
 failure to consummate the transactions in the A R Merger Agreement; 

the
 loss of key personnel; 

the
 results of our efforts to commercialize Phexxi, SOLOSEC, or any other products, particularly in the event of a rebrand; 

the
 results of our efforts to acquire or in-license products; 

commencement
 or termination of any collaboration or licensing arrangement; 

disputes
 or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection
 for our technology; 

announcements
 by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures and capital commitments; 

additions
 or departures of key management personnel; 

variations
 in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us; 

new
 products, product candidates or new uses for existing products introduced or announced by our competitors, and the timing of these
 introductions or announcements; 

results
 of clinical trials of product candidates of our competitors; 

general
 economic and market conditions and other factors that may be unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance
 of our competitors, including changes in market valuations of similar companies, wars, terrorism and political unrest, outbreak of
 disease (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic), boycotts and other business restrictions; 

regulatory
 or legal developments in the US and other countries; 

changes
 in the structure of healthcare payment systems; 

conditions
 or trends in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries; 

actual
 or anticipated changes in earnings estimates, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts; 

announcement
 or expectation of additional financing efforts and related debt and equity issuances; 

sales
 of common stock by us or our stockholders in the future, as well as the overall trading volume of our common stock; 

stockholder
 activism; 

any
 stockholder derivative actions; and 

other
 factors described in this Risk Factors section.

Upon
being listed on the OTCQB Marketplace on October 10, 2022 the closing sales price started at 21.25, was 0.064 as of December 31, 2023,
was 0.0158 as of March 21, 2024 and was 0.0090 as of September 30, 2024. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading
price or liquidity of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in companies stock prices, securities class-action
litigation has often been instituted against such companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs
and diversion of management s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition. 

We
will need to raise significant additional funds to finance our operations, including the commercialization of Phexxi and SOLOSEC, and
to remain a going concern. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed or on acceptable terms, we may be forced to delay,
reduce and/or eliminate one or more of our business initiatives or to cease our operations entirely. 

We
have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows since our inception. We believe our existing capital resources as of the
filing of this Quarterly Report are sufficient to fund our planned operations into the first half of 2025. Our ability to raise
additional funds will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully commercialize Phexxi and SOLOSEC (collectively our Products)
in the US. If, for whatever reason, we are unsuccessful in these efforts, it may make any necessary debt, equity or alternative
financing more difficult, more costly and more dilutive. Attempting to secure additional financing will divert our management from
our day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to commercialize our Products. In addition, we cannot guarantee
that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Furthermore, the global
credit and financial markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruptions in recent history, particularly for life science
companies. If the equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult, more
costly and more dilutive. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed or on acceptable terms, we may be unable to
continue commercializing Phexxi as a contraceptive or successfully relaunch SOLOSEC as a treatment for bacterial vaginosis or trichomoniasis. In addition, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our business initiatives or be
forced to cease operations entirely. To the extent we raise additional capital through the sale of equity, convertible debt or other
securities convertible into equity, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these new
securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Future debt
financings, if available at all, would likely involve agreements with additional covenants limiting or restricting our ability to
take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, making additional product acquisitions, or
declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through strategic collaborations (including, but not limited to closing the Merger
Agreement with Aditxt), alternative non-dilutive financing, such as royalty-based financing, or licensing arrangements with third
parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to Phexxi, SOLOSEC, or future revenue streams or grant licenses on terms that are
not favorable to us. 

Women s
health has historically been an underfunded sector. Recently, a number of public companies focused in women s health have failed
to achieve expected commercial success and struggled to access sufficient capital. We are solely focused in women s health and
may be unfavorably impacted by weak investor sentiment and a lack of interest in the category. Our ability to access capital and to advance
our candidates could be adversely impacted. 

We
are solely focused in women s health, and primarily in the areas of contraception, vaginal health, reproductive health, and sexual
health. The sector has historically been underfunded, with only about one percent of healthcare research and innovation in the U.S. invested
in female-specific conditions beyond oncology according to market research. The failure of the women s health sector to receive
consistent and committed investment fuels investor sentiment that market opportunities for new products in women s health are limited.
Our stock price and our ability to access additional capital on acceptable terms when needed may be adversely impacted by unfavorable
investor perception of market opportunities for women s health products, and our business, operating results, financial condition
and prospects could suffer.

 Table of Contents 

We
face competition from other medical device, biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies and our operating results will suffer if we
are unable to compete effectively. 

The
medical device, biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries, and the women s health sector, are intensely competitive. Significant
competition among various contraceptive products already exists. Existing products have name recognition, are marketed by companies with
established commercial infrastructures, and are marketed with greater financial, technical and personnel resources than we have. To compete
and gain market share, any new product must demonstrate advantages in efficacy, convenience, tolerability, and/or safety, among other
things. In addition, new products developed by others could emerge as competitors to Phexxi. These products could potentially offer an
alternative form of non-hormonal contraception that is more convenient, is more effective and/or provides protection over longer periods
of time as compared to Phexxi. We also compete with these organizations to recruit management, and sales and marketing personnel. Any
failure to attract and retain such personnel could negatively affect our level of expertise and our ability to execute our business plan.
We also face competition in connection with identifying and engaging in strategic transactions. If we are not able to compete effectively
against our current and future competitors, our business will not grow and our financial condition and operations will suffer. 

With
respect to SOLOSEC, there are many FDA-approved products for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis, and many are generic. SOLOSEC will
compete with those products. Current therapies for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis primarily consist of oral and vaginal formulations
of antibiotics delivered as a single dose or through multiple doses over consecutive days. If health care providers do not view the prescribing
information for SOLOSEC as compelling compared with other products available for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis, or if competitive
products have better insurance coverage or reimbursement levels than SOLOSEC, health care providers may opt to continue to prescribe
existing treatments rather than recommend or prescribe SOLOSEC to their patients. 

Our
potential competitors include large, well-established pharmaceutical companies and specialty pharmaceutical companies who have significantly
more resources than Evofem. These companies include Merck Co., Inc., Organon, Allergan PLC, Pfizer Inc., Bayer AG, Johnson 
Johnson, CooperSurgical Inc. and Mylan Inc. Additionally, several generic manufacturers currently market and continue to introduce new
generic contraceptives. 

Phexxi,
SOLOSEC, and any other approved products we promote may not gain sufficient market acceptance among physicians, patients or the medical
community, thereby limiting our potential to generate revenue, which will undermine our future growth prospects. 

Even
though Phexxi has been approved by the FDA for commercial sale for the prevention of pregnancy, and SOLOSEC has been approved by the
FDA for commercial sale for the prevention of BV and trichomoniasis, the degree of market acceptance of any new product by physicians,
patients and the medical community will depend on a number of factors, including: 

demonstrated
 evidence of efficacy and safety and potential advantages compared to competing products; 

perceptions
 by the medical community, physicians, and patients, regarding the safety and effectiveness of the product and the willingness of
 the target patient population to try it and of physicians to prescribe it; 

relative
 convenience and ease of administration compared to other products approved for the same indication; 

the
 regulatory label requirements for the product, including any potential restrictions on use or precautionary statements; 

sufficient
 third-party insurance coverage and adequate reimbursement; 

the
 terms of any approvals, such as any restrictions on the use of our product together with other medications; 

the
 willingness of wholesalers and pharmacies to stock the products; 

the
 prevalence and severity of any adverse side effects; 

the
 ability to sufficiently educate physicians with respect to the product s safety and efficacy; and 

availability
 of alternative products and the cost-effectiveness of our product relative to competing products. 

If
any approved product that we may license, acquire or sell, including Phexxi, does not provide a benefit over currently available options,
that product is unlikely to achieve market acceptance, and we will not generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability.

EMPLOYMENT
AGREEMENT 

This
Employment Agreement (this Agreement is made and entered into this 8th day of November, 2024 (the Effective Date by and between Evofem Biosciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation Company ), and Ivy Zhang Employee ). 

1. Roles
and Duties . 

(a) Chief
Financial Officer Role . Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Company shall employ Employee as its Chief Financial
Officer reporting to the Company s Chief Executive Officer CEO ). The Employee shall have such duties and responsibilities
as are reasonably determined by the CEO and are consistent with the duties customarily performed by a Chief Financial Officer of a similarly
situated company in the United States. Employee accepts such employment upon the terms and conditions set forth herein and agrees to
perform such duties and discharge such responsibilities to the best of Employee s ability. During Employee s employment,
Employee shall devote all of Employee s business time and energies to the business and affairs of the Company. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing herein shall preclude Employee from (i) performing services for such other companies as the Company may designate
or permit; (ii) serving, with the prior written consent of the Company s Board of Directors Board ), which consent

entity) of non-competing businesses or charitable, educational or civic organizations; (iii) engaging in charitable activities and community
affairs; and (iv) managing Employee s personal investments and affairs; provided, however, that the activities set out in clauses
(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) shall be limited by Employee so as not to materially interfere, individually or in the aggregate, with the
performance of Employee s duties and responsibilities hereunder. 

2. Term
of Employment.

occur of the following and in accordance with the following: 

(i) Death.
Immediately upon Employee s death; 

(ii) Termination
by the Company. 

(A) If
because of Employee s Disability (as defined below in Section 2(c)), written notice by the Company to Employee that Employee s
employment is being terminated as a result of Employee s Disability, which termination shall be effective on the date of such notice
or such later date as specified in writing by the Company; 

- 1 - 

(B) If
for Cause (as defined below in Section 2(d)), written notice by the Company to Employee that Employee s employment is being terminated
for Cause, which termination shall be effective on the date of such notice or such later date as specified in writing by the Company;
provided that if prior to the effective date of such termination Employee has cured the circumstances giving rise to the Cause (if capable
of being cured as provided in Section 2(d)), then such termination shall not be effective; or 

(C) If
by the Company for reasons other than under Sections 2(b)(ii)(A) or (B), written notice by the Company to Employee that Employee s
employment is being terminated, which termination shall be effective thirty (30) days after the date of such notice. 

(iii) Termination
by Employee . 

(A) If
for Good Reason (as defined below in Section 2(e)), written notice by Employee to the Company that Employee is terminating Employee s
employment for Good Reason and that sets forth the factual basis supporting the alleged Good Reason, which termination shall be effective
thirty (30) days after the date of such notice; provided that if prior to the effective date of such termination the Company has cured
the circumstances giving rise to the Good Reason if capable of being cured as provided in Section 2(e), then such termination shall not
be effective; or 

(B) If
without Good Reason, written notice by Employee to the Company that Employee is terminating Employee s employment, which termination
shall be effective no fewer than thirty (30) days after the date of such notice unless such notice period is waived, in whole or in part,
by the Company. 

Notwithstanding
anything in this Section 2(b), the Company may at any point, under the conditions set forth in Section 2(b)(ii)(B), terminate Employee s
employment for Cause prior to the effective date of any other termination contemplated hereunder; provided that if prior to the effective
date of such for-Cause termination Employee has cured the circumstances giving rise to the Cause (if capable of being cured as provided
in Section 2(d)), then such termination shall not be effective. 

(c) Definition
of Disability . For purposes of this Agreement, Disability shall mean Employee s incapacity or inability
to perform Employee s duties and responsibilities as contemplated herein by reason of a medically determinable mental or physical
impairment for one hundred twenty (120) days or more within any one (1) year period (cumulative or consecutive), which impairment can
reasonably be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than six (6) months. 

The
determination that Employee is disabled hereunder, if disputed by the parties, shall be resolved by a physician reasonably satisfactory
to Employee and the Company, at the Company s expense, and the determination of such physician shall be final and binding upon
both Employee and the Company. Employee hereby consents to such examination and consultation by a physician. The Company will keep all
information it receives as a result of such inquiry and determination confidential and will not use it for any purpose other than in
connection with exercising its rights under this Agreement. 

- 2 - 

(d) Definition
of Cause. As used herein, Cause shall mean: (i) Employee s conviction of (A) a felony or (B) any
misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, deceit, dishonesty or fraud; (ii) Employee s willful failure or refusal to comply with lawful
directions of Employee s supervisor or the Board, which failure or refusal continues for more than five (5) business days after
written notice is given to Employee, which notice sets forth in reasonable detail the nature of such failure or refusal; (iii) willful
and material breach by Employee of a material written Company policy or this Agreement, provided Employee does not cure such breach within
five (5) business days after receiving written notice of the alleged breach; or (iv) misconduct by Employee that materially damages the
Company or any of its affiliates. Except in the case of (ii) above, it is not necessary that the Company s finding of Cause occur
prior to Employee s termination of service. If the Company determines, subsequent to Employee s termination of service, that
prior to Employee s termination, Employee engaged in conduct which would constitute Cause (other than pursuant to
(ii) above), then Employee shall have no right to any benefit or compensation under this Agreement. 

(e) Definition
of Good Reason. As used herein, Good Reason shall mean: (i) relocation of Employee s principal
business location to a location more than fifty (50) miles from Employee s then-current business location; (ii) a material diminution
in Employee s duties, authority or responsibilities, which shall include, without limitation, Employee no longer performing similar
functions associated with Employee s services as Chief Financial Officer of a Company registered under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended; (iii) a reduction in Employee s then in effect Base Salary by more than 10 and in a manner inconsistent
with other employees of the Company having similar authority; or (iv) willful and material breach by the Company of its covenants and/or
obligations under this Agreement; provided that, in each of the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv) (A) Employee provides Company with
written notice that Employee intends to terminate Employee s employment hereunder for one of the grounds set forth in this Section
2(e) within thirty (30) days of such ground occurring, (B) if such ground is capable of being cured, Company has failed to cure such
ground within a period of thirty (30) days from the date of such written notice, and (C) Employee terminates by written notice Employee s
employment within sixty-five (65) days from the date that Employee provides the notice contemplated by clause (A) of this Section 2(e).
For purposes of clarification, the above-listed conditions shall apply separately to each occurrence of Good Reason, and failure to adhere
to such conditions in the event of Good Reason shall not disqualify Employee from asserting Good Reason for any subsequent occurrence
of Good Reason. For purposes of this Agreement, Good Reason shall be interpreted in a manner, and limited to the extent
necessary, so that it shall not cause adverse tax consequences for either party with respect to Section 409A Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code and any successor statute, regulation and guidance thereto.

such installment all amounts required to be deducted or withheld under applicable law or under any employee benefit plan in which Employee

such target amount. The amount of the Annual Performance Bonus earned shall be determined and approved by the Board or an appropriate
committee thereof in its sole discretion. Except as provided in Section 4, Employee must be employed by the Company at the time of the
bonus payout for the Annual Performance Bonus to be deemed as having been earned. The Company shall deduct from the Annual Performance
Bonus all amounts required to be deducted or withheld under applicable law or under any employee benefit plan in which Employee participates.

plans shall govern).

in furtherance of the Company s business in accordance with the Company s policies with respect thereto as in effect from

4. Payments
Upon Termination . 

(a) Definition
of Accrued Obligations . For purposes of this Agreement, Accrued Obligations means: 

(i) the
portion of Employee s Base Salary that has accrued prior to any termination of Employee s employment with Company and has
not yet been paid; 

(ii) accrued
but unused paid time off, if any, pursuant to the Company s standard policy and practices; and 

(iii) the
amount of any expenses properly incurred by Employee on behalf of the Company prior to any such termination and not yet reimbursed. Employee s
entitlement to any other compensation or benefit under any Company plan shall be governed by and determined in accordance with the terms
of such plans, except as otherwise specified in this Agreement. 

(b) Termination
by the Company for Cause . If Employee s employment hereunder is terminated by the Company for Cause, then the Company shall
pay the Accrued Obligations to Employee within the time provided by law and the Company shall have no further obligations to Employee
under this Agreement. 

(c) Termination
by Employee Without Good Reason . If Employee s employment hereunder is terminated by Employee without Good Reason, then the
Company shall pay the Accrued Obligations to Employee within the time provided by law and the Company shall have no further obligations
to Employee under this Agreement. 

(d) Termination
as a Result of Employee s Disability or Death . If Employee s employment hereunder terminates as a result of Employee s
Disability or death, the Company shall pay to Employee (or Employee s estate) within the time provided by law (i) the Accrued Obligations;
(ii) any accrued and unpaid Annual Performance Bonus for the prior fiscal year; and (iii) the Pro Rated Bonus (as defined below) and,
shall have no further obligations with respect to any benefit or compensation under this Agreement to Employee hereunder. As used in
this Section 4, Pro Rated Bonus shall mean an amount in cash equal to the target Annual Performance Bonus for which Employee
would have been eligible with respect to the year in which termination of Employee s employment occurs multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of days during which Employee is employed by the Company during the year of termination and the
denominator of which is 365. 

(e) Termination
by the Company Without Cause or by Employee For Good Reason; Change in Control . In the event that Employee s employment is
terminated by action of the Company other than for Cause, or Employee terminates Employee s employment for Good Reason, or in the
event that a Change in Control of the Company (as defined below) occurs and within a period of one (1) year following the Change in Control,
or ninety (90) days preceding the earlier to occur of a Change in Control or the execution of a definitive agreement the consummation
of which would result in a Change in Control, Employee s employment is terminated other than for Cause, or during such period of
time Employee terminates Employee s employment for Good Reason, then, in addition to the Accrued Obligations and any accrued and
unpaid Annual Performance Bonus for the prior fiscal year, Employee shall receive the following, subject to the terms and conditions
described in Section 4(f). 

- 5 - 

(i) Severance
Payments . A lump sum payment in an amount equal to twenty-four (24) months in value of Employee s then-current Base Salary,
less all customary and required taxes and employment- related deductions, which payment shall be made in the first payroll following
the date on which the Release required by Section 4(f) becomes effective and non-revocable. 

(ii) Bonus .
A lump sum payment equal to the then target Annual Performance Bonus amount multiplied by 1.0, after deduction of all amounts required
to be deducted or withheld under applicable law (which payment shall be made in the first payroll following the effective date of the
Release required by Section 4(f)). Under this Section 4(e)(ii), payment of the Annual Performance Bonus does not require the employee
to be employed through the time of bonus payout. 

(iii) Equity
Acceleration . On the effective date of the Release required by Section 4(f), Employee shall become fully vested in any and all unvested
equity awards outstanding as of the date of Employee s termination and this provision shall supersede any vesting acceleration
provision contained in any equity award agreement outstanding on the Effective Date of this Agreement. 

(iv) Benefits
Payments . Upon completion of appropriate forms and subject to applicable terms and conditions under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended COBRA ), the Company shall continue to provide Employee medical insurance coverage
to the same extent that such insurance continues to be provided to similarly situated executives at the time of Employee s termination
with the total cost of the regular premium for such benefits to be paid by the Company (the COBRA Payment ), until the earlier
to occur of: (i) twelve (12) months following Employee s termination date, or (ii) the date Employee becomes eligible for medical
benefits with another employer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Employee s COBRA Payment would cause the applicable group health
plan to be discriminatory and, therefore, result in adverse tax consequences to Employee, the Company shall, in lieu of the COBRA Payment,
provide Employee with an equivalent monthly cash payment, minus deduction of all amounts required to be deducted or withheld under applicable
law, for any period of time Employee is eligible to receive the COBRA Payment. Employee shall bear full responsibility for applying for
COBRA continuation coverage and the Company shall have no obligation to provide Employee such coverage if Employee fails to elect COBRA
benefits in a timely fashion. 

(v) Change
in Control Defined . As used herein, a Change in Control shall have the meaning set forth in the Company s
Amended and Restated 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the Equity Plan ), or any amended or new Equity Plan(s) as may be approved
by the shareholders from time to time; provided, however, that for purposes of this Agreement a Change in Control shall be deemed to
have occurred in any transaction described in subsections (i) or (ii) of Section 2.1(h) of the Equity Plan in which a majority of the
members of the board of directors of the continuing, surviving or successor entity, or parent thereof, immediately after such transaction
is comprised of Incumbent Directors (as defined in the Equity Plan). 

- 6 - 

Payment
of the above-described severance payments and benefits are expressly conditioned on Employee s execution without revocation of
the Release required under Section 4(f), and return of Company property under Section 6. 

(f) Execution
of Release of Claims . The Company shall not be obligated to pay Employee any of the severance payments or benefits described in this
Section 4 unless and until Employee has executed (without revocation) a release of claims as described below (the Release ).
The Release shall contain reasonable and customary provisions including a general release of claims against the Company and its affiliated
entities and each of their officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys and representatives as well as provisions concerning, among
other things and when consistent with then-applicable law, non-disparagement, confidentiality, and continued cooperation. The Release
must be provided to Employee not later than fifteen (15) days following the date of termination of Employee s employment by the
Company and executed by Employee and returned to the Company within sixty (60) days after receipt. If Employee fails or refuses to return
the Release within such 60-day period, Employee s severance payments and benefits to be paid hereunder shall be forfeited. 

(g) No
Other Payments or Benefits Owing . Except as expressly set forth herein, the payments and benefits set forth in this Section 4: (a)
shall be the sole amounts owing to Employee upon termination of Employee s employment for the reasons set forth above, and Employee
shall not be eligible for any other payments or other forms of compensation or benefits; (b) shall be the sole remedy, if any, available
to Employee in the event that Employee brings any claim against the Company relating to the termination of Employee s employment
under this Agreement; and (c) shall not be subject to set-off by the Company or any obligation on the part of Employee to mitigate or
to offset compensation earned by Employee in other pursuits after termination of employment, other than as specified herein with respect
medical benefits provided by another employer. 

5. Proprietary
Information . Employee expressly acknowledges that: (a) there are competitive and proprietary aspects of the business of the Company;
(b) during the course of Employee s employment, the Company shall furnish, disclose or make available to Employee confidential
and proprietary information and may provide Employee with unique and specialized training; (c) such confidential information and training
have been developed and shall be developed by the Company through the expenditure of substantial time, effort and money, and could be
used by Employee to compete with the Company; and (d) in the course of Employee s employment, Employee shall be introduced to customers
and others with important relationships to the Company, and any and all goodwill created through such introductions belongs
exclusively to the Company, including, but not limited to, any goodwill created as a result of direct or indirect contacts or relationships
between Employee and any customers of the Company. In light of the foregoing acknowledgements, and as a condition of continued employment
hereunder, Employee hereby reaffirms, confirms and approves the Confidentiality and Assignment of Creative Works Agreement previously
entered into or entered into on the date hereof as a binding obligation of the Employee, enforceable in accordance with its terms. Employee s
obligations under the Confidentiality and Assignment of Creative Works Agreement shall survive termination. 

- 7 - 

6. Property
and Records . Upon the termination of Employee s employment, for any reason or for no reason, or if the Company otherwise requests,
Employee shall: (a) return to Company all tangible business information and copies thereof (regardless how such confidential information
or copies are maintained), and (b) deliver to the Company any property of the Company which may be in Employee s possession, including,
but not limited to, devices, smart phones, laptops, cell phones (the foregoing, electronic devices ), products, materials,
memoranda, notes, records, reports or other documents or photocopies of the same. Employee may retain copies of any exclusively personal
data contained in or on the Company-owned electronic devices returned to the Company pursuant to the foregoing. The foregoing notwithstanding,
Employee understands and agrees that the Company property belongs exclusively to the Company, it should be used for Company business,
and Employee has no reasonable expectation of privacy on any Company property or with respect to any information stored thereon. 

7. Cooperation .
During and after Employee s employment, Employee shall fully cooperate with the Company to the extent reasonable in the defense
or prosecution of any claims or actions now in existence or which may be brought in the future against or on behalf of the Company (other
than claims directly or indirectly against Employee) which relate to events or occurrences that transpired while Employee was employed
by the Company. Employee s cooperation in connection with such claims or actions shall include, but not be limited to, being available
to meet with counsel to prepare for discovery or trial and to act as a witness on behalf of the Company at mutually convenient times.
During and after Employee s employment, Employee also shall fully cooperate with the Company to the extent reasonable in connection
with any investigation or review of any federal, state or local regulatory authority as any such investigation or review relates to events
or occurrences that transpired while Employee was employed by the Company. The Company shall reimburse Employee for any reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with the Employee s performance of obligations pursuant to this section. 

8. Code
Sections 409A and 280G . 

(a) In
the event that the payments or benefits set forth in Section 4 of this Agreement constitute non- qualified deferred compensation 
subject to Section 409A, then the following conditions apply to such payments or benefits: 

(i) Any
termination of Employee s employment triggering payment of benefits under Section 4 must constitute a separation from service 
under Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code and Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(h) before distribution of such benefits can commence. To the
extent that the termination of Employee s employment does not constitute a separation of service under Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i)
of the Code and Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(h) (as the result of further services that are reasonably anticipated to be provided by Employee
to the Company at the time Employee s employment terminates), any such payments under Section 4 that constitute deferred compensation
under Section 409A shall be delayed until after the date of a subsequent event constituting a separation of service under Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i)
of the Code and Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(h). For purposes of clarification, this Section 8(a) shall not cause any forfeiture of benefits
on Employee s part, but shall only act as a delay until such time as a separation from service occurs. 

- 8 - 

(ii) Notwithstanding
any other provision with respect to the timing of payments under Section 4 if, at the time of Employee s termination, Employee
is deemed to be a specified employee of the Company (within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code), then
limited only to the extent necessary to comply with the requirements of Section 409A, any payments to which Employee may become entitled
under Section 4 which are subject to Section 409A (and not otherwise exempt from its application) shall be withheld until the first (1st)
business day of the seventh (7th) month following the termination of Employee s employment, at which time Employee shall be paid
an aggregate amount equal to the accumulated, but unpaid, payments otherwise due to Employee under the terms of Section 4. 

(b) It
is intended that each installment of the payments and benefits provided under Section 4 of this Agreement shall be treated as a separate
 payment for purposes of Section 409A. Neither the Company nor Employee shall have the right to accelerate or defer the
delivery of any such payments or benefits except to the extent specifically permitted or required by Section 409A. 

(c) Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall be interpreted and at all times administered in a manner
that avoids the inclusion of compensation in income under Section 409A, or the payment of increased taxes, excise taxes or other penalties
under Section 409A. The parties intend this Agreement to be in compliance with Section 409A. Employee acknowledges and agrees that the
Company does not guarantee the tax treatment or tax consequences associated with any payment or benefit arising under this Agreement,
including but not limited to consequences related to Section 409A. 

(d) In
the event the benefits provided by this Agreement, when aggregated with any other payments or benefits received by Employee, would (i)
constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and (ii) but for this sentence, be subject
to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the Excise Tax ), then such Payment shall be reduced
to the Reduced Amount. The Reduced Amount shall be either (x) the largest portion of the Payment that would result in no
portion of the Payment being subject to the Excise Tax or (y) the largest portion, up to and including the total, of the Payment, whichever
amount, after taking into account all applicable federal, state and local employment taxes, income taxes, and the Excise Tax (all computed
at the highest applicable marginal rate), results in Employee receipt, on an after-tax basis, of the greater amount of the Payment notwithstanding
that all or some portion of the Payment may be subject to the Excise Tax. If a reduction in payments or benefits constituting parachute
payments is necessary to accomplish the purpose of this Section 8(d), reduction shall occur at the election, in writing, of the
Employee (provided, however, that such election shall be subject to Company approval if made on or after the effective date of the event
that triggers the Payment) and may reduce cash payments, cancel accelerated vesting of stock award, and/or reduce employee benefits in
any order or combination that maximizes the amount of the Reduced Amount. In the event that acceleration of vesting of stock award compensation
is to be reduced, such acceleration of vesting shall be cancelled in the reverse order of the date of grant of Employee s stock
awards unless Employee elects in writing a different order for cancellation. The accounting firm engaged by the Company for general audit
purposes as of the day prior to the effective date of the Change in Control shall perform the foregoing calculations. If the accounting
firm so engaged by the Company is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the Change in Control,
then the Company shall appoint a nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder. The Company shall
bear all expenses with respect to the determinations by such accounting firm required to be made hereunder. The accounting firm engaged
to make the determinations hereunder shall provide its calculations, together with detailed supporting documentation, to Employee and
the Company within fifteen (15) calendar days after the date on which Employee s right to a Payment is triggered (if requested
at that time by Employee or the Company) or such other time as requested by Employee or the Company. If the accounting firm determines
that no Excise Tax is payable with respect to a Payment, either before or after the application of the Reduced Amount, it shall furnish
Employee and the Company with an opinion reasonably acceptable to Employee that no Excise Tax will be imposed with respect to such Payment.
Any good faith determinations of the accounting firm made hereunder shall be final, binding and conclusive upon Employee and the Company.

EMPLOYMENT
AGREEMENT 

This
Employment Agreement (this Agreement is made and entered into this 8th day of November, 2024 (the Effective Date by and between Evofem Biosciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation Company ), and Saundra Pelletier Employee ). 

1.
 Roles and Duties . 

(a)
 Chief Executive Officer Role . Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Company shall employ Employee as its Chief
Executive Officer reporting to the Company s Board of Directors Board ). The Employee shall have such duties and
responsibilities as are reasonably determined by the Board and are consistent with the duties customarily performed by a Chief Executive
Officer of a similarly situated company in the United States. Employee accepts such employment upon the terms and conditions set forth
herein and agrees to perform such duties and discharge such responsibilities to the best of Employee s ability. During Employee s
employment, Employee shall devote all of Employee s business time and energies to the business and affairs of the Company. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing herein shall preclude Employee from (i) performing services for such other companies as the Company may designate
or permit; (ii) serving, with the prior written consent of the Company s Board of Directors Board ), which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, as a member of the board of directors or advisory boards (or their equivalents in the case of a non-corporate
entity) of non-competing businesses or charitable, educational or civic organizations; (iii) engaging in charitable activities and community
affairs; and (iv) managing Employee s personal investments and affairs; provided, however, that the activities set out in clauses (i),
(ii), (iii) and (iv) shall be limited by Employee so as not to materially interfere, individually or in the aggregate, with the performance
of Employee s duties and responsibilities hereunder. 

(b)
 Board Membership . Executive shall serve as a member of the Board during Executive s employment hereunder until the term
of Executive s directorship expires and Executive is not re-elected or earlier resigns or is removed from the Board. During the
Term (as defined below), the Company or the applicable Board committee will recommend to the Board for nomination, and the Board shall
nominate the Executive for reelection to the Board. Executive s service as a Board member shall be without further compensation.
At such time as Executive s service to the Company is terminated for any reason or no reason, Executive agrees to resign as a member
of the Board effective upon such termination of service, unless the Board, in its discretion, requests Executive to not so resign in
writing.

upon the earliest to occur of the following and in accordance with the following: 

(i)
 Death . Immediately upon Employee s death; 

- 1 - 

(ii)
 Termination by the Company . 

(A)
If because of Employee s Disability (as defined below in Section 2(c)), written notice by the Company to Employee that Employee s
employment is being terminated as a result of Employee s Disability, which termination shall be effective on the date of such notice
or such later date as specified in writing by the Company; 

(B)
If for Cause (as defined below in Section 2(d)), written notice by the Company to Employee that Employee s employment is being
terminated for Cause, which termination shall be effective on the date of such notice or such later date as specified in writing by the
Company; provided that if prior to the effective date of such termination Employee has cured the circumstances giving rise to the Cause
(if capable of being cured as provided in Section 2(d)), then such termination shall not be effective; or 

(C)
If by the Company for reasons other than under Sections 2(b)(ii)(A) or (B), written notice by the Company to Employee that Employee s
employment is being terminated, which termination shall be effective thirty (30) days after the date of such notice. 

(iii)
 Termination by Employee . 

(A)
If for Good Reason (as defined below in Section 2(e)), written notice by Employee to the Company that Employee is terminating Employee s
employment for Good Reason and that sets forth the factual basis supporting the alleged Good Reason, which termination shall be effective
thirty (30) days after the date of such notice; provided that if prior to the effective date of such termination the Company has cured
the circumstances giving rise to the Good Reason if capable of being cured as provided in Section 2(e), then such termination shall not
be effective; or 

(B)
If without Good Reason, written notice by Employee to the Company that Employee is terminating Employee s employment, which termination
shall be effective no fewer than thirty (30) days after the date of such notice unless such notice period is waived, in whole or in part,
by the Company. 

Notwithstanding
anything in this Section 2(b), the Company may at any point, under the conditions set forth in Section 2(b)(ii)(B), terminate Employee s
employment for Cause prior to the effective date of any other termination contemplated hereunder; provided that if prior to the effective
date of such for-Cause termination Employee has cured the circumstances giving rise to the Cause (if capable of being cured as provided
in Section 2(d)), then such termination shall not be effective. 

(c)
 Definition of Disability. For purposes of this Agreement, Disability shall mean Employee s incapacity
or inability to perform Employee s duties and responsibilities as contemplated herein by reason of a medically determinable mental
or physical impairment for one hundred twenty (120) days or more within any one (1) year period (cumulative or consecutive), which impairment
can reasonably be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than six (6) months. 

- 2 - 

The
determination that Employee is disabled hereunder, if disputed by the parties, shall be resolved by a physician reasonably satisfactory
to Employee and the Company, at the Company s expense, and the determination of such physician shall be final and binding upon
both Employee and the Company. Employee hereby consents to such examination and consultation by a physician. The Company will keep all
information it receives as a result of such inquiry and determination confidential and will not use it for any purpose other than in
connection with exercising its rights under this Agreement. 

(d)
 Definition of Cause. As used herein, Cause shall mean: (i) Employee s conviction of (A) a felony
or (B) any misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, deceit, dishonesty or fraud; (ii) Employee s willful failure or refusal to comply
with lawful directions of Employee s supervisor or the Board, which failure or refusal continues for more than five (5) business
days after written notice is given to Employee, which notice sets forth in reasonable detail the nature of such failure or refusal; (iii)
willful and material breach by Employee of a material written Company policy or this Agreement, provided Employee does not cure such
breach within five (5) business days after receiving written notice of the alleged breach; or (iv) misconduct by Employee that materially
damages the Company or any of its affiliates. Except in the case of (ii) above, it is not necessary that the Company s finding
of Cause occur prior to Employee s termination of service. If the Company determines, subsequent to Employee s termination
of service, that prior to Employee s termination, Employee engaged in conduct which would constitute Cause (other
than pursuant to (ii) above), then Employee shall have no right to any benefit or compensation under this Agreement. 

(e)
 Definition of Good Reason. As used herein, Good Reason shall mean: (i) relocation of Employee s
principal business location to a location more than fifty (50) miles from Employee s then-current business location; (ii) a material
diminution in Employee s duties, authority or responsibilities, which shall include, without limitation, Employee no longer performing
similar functions associated with Employee s services as Chief Executive Officer of a Company registered under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended; (iii) a reduction in Employee s then in effect Base Salary by more than 10 and in a manner inconsistent
with other employees of the Company having similar authority; or (iv) willful and material breach by the Company of its covenants and/or
obligations under this Agreement; provided that, in each of the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv) (A) Employee provides Company with
written notice that Employee intends to terminate Employee s employment hereunder for one of the grounds set forth in this Section
2(e) within thirty (30) days of such ground occurring, (B) if such ground is capable of being cured, Company has failed to cure such
ground within a period of thirty (30) days from the date of such written notice, and (C) Employee terminates by written notice Employee s
employment within sixty-five (65) days from the date that Employee provides the notice contemplated by clause (A) of this Section 2(e).
For purposes of clarification, the above-listed conditions shall apply separately to each occurrence of Good Reason, and failure to adhere
to such conditions in the event of Good Reason shall not disqualify Employee from asserting Good Reason for any subsequent occurrence
of Good Reason. For purposes of this Agreement, Good Reason shall be interpreted in a manner, and limited to the extent
necessary, so that it shall not cause adverse tax consequences for either party with respect to Section 409A Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code and any successor statute, regulation and guidance thereto.

of such benefit plans shall govern). 

- 4 -

incurred by Employee in furtherance of the Company s business in accordance with the Company s policies with respect thereto
as in effect from time to time. Employee must submit any request for reimbursement no later than ninety (90) days following the date
that such business expense is incurred. All reimbursements provided under this Agreement shall be made or provided in accordance with
the requirements of Section 409A including, where applicable, the requirement that (i) any reimbursement is for expenses incurred during

4.
 Payments Upon Termination . 

(a)
Definition of Accrued Obligations. For purposes of this Agreement, Accrued Obligations means: 

(i)
the portion of Employee s Base Salary that has accrued prior to any termination of Employee s employment with Company and
has not yet been paid; 

(ii)
accrued but unused paid time off, if any, pursuant to the Company s standard policy and practices; and 

(iii)
the amount of any expenses properly incurred by Employee on behalf of the Company prior to any such termination and not yet reimbursed.
Employee s entitlement to any other compensation or benefit under any Company plan shall be governed by and determined in accordance
with the terms of such plans, except as otherwise specified in this Agreement. 

(b)

(c)
 Termination by Employee Without Good Reason . If Employee s employment hereunder is terminated by Employee without Good Reason,
then the Company shall pay the Accrued Obligations to Employee within the time provided by law and the Company shall have no further
obligations to Employee under this Agreement.

of termination and the denominator of which is 365. 

- 5 - 

(e)
 Termination by the Company Without Cause or by Employee For Good Reason; Change in Control . In the event that Employee s
employment is terminated by action of the Company other than for Cause, or Employee terminates Employee s employment for Good Reason,
or in the event that a Change in Control of the Company (as defined below) occurs and within a period of one (1) year following the Change
in Control, or ninety (90) days preceding the earlier to occur of a Change in Control or the execution of a definitive agreement the
consummation of which would result in a Change in Control, Employee s employment is terminated other than for Cause, or during
such period of time Employee terminates Employee s employment for Good Reason, then, in addition to the Accrued Obligations and
any accrued and unpaid Annual Performance Bonus for the prior fiscal year, Employee shall receive the following, subject to the terms
and conditions described in Section 4(f). 

(i)
 Severance Payments . A lump sum payment in an amount equal to thirty-six (36) months in value of Employee s then-current
Base Salary, less all customary and required taxes and employment- related deductions, which payment shall be made in the first payroll
following the date on which the Release required by Section 4(f) becomes effective and non-revocable. 

(ii)
 Bonus . A lump sum payment equal to the then target Annual Performance Bonus amount multiplied by 1.0, after deduction of all amounts
required to be deducted or withheld under applicable law (which payment shall be made in the first payroll following the effective date
of the Release required by Section 4(f)). Under this Section 4(e)(ii), payment of the Annual Performance Bonus does not require the employee
to be employed through the time of bonus payout. 

(iii)
 Equity Acceleration . On the effective date of the Release required by Section 4(f), Employee shall become fully vested in any
and all unvested equity awards outstanding as of the date of Employee s termination and this provision shall supersede any vesting
acceleration provision contained in any equity award agreement outstanding on the Effective Date of this Agreement. 

(iv)
 Benefits Payments . Upon completion of appropriate forms and subject to applicable terms and conditions under the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended COBRA ), the Company shall continue to provide Employee medical insurance
coverage to the same extent that such insurance continues to be provided to similarly situated executives at the time of Employee s
termination with the total cost of the regular premium for such benefits to be paid by the Company (the COBRA Payment ),
until the earlier to occur of: (i) twelve (12) months following Employee s termination date, or (ii) the date Employee becomes
eligible for medical benefits with another employer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Employee s COBRA Payment would cause the
applicable group health plan to be discriminatory and, therefore, result in adverse tax consequences to Employee, the Company shall,
in lieu of the COBRA Payment, provide Employee with an equivalent monthly cash payment, minus deduction of all amounts required to be
deducted or withheld under applicable law, for any period of time Employee is eligible to receive the COBRA Payment. Employee shall bear
full responsibility for applying for COBRA continuation coverage and the Company shall have no obligation to provide Employee such coverage
if Employee fails to elect COBRA benefits in a timely fashion. 

- 6 - 

(v)
 Change in Control Defined . As used herein, a Change in Control shall have the meaning set forth in
the Company s Amended and Restated 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the Equity Plan ); or any amended or new Equity Plan(s)
as may be approved by the shareholders from time to time; provided, however, that for purposes of this Agreement a Change in Control
shall be deemed to have occurred in any transaction described in subsections (i) or (ii) of Section 2.1(h) of the Equity Plan in which
a majority of the members of the board of directors of the continuing, surviving or successor entity, or parent thereof, immediately
after such transaction is comprised of Incumbent Directors (as defined in the Equity Plan). 

Payment
of the above-described severance payments and benefits are expressly conditioned on Employee s execution without revocation of
the Release required under Section 4(f), and return of Company property under Section 6. 

(f)
 Execution of Release of Claims . The Company shall not be obligated to pay Employee any of the severance payments or benefits described
in this Section 4 unless and until Employee has executed (without revocation) a release of claims as described below (the Release ).
The Release shall contain reasonable and customary provisions including a general release of claims against the Company and its affiliated
entities and each of their officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys and representatives as well as provisions concerning, among
other things and when consistent with then-applicable law, non-disparagement, confidentiality, and continued cooperation. The Release
must be provided to Employee not later than fifteen (15) days following the date of termination of Employee s employment by the
Company and executed by Employee and returned to the Company within sixty (60) days after receipt. If Employee fails or refuses to return
the Release within such 60-day period, Employee s severance payments and benefits to be paid hereunder shall be forfeited. 

(g)
 No Other Payments or Benefits Owing . Except as expressly set forth herein, the payments and benefits set forth in this Section
4: (a) shall be the sole amounts owing to Employee upon termination of Employee s employment for the reasons set forth above, and
Employee shall not be eligible for any other payments or other forms of compensation or benefits; (b) shall be the sole remedy, if any,
available to Employee in the event that Employee brings any claim against the Company relating to the termination of Employee s
employment under this Agreement; and (c) shall not be subject to set-off by the Company or any obligation on the part of Employee to
mitigate or to offset compensation earned by Employee in other pursuits after termination of employment, other than as specified herein
with respect medical benefits provided by another employer. 

- 7 - 

5.
 Proprietary Information . Employee expressly acknowledges that: (a) there are competitive and proprietary aspects of the business
of the Company; (b) during the course of Employee s employment, the Company shall furnish, disclose or make available to Employee
confidential and proprietary information and may provide Employee with unique and specialized training; (c) such confidential information
and training have been developed and shall be developed by the Company through the expenditure of substantial time, effort and money,
and could be used by Employee to compete with the Company; and (d) in the course of Employee s employment, Employee shall be introduced
to customers and others with important relationships to the Company, and any and all goodwill created through such introductions
belongs exclusively to the Company, including, but not limited to, any goodwill created as a result of direct or indirect contacts or
relationships between Employee and any customers of the Company. In light of the foregoing acknowledgements, and as a condition of continued
employment hereunder, Employee hereby reaffirms, confirms and approves the Confidentiality and Assignment of Creative Works Agreement
previously entered into or entered into on the date hereof as a binding obligation of the Employee, enforceable in accordance with its
terms. Employee s obligations under the Confidentiality and Assignment of Creative Works Agreement shall survive termination. 

6.
 Property and Records . Upon the termination of Employee s employment, for any reason or for no reason, or if the Company
otherwise requests, Employee shall: (a) return to Company all tangible business information and copies thereof (regardless how such confidential
information or copies are maintained), and (b) deliver to the Company any property of the Company which may be in Employee s possession,
including, but not limited to, devices, smart phones, laptops, cell phones (the foregoing, electronic devices ), products,
materials, memoranda, notes, records, reports or other documents or photocopies of the same. Employee may retain copies of any exclusively
personal data contained in or on the Company-owned electronic devices returned to the Company pursuant to the foregoing. The foregoing
notwithstanding, Employee understands and agrees that the Company property belongs exclusively to the Company, it should be used for
Company business, and Employee has no reasonable expectation of privacy on any Company property or with respect to any information stored
thereon. 

7.
 Cooperation . During and after Employee s employment, Employee shall fully cooperate with the Company to the extent reasonable
in the defense or prosecution of any claims or actions now in existence or which may be brought in the future against or on behalf of
the Company (other than claims directly or indirectly against Employee) which relate to events or occurrences that transpired while Employee
was employed by the Company. Employee s cooperation in connection with such claims or actions shall include, but not be limited
to, being available to meet with counsel to prepare for discovery or trial and to act as a witness on behalf of the Company at mutually
convenient times. During and after Employee s employment, Employee also shall fully cooperate with the Company to the extent reasonable
in connection with any investigation or review of any federal, state or local regulatory authority as any such investigation or review
relates to events or occurrences that transpired while Employee was employed by the Company. The Company shall reimburse Employee for
any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the Employee s performance of obligations pursuant to this section.

8.
 Code Sections 409A and 280G . 

(a)
In the event that the payments or benefits set forth in Section 4 of this Agreement constitute non- qualified deferred compensation 
subject to Section 409A, then the following conditions apply to such payments or benefits: 

(i)
Any termination of Employee s employment triggering payment of benefits under Section 4 must constitute a separation from
service under Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code and Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(h) before distribution of such benefits can
commence. To the extent that the termination of Employee s employment does not constitute a separation of service under Section
409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code and Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(h) (as the result of further services that are reasonably anticipated to
be provided by Employee to the Company at the time Employee s employment terminates), any such payments under Section 4 that constitute
deferred compensation under Section 409A shall be delayed until after the date of a subsequent event constituting a separation of service
under Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code and Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(h). For purposes of clarification, this Section 8(a) shall
not cause any forfeiture of benefits on Employee s part, but shall only act as a delay until such time as a separation from
service occurs. 

(ii)
Notwithstanding any other provision with respect to the timing of payments under Section 4 if, at the time of Employee s termination,
Employee is deemed to be a specified employee of the Company (within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code),
then limited only to the extent necessary to comply with the requirements of Section 409A, any payments to which Employee may become
entitled under Section 4 which are subject to Section 409A (and not otherwise exempt from its application) shall be withheld until the
first (1st) business day of the seventh (7th) month following the termination of Employee s employment, at which time Employee
shall be paid an aggregate amount equal to the accumulated, but unpaid, payments otherwise due to Employee under the terms of Section
4. 

(b)
It is intended that each installment of the payments and benefits provided under Section 4 of this Agreement shall be treated as a separate
 payment for purposes of Section 409A. Neither the Company nor Employee shall have the right to accelerate or defer the
delivery of any such payments or benefits except to the extent specifically permitted or required by Section 409A. 

(c)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall be interpreted and at all times administered
in a manner that avoids the inclusion of compensation in income under Section 409A, or the payment of increased taxes, excise taxes or
other penalties under Section 409A. The parties intend this Agreement to be in compliance with Section 409A. Employee acknowledges and
agrees that the Company does not guarantee the tax treatment or tax consequences associated with any payment or benefit arising under
this Agreement, including but not limited to consequences related to Section 409A. 

- 9 - 

(d)
In the event the benefits provided by this Agreement, when aggregated with any other payments or benefits received by Employee, would
(i) constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and (ii) but for this sentence, be subject
to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the Excise Tax ), then such Payment shall be reduced
to the Reduced Amount. The Reduced Amount shall be either (x) the largest portion of the Payment that would result in no
portion of the Payment being subject to the Excise Tax or (y) the largest portion, up to and including the total, of the Payment, whichever
amount, after taking into account all applicable federal, state and local employment taxes, income taxes, and the Excise Tax (all computed
at the highest applicable marginal rate), results in Employee receipt, on an after-tax basis, of the greater amount of the Payment notwithstanding
that all or some portion of the Payment may be subject to the Excise Tax. If a reduction in payments or benefits constituting parachute
payments is necessary to accomplish the purpose of this Section 8(d), reduction shall occur at the election, in writing, of the
Employee (provided, however, that such election shall be subject to Company approval if made on or after the effective date of the event
that triggers the Payment) and may reduce cash payments, cancel accelerated vesting of stock award, and/or reduce employee benefits in
any order or combination that maximizes the amount of the Reduced Amount. In the event that acceleration of vesting of stock award compensation
is to be reduced, such acceleration of vesting shall be cancelled in the reverse order of the date of grant of Employee s stock
awards unless Employee elects in writing a different order for cancellation. The accounting firm engaged by the Company for general audit
purposes as of the day prior to the effective date of the Change in Control shall perform the foregoing calculations. If the accounting
firm so engaged by the Company is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the Change in Control,
then the Company shall appoint a nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder. The Company shall
bear all expenses with respect to the determinations by such accounting firm required to be made hereunder. The accounting firm engaged
to make the determinations hereunder shall provide its calculations, together with detailed supporting documentation, to Employee and
the Company within fifteen (15) calendar days after the date on which Employee s right to a Payment is triggered (if requested
at that time by Employee or the Company) or such other time as requested by Employee or the Company. If the accounting firm determines
that no Excise Tax is payable with respect to a Payment, either before or after the application of the Reduced Amount, it shall furnish
Employee and the Company with an opinion reasonably acceptable to Employee that no Excise Tax will be imposed with respect to such Payment.
Any good faith determinations of the accounting firm made hereunder shall be final, binding and conclusive upon Employee and the Company.
