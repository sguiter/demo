TRUST 

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. TRUST ORGANIZATION AND PROVISIONS 

Permianville Royalty Trust (the Trust ),
previously known as Enduro Royalty Trust, is a Delaware statutory trust formed in May 2011 pursuant to a trust agreement (as subsequently
amended and restated, the Trust Agreement among Enduro Resource Partners LLC Enduro ), as trustor, The Bank
of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (the Trustee ), as trustee, and Wilmington Trust Company (the Delaware Trustee ),
as Delaware Trustee. 

The Trust was created to acquire and hold for the
benefit of the Trust unitholders a net profits interest representing the right to receive 80 of the net profits from the sale of oil
and natural gas production from certain properties in the states of Texas, Louisiana and New Mexico held by Enduro as of the date of the
conveyance of the net profits interest to the Trust (the Net Profits Interest ). The properties in which the Trust holds
the Net Profits Interest are referred to as the Underlying Properties. 

In connection with the closing of the initial public
offering in November 2011, Enduro contributed the Net Profits Interest to the Trust in exchange for 33,000,000 units of beneficial
interest in the Trust (the Trust Units ). On August 31, 2018, COERT Holdings 1 LLC COERT or the Sponsor acquired from Enduro the Underlying Properties and all of the outstanding Trust Units owned by Enduro (the Sale Transaction ).
In connection with the Sale Transaction, COERT assumed all of Enduro s obligations under the Trust Agreement and other instruments
to which Enduro and the Trustee were parties. As of September 30, 2024, the Sponsor owned 7,363,961 Trust Units, or 22 of the issued
and outstanding Trust Units. 

The Net Profits Interest is passive in nature and
neither the Trust nor the Trustee has any management control over or responsibility for costs relating to the operation of the Underlying
Properties. The Trust Agreement provides, among other provisions, that: 

the Trust s business activities are limited to owning the Net Profits Interest and any activity reasonably related to such ownership,
including activities required or permitted by the terms of the Conveyance of Net Profits Interest, dated effective as of July 1,
2011 (as supplemented and amended to date, the Conveyance ). As a result, the Trust is not permitted to acquire other oil
and natural gas properties or net profits interests or otherwise to engage in activities beyond those necessary for the conservation and
protection of the Net Profits Interest; 

the Trust may dispose of all or any material part of the assets of the Trust (including the sale of the Net Profits Interest) if approved
by at least 75 of the outstanding Trust Units; 

the Sponsor may sell a divided or undivided portion of its interests in the Underlying Properties, free from and unburdened by the
Net Profits Interest, if approved by at least 50 of the outstanding Trust Units at a meeting of Trust unitholders; 

the Trustee will make monthly cash distributions to unitholders (Note 5); 

the Trustee may create a cash reserve to pay for future liabilities of the Trust; 

the Trustee may authorize the Trust to borrow money to pay administrative or incidental expenses of the Trust that exceed its cash
on hand and available reserves. No further distributions will be made to Trust unitholders until such amounts borrowed are repaid; and 

the Trust is not subject to any pre-set termination provisions based on a maximum volume of oil or natural gas to be produced or the
passage of time. The Trust will dissolve upon the earliest to occur of the following: 

the Trust, upon approval of the holders of at least 75 of the outstanding Trust Units, sells the Net Profits Interest; 

5

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 (unaudited) 

the annual cash proceeds received by the Trust attributable to the Net Profits Interest are less than 2 million for each of any two
consecutive years; 

the holders of at least 75 of the outstanding Trust Units vote in favor of dissolution; or 

the Trust is judicially dissolved. 

2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

The Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Trust
Corpus as of December 31, 2023, which has been derived from audited financial statements, and the unaudited interim financial statements
as of September 30, 2024 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 have been prepared pursuant to
the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). Accordingly, certain information and disclosures
normally included in annual financial statements have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations. Therefore,
these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Trust s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K ). 

In the opinion of the Trustee, the accompanying
unaudited financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation
of the interim periods presented and include all the disclosures necessary to make the information presented not misleading. These interim
results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. 

The preparation of financial statements requires
the Trustee to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Although the Trustee believes that these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ
from those estimates. 

The Trust uses the modified cash basis of accounting
to report Trust receipts of income from the Net Profits Interest and payments of expenses incurred. The Net Profits Interest represents
the right to receive revenues (oil and natural gas sales), less direct operating expenses (lease operating expenses and production and
property taxes) and development expenses of the Underlying Properties, multiplied by 80 . Cash distributions of the Trust are made based
on the amount of cash received by the Trust pursuant to terms of the Conveyance creating the Net Profits Interest. 

Under the terms of the Conveyance, the monthly
Net Profits Interest calculation includes oil and natural gas revenues received during the relevant month. Monthly operating expenses
and capital expenditures represent estimated incurred expenses and, as a result, represent accrued expenses as well as expenses paid during
the period. 

The financial statements of the Trust are prepared
on the following basis: 

(a) Income from Net Profits Interest is recorded when distributions are received by the Trust; 

(b) Distributions to Trust unitholders are recorded when paid by the Trust; 

(c) Trust general and administrative expenses (which includes the Trustee s fees as well as accounting, engineering, legal, and
other professional fees) are recorded when paid; 

(d) Cash reserves for Trust expenses may be established by the Trustee for certain future expenditures that would not be recorded as contingent
liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ); 

(e) Amortization of the Net Profits Interest in oil and natural gas properties is calculated on a unit-of-production basis and is charged
directly to the Trust corpus; and 

6 

PERMIANVILLE ROYALTY
TRUST 

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 (unaudited) 

(f) The Net Profits Interest in oil and natural gas properties is periodically assessed whenever events or circumstances indicate that
the aggregate value may have been impaired below its total capitalized cost based on the Underlying Properties. If an impairment loss
is indicated by the carrying amount of the assets exceeding the sum of the undiscounted expected future net cash flows of the Net Profits
Interest, then an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value
determined using discounted cash flows. Any impairment is a direct charge to the Trust Corpus. 

The
financial statements of the Trust differ from financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP because revenues are not accrued;
certain cash reserves may be established for contingencies which would not be accrued in financial statements prepared in accordance with
GAAP; general and administrative expenses are recorded when paid instead of when incurred; amortization of the net profits interest calculated
on a unit-of-production basis is charged directly to trust corpus instead of as an expense; the Trust does not record a liability or repay
any overpayment received as these will be deducted from future payments; and impairment is charged directly to the trust corpus. While
these statements differ from financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, the modified cash basis of reporting is considered
to be the most meaningful because monthly distributions to the Trust unitholders are based on net cash receipts. 

This comprehensive basis of accounting other than
GAAP corresponds to the accounting permitted for royalty trusts by the SEC as specified by Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 12:E, Financial
Statements of Royalty Trusts . 

3. NET PROFITS INTEREST IN OIL AND NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES 

The Net Profits Interest in oil and natural gas
properties was recorded at its fair value on the date of conveyance. Amortization of the Net Profits Interest in oil and natural gas properties
is calculated on a unit-of-production basis based on the Underlying Properties production and reserves. The reserves upon which
the amortization rate is based are quantity estimates that are subject to numerous uncertainties inherent in the estimation of proved
reserves. The volumes considered to be commercially recoverable fluctuate with changes in commodity prices and operating costs. These
estimates are expected to change as additional information becomes available in the future. Downward revisions in proved reserves may
result in an increased rate of amortization. Amortization is charged directly to the Trust corpus balance and does not affect the distributable
income of the Trust. Accumulated amortization as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 309,327,359 and 302,693,874,
respectively. 

The Net Profits Interest is periodically assessed
for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the current fair value based on expected future cash flows of the Underlying
Properties may be less than the carrying value of the Net Profits Interest. While the Trust did not record an impairment during the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023, future downward revisions in actual production volumes relative to current forecasts,
higher than expected operating costs, or lower than anticipated commodity prices could result in recognition of impairment in future periods. 

4. INCOME TAXES 

Federal Income Taxes 

For federal income tax purposes, the Trust is a
grantor trust and therefore is not subject to tax at the trust level. Trust unitholders are treated as owning a direct interest in the
assets of the Trust, and each Trust unitholder is taxed directly on his or her pro rata share of the income and gain attributable to the
assets of the Trust and entitled to claim his or her pro rata share of the deductions and expenses attributable to the assets of the Trust.
The income of the Trust is deemed to have been received or accrued by each unitholder at the time such income is received or accrued by
the Trust rather than when distributed by the Trust. 

7 

PERMIANVILLE ROYALTY
TRUST 

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 (unaudited) 

The deductions of the Trust consist of severance
taxes and administrative expenses. In addition, each unitholder is entitled to depletion deductions because the Net Profits Interest constitutes
 economic interests in oil and natural gas properties for federal income tax purposes. Each unitholder is entitled to amortize
the cost of the Trust Units through cost depletion over the life of the Net Profits Interest or, if greater, through percentage depletion.
Unlike cost depletion, percentage depletion is not limited to a unitholder s depletable tax basis in the Trust Units. Rather, a
unitholder could be entitled to percentage depletion as long as the applicable Underlying Properties generate gross income. 

Some Trust Units are held by a middleman, as such
term is broadly defined in U.S. Treasury Regulations (and includes custodians, nominees, certain joint owners, and brokers holding an
interest for a custodian in street name). Therefore, the Trustee considers the Trust to be a non-mortgage widely held fixed investment
trust WHFIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., 601 Travis, 16 th 
Floor, Houston, Texas 77002, telephone number (512) 236-6545, is the representative of the Trust that will provide tax information in
accordance with applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations governing the information reporting requirements of the Trust as a WHFIT. Tax information
is also posted by the Trustee at www.permianvilleroyaltytrust.com . Notwithstanding the foregoing, the middlemen holding units on
behalf of unitholders, and not the Trustee of the Trust, are solely responsible for complying with the information reporting requirements
under the U.S. Treasury Regulations with respect to such units, including the issuance of IRS Forms 1099 and certain written tax
statements. Unitholders whose units are held by middlemen should consult with such middlemen regarding the information that will be reported
to them by the middlemen with respect to the Trust Units. 

The tax consequences to a unitholder of ownership
of Trust Units will depend in part on the unitholder s tax circumstances. Unitholders should consult their tax advisors about the
federal tax consequences relating to owning the Trust Units. 

State Taxes 

The Trust s revenues are from sources in
the states of Louisiana, New Mexico, and Texas. Because it distributes all of its net income to unitholders, the Trust is not taxed at
the trust level in Louisiana or New Mexico. Although the Trust does not owe tax, the Trustee is required to file a return with Louisiana
reflecting the income and deductions of the Trust attributable to properties located in that state. Presently, Louisiana and New Mexico
tax nonresident income from real property located within that state. Louisiana and New Mexico impose a corporate income tax which may
apply to unitholders organized as corporations. 

Texas does not impose a state income tax, so the
Trust s income is not subject to income tax at the trust level in Texas. Texas imposes a franchise tax at a rate of 0.75 on gross
revenues less certain deductions for returns originally due on or after January 1, 2016, as specifically set forth in the Texas franchise
tax statutes. Entities subject to tax generally include trusts unless otherwise exempt. Trusts that receive at least 90 of their federal
gross income from designated passive sources, including royalties from mineral properties and other income from other non-operating mineral
interests, and do not receive more than 10 of their income from operating an active trade or business, generally are exempt from the
Texas franchise tax as passive entities. Although the Trust is intended to be exempt from Texas franchise tax at the trust
level as a passive entity, each unitholder that is considered a taxable entity under the Texas franchise tax would generally be required
to include its portion of Trust net income in its own Texas franchise tax computation. 

Each unitholder should consult his or her own tax
advisor regarding state tax requirements, if any, applicable to such person s ownership of Trust Units.

5. DISTRIBUTIONS TO UNITHOLDERS 

Each month, the Trustee determines the amount of
funds available for distribution to the Trust unitholders. Available funds are the excess cash, if any, received by the Trust from the
Net Profits Interest and other sources (such as interest earned on any amounts reserved by the Trustee) that month, over the Trust s
liabilities for that month, subject to adjustments for changes made by the Trustee during the month in any cash reserves established for
future liabilities of the Trust. No distributions will be made to Trust unitholders until the indebtedness created by such amounts drawn
or borrowed as advances to the Trust have been repaid in full. Distributions are made to the holders of Trust Units as of the applicable
record date (generally the last business day of each calendar month) and are payable on or before the 10th business day after the record
date.

During
the first six months of 2024, the Net Profits Interest generated positive income for several of the months in the period, which
reduced the cumulative Net Profits Interest shortfall of 1.2 million that existed as of December 31, 2023; however, because direct
operating and development expenses exceeded revenues in March and April 2024, the Net Profits Interest shortfall was 3.9 million
as of June 30, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Net Profits Interest generated positive income, which
eliminated the cumulative outstanding Net Profits Interest shortfall of 3.9 million that existed as of June 30, 2024. In July 2024,
the remaining amount of the shortfall and advances to the Trust were fully repaid, resulting in a distribution to the unitholders in August 2024
and September 2024. There was no Net Profits Interest shortfall as of September 30, 2024. 

6. TRUSTEE FEES 

Under the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Trust
pays an administrative fee of 200,000 per year to the Trustee and an annual fee of 2,000 to the Delaware Trustee. During the three-
and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Trust paid 50,000 and 150,000, respectively, to the Trustee and 0
and 0, respectively, to the Delaware Trustee pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement. 

7. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 

Distributions Paid or Declared

Overview 

Permianville Royalty Trust, a statutory trust created
in May 2011, completed its initial public offering in November 2011. The Trust s only asset and source of income is the
net profits interest representing the right to receive 80 of the net profits from the sale of oil and natural gas production from certain
properties in the states of Texas, Louisiana and New Mexico held by Enduro as of the date of the conveyance of the net profits interest
to the Trust (the Net Profits Interest ). The properties in which the Trust holds the Net Profits Interest are referred to
as the Underlying Properties. The Net Profits Interest is passive in nature and neither the Trust nor the Trustee has any
management control over or responsibility for costs relating to the operation of the Underlying Properties. Additionally, third parties
operate substantially all of the wells on the Underlying Properties and, therefore, the Sponsor is not in a position to control the timing
of development efforts, associated costs, or the rate of production of the reserves. 

On August 31, 2018, COERT completed the acquisition
from Enduro of the Underlying Properties and all of the outstanding Trust Units owned by Enduro (the Sale Transaction ).
In connection with the Sale Transaction, COERT assumed all of Enduro s obligations under the Amended and Restated Trust Agreement
of the Trust (the Trust Agreement and other instruments to which Enduro and the Trustee were parties. 

The Trust is required to make monthly cash distributions
of substantially all of its monthly cash receipts, after deducting the Trust s administrative expenses, to the holders of Trust
Units as of the applicable record date (generally the last business day of each calendar month) on or before the 10 th business
day after the record date. The Net Profits Interest is entitled to a share of the profits from and after July 1, 2011 attributable
to production occurring on or after June 1, 2011. The amount of Trust revenues and cash distributions to Trust unitholders depends
on, among other things: 

oil and natural gas sales prices; 

volumes of oil and natural gas produced and sold attributable to the Underlying Properties; 

production and development costs; 

11 

price differentials; 

potential reductions or suspensions of production; 

the amount and timing of Trust administrative expenses; and 

the establishment, increase, or decrease of reserves for approved development expenses or future liabilities of the Trust. 

Generally, the Sponsor receives cash payment for
oil production 30 to 60 days after it is produced and for natural gas production 60 to 90 days after it is produced. 

Outlook 

The Sponsor has indicated to the Trustee that development
activity on the Underlying Properties remained elevated through the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, increasing over 150 
from the same period in 2023. Some of this increase reflected prior period capital expenditures associated with 15 new Permian wells that
came online in the current period, for which production and revenues were attributable to prior periods. While commodity prices remain
volatile, the majority of the capital expenditures for the Underlying Properties are associated with large cap, investment grade oil and
gas operators who tend to spend through periods of volatility. Accordingly, although active rig counts within the Permian and Haynesville
regions declined during the first nine months of 2024, recent indications from operators of the Underlying Properties indicate that capital
expenditure activity for the Underlying Properties is expected to be relatively higher than the current industry level activity decline.
These indications remain subject to revision from the operators of the Underlying Properties, but in light of the current expectations
the Sponsor recently established a cash reserve for approved, future development expenses expected in the near-term. 

Although the global economy remains volatile, reflecting,
among other factors, the current hostilities between Israel and Iran amid continued tensions in the Middle East, the ongoing war between
Russia and Ukraine and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Sponsor does not expect that these events will have a material
impact on the Underlying Properties or the expected development activity during the remainder of 2024, due in part to the previously discussed,
investment grade nature of the majority of the operators of the Underlying Properties. The West Texas Intermediate spot price of crude
oil has improved from 71.89 per barrel on December 31, 2023 to 69.58 per barrel on October 31, 2024. Natural gas prices have
declined year-over-year, with the Henry Hub spot price decreasing from 2.58 per MMBtu on December 31, 2023 to 1.82 per MMBtu on
October 31, 2024. 

Given the significant increase in capital expenditures
for the first nine months of 2024, the Sponsor previously revised its 2024 capital spend outlook from the prior range of 5.0 million
to 9.0 million, or 4.0 million to 7.2 million net to the Trust s Net Profits Interest, as detailed in the Trust s 2023
Annual Report on Form 10-K, to 18.0 million to 23.0 million, or 14.4 million to 18.4 million net to the Trust s Net Profits
Interest, as detailed in the Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2024. The Sponsor currently expects capital expenditures
for the year to be at the higher end of that guidance range. The Sponsor expects the remaining anticipated capital expenditures in 2024
to be focused in both the Permian and Haynesville regions. Despite lower natural gas prices, one of the operators of the Underlying Properties
in the Haynesville recently initiated a drilling program that is expected to turn to sales sometime in 2025. Aside from that Haynesville
activity, the remaining natural gas directed expenditures are expected to remain more subdued until a further price recovery. As in prior
periods, the outlook for capital expenditures remains subject to change, as operators are expected to continue to reevaluate their planned
capital expenditures, particularly given volatile capital markets and an uncertain geopolitical situation. 

12 

Over the first nine months of 2024, the Sponsor
continued to see a stabilization of inflationary pressures and operating costs that had been affecting the Underlying Properties in prior
periods on an aggregate basis, as seen in the continued decline in lease operating expenditures per barrel of oil equivalent for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decline also benefited from the increased production from
newer wells that feature lower operating costs than some of the legacy wells on the Underlying Properties. However, some legacy producing
properties of the Underlying Properties continue to experience operating cost and production issues consistent with late-life oil and
gas properties, and currently it is unclear if some of these legacy producing properties will be able to realize a return to prior period
operating costs and cash flow profile . This continued decline in production from legacy properties
was offset by new production and revenue generated as a result of prior period capital expenditures that turned to sales during the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2024. While the markets remain volatile and there remains an inherent delay in cash flows given the non-operated
nature of the Underlying Properties, the Sponsor indicates that it continues to have access to adequate capital and liquidity to fund
such operating and capital expenditures as they come due. 

The Sponsor believes there could be further opportunity
in the coming quarters for potential divestitures and/or leasing of some or all of the Underlying Properties, subject to the Trust s
Net Profits Interest, as certain operators of the Underlying Properties look to acquire assets, particularly in the Permian and Haynesville
regions. 

Capex Drilling Activity Update 

Presented below is a summary of the current status
of certain notable capital projects recently undertaken on the Underlying Properties pursuant to the capital expenditure program described
above. All information has been provided by the Sponsor. 

The following table is not intended to be a comprehensive
list reflecting all capital expenditures to date. In addition, there can often be a several-month delay from the time of capital expenditures
to the time of production and cash flows attributable to the Underlying Properties, especially given the non-operated nature of the Underlying
Properties.

revenues from first production during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The other projects identified above are still in
process or awaiting first revenues, and the Sponsor expects a majority of those projects to be completed and to begin producing by early
2025.

Net profits attributable to the Underlying Properties
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 7.9 million compared to 3.6 million for the three months ended September 30,
2023. The 4.3 million increase in net profits attributable to the Underlying Properties from the 2023 period to the 2024 period
was primarily due to the following items: 

Oil sales increased 3.1 million compared to the 2023 period, reflecting a 2.8 million increase due to higher produced volumes
and a 0.3 million increase due to higher realized prices. Oil sales volumes increased 25 primarily due to the several new Permian wells
that either turned to sales or completed title work during the 2024 period and thereby allowed production attributable to prior periods
to be released by the respective operators. The average oil price received increased 2 as a result of the corresponding increase in the
average NYMEX oil price for the relevant production months. 

Natural gas sales increased 0.5 million compared to the 2023 period, reflecting a 2.4 million increase due to higher produced volumes,
partially offset by a 1.9 million decrease due to lower realized prices. The average natural gas price received decreased 39 primarily
due to the decrease in the average NYMEX natural gas price for the relevant production months. 

Lease operating expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 0.9 million compared to the three months
ended September 30, 2023. 

Compression, gathering and transportation costs increased 0.4 million, primarily due to the new wells that came online during the
three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Production, ad valorem and other taxes increased 0.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the
three months ended September 30, 2023, due to the increase in oil and natural gas produced volumes. 

Development expenses decreased 0.6 million in the 2024 period due to a decline in drilling and completion costs incurred as compared
to the same period in 2023. 

15 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024,
the Trust withheld 0.4 million and paid 0.1 million for general and administrative expenses. Expenses paid during the period primarily
consisted of fees for the preparation of the Trust s monthly press releases, insurance expense, Trustee fees, and New York Stock
Exchange listing fees. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Trust withheld 0.4 million and paid 0.3 million for general
and administrative expenses.

Net profits attributable to the Underlying Properties
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 3.2 million compared to 11.4 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2023. The 8.2 million decrease in net profits attributable to the Underlying Properties from the 2023 period to the 2024 period
was primarily due to the following items: 

Oil sales increased 10.2 million compared to the 2023 period, reflecting a 10.5 million increase in oil sales due to higher produced
volumes, partially offset by a 0.3 million decrease in oil sales due to lower realized prices. Oil sales volumes increased 35 primarily
due to the several new Permian wells that either turned to sales or completed title work during the 2024 period and thereby allowed
production attributable to prior periods to be released by the respective operators. The average oil price received decreased 1 as a
result of the corresponding increase in the average NYMEX oil price for the relevant production months. 

Natural gas sales decreased 2.3 million compared to the 2023 period, reflecting a 5.7 million increase in sales primarily due
to a 59 increase in gas sales volumes, offset by an 8.0 million decrease in sales due to a 52 decline in realized gas prices. 

Lease operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.8 million compared to the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. 

Compression, gathering and transportation costs increased 1.1 million, primarily due to the new wells that came online during the
nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Production, ad valorem and other taxes increased 0.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the
nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to the increase in oil and natural gas produced volumes. 

Development expenses increased 11.2 million in the 2024 period due to drilling and completion costs incurred in connection with the
drilling of multiple new wells in the Permian area. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
the Trust withheld 0.5 million and paid 0.7 million for general and administrative expenses. Expenses paid during the period primarily
consisted of fees for the preparation of the Trust s monthly press releases, insurance expense, Trustee fees, and New York Stock
Exchange listing fees. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Trust withheld 1.2 million and paid 0.8 million for general
and administrative expenses.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Trust s principal sources of liquidity
are cash flow generated from the Net Profits Interest and borrowing capacity under the letter of credit described below. Other than Trust
administrative expenses, including any reserves established by the Trustee for future liabilities, the Trust s only use of cash
is for distributions to Trust unitholders. Available funds are the excess cash, if any, received by the Trust from the Net Profits Interest
and other sources (such as interest earned on any amounts reserved by the Trustee) in any given month, over the Trust s expenses
paid for that month. Available funds are reduced by any cash the Trustee determines to hold as a reserve against future expenses. 

The Trustee may create a cash reserve to pay for
future liabilities of the Trust. In February 2022, the Trustee began withholding 37,833 from the funds otherwise available for distribution
each month to gradually build a cash reserve of approximately 2.3 million for the payment of future known, anticipated or contingent
expenses or liabilities of the Trust. Commencing with the distribution to Trust unitholders payable in April 2023, the Trustee has
been withholding, and in the future intends to withhold, 50,000 from the funds otherwise available for distribution each month to gradually
build the reserve. The Trustee may increase or decrease the targeted cash reserve amount at any time, and may increase or decrease the
rate at which it is withholding funds to build the cash reserve at any time, without advance notice to the Trust unitholders. Cash held
in reserve will be invested as required by the Trust Agreement. Any cash reserved in excess of the amount necessary to pay or provide
for the payment of future known, anticipated or contingent expenses or liabilities eventually will be distributed to Trust unitholders,
together with interest earned on the funds. As of September 30, 2024, the Trustee has withheld 1,091,386 toward this cash reserve. 

If the Trustee determines that the cash on hand
and the cash to be received are, or will be, insufficient to cover the Trust s liabilities, the Trustee may authorize the Trust
to borrow money to pay administrative or incidental expenses of the Trust that exceed cash held by the Trust. The Trustee may authorize
the Trust to borrow from any person, including the Trustee or the Delaware Trustee or an affiliate thereof, although none of the Trustee,
the Delaware Trustee or any affiliate thereof intends to lend funds to the Trust. The Trustee may also cause the Trust to mortgage its
assets to secure payment of the indebtedness. The terms of such indebtedness and security interest, if funds were to be loaned by the
entity serving as Trustee or Delaware Trustee or an affiliate thereof, would be similar to the terms which such entity would grant to
a similarly situated commercial customer with whom it did not have a fiduciary relationship. In addition, COERT has provided the Trust
with a 1.2 million letter of credit to be used by the Trust if its cash on hand (including available cash reserves) is insufficient to
pay ordinary course administrative expenses. Further, if the Trust requires more than the 1.2 million under the letter of credit to pay
administrative expenses, COERT has agreed to loan funds to the Trust necessary to pay such expenses. Any loan made by COERT to the Trust
would be evidenced by a written promissory note, be on an unsecured basis, and have terms that are no less favorable to COERT than those
that would be obtained in an arm s length transaction between COERT and an unaffiliated third party. If the Trust borrows funds
or draws on the letter of credit, no further distributions will be made to Trust unitholders until such amounts borrowed or drawn are
repaid. Except for the foregoing, the Trust has no source of liquidity or capital resources. The Trustee has no current plans to authorize
the Trust to borrow any funds. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, including the aggregate amounts withheld as of
such dates toward the approximately 2.3 million cash reserve discussed above, the Trust had cash of 1,808,446 and 1,394,697, respectively,
to be used towards future Trust expenses. Since its formation, the Trust has not borrowed any funds and no amounts have been drawn on
the letter of credit. 

From
time to time, if the Trust s cash on hand (including available cash reserves, if any) is not sufficient to pay the Trust s
ordinary course administrative expenses that are due prior to the monthly payment to the Trust of proceeds from the Net Profits Interest,
COERT may advance funds to the Trust to pay such expenses. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no
outstanding advances. Any advances to the Trust will be carried forward to be repaid out of future net profits generated by the Underlying
Properties. 

Cash held by the Trustee as a reserve against future
liabilities or for distribution at the next distribution date may be held in a noninterest-bearing account or may be invested in: 

interest-bearing obligations of the United States government; 

18 

money market funds that invest only in United States government securities; 

repurchase agreements secured by interest-bearing obligations of the United States government; or 

bank certificates of deposit. 

The Trust pays the Trustee an annual administrative
fee of 200,000 and the Delaware Trustee an annual fee of 2,000. The Trust also incurs, either directly or as a reimbursement to the
Trustee, legal, accounting, tax and engineering fees, printing costs and other expenses that are deducted by the Trust before distributions
are made to Trust unitholders. The Trust also is responsible for paying other expenses incurred as a result of being a publicly traded
entity, including costs associated with annual and quarterly reports to Trust unitholders, tax return and Form 1099 preparation and
distribution, NYSE listing fees, independent auditor fees and registrar and transfer agent fees. 

The Trust does not have any transactions, arrangements
or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or persons that could materially affect the Trust s liquidity or the availability
of capital resources. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The Trust has no off-balance sheet arrangements.
The Trust has not guaranteed the debt of any other party, nor does the Trust have any other arrangements or relationships with other entities
that could potentially result in unconsolidated debt, losses or contingent obligations.

defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, the Trust is not required to provide information required by this Item. 

Item 4. 
 Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Trustee conducted an evaluation of the Trust s
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
 Exchange Act )). Based on this evaluation, the Trustee has concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of the Trust
were effective, as of the end of the period covered by this report, in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Trust
in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Trustee to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

Due to the nature of the Trust as a passive entity
and in light of the contractual arrangements pursuant to which the Trust was created, including the provisions of (i) the Trust Agreement
and (ii) the Conveyance, the Trustee s disclosure controls and procedures related to the Trust necessarily rely on (A) information
provided by the Sponsor, including information relating to results of operations, the costs and revenues attributable to the Trust s
interest under the Conveyance and other operating and historical data, plans for future operating and capital expenditures, reserve information,
information relating to projected production, and other information relating to the status and results of operations of the Underlying
Properties and the Net Profits Interest, and (B) conclusions and reports regarding reserves by the Trust s independent reserve
engineers.

the quarter ended September 30, 2024 , there were no changes in the Trust s internal control over financial reporting

The Trustee notes for purposes of clarification that it has no authority over, and makes no statement concerning, the internal control
over financial reporting of the Sponsor.
