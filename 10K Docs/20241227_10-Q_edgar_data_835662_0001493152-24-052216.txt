 NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 (UNAUDITED) 

of the Company s
outstanding shares from China Concentric Capital Group for , pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated December 21, 2016,
which resulted in a change in control of the Company. 

On
December 12, 2017, pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement, in consideration for all of the outstanding shares of AiXin (BVI) International
Group Co., Ltd. a British Virgin Islands corporation AiXin BVI ), the Company issued to Mr. Lin, the sole stockholder of
AiXin BVI, shares of common stock then representing of the outstanding of common stock of the Company. 

As
a result of the Share Exchange, AiXin BVI became the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, and the Company owns all of the outstanding
shares of HK AiXin International Group Co., Limited, a Hong Kong limited company AiXin HK ), which in turn owns all of
the outstanding shares of Chengdu AiXinZhonghong Biological Technology Co., Ltd., a Chinese limited company AiXinZhonghong ),
which markets and sells premium-quality nutritional products in China. 

AiXin
BVI was incorporated on September 21, 2017 as a holding company and AiXin HK was established in Hong Kong on February 25, 2016 as an
intermediate holding company. AiXinZhonghong was established in the People s Republic of China PRC on March 4,
2013, and on May 27, 2017, the local government of the PRC issued a certificate of approval regarding the foreign ownership of AiXinZhonghong
by AiXin HK. Neither AiXin BVI nor AiXin HK had operations prior to December 12, 2017. 

For
accounting purposes, the acquisition of AiXin BVI was accounted for as a reverse acquisition and treated as a recapitalization of the
Company effected by a share exchange, with AiXin BVI as the accounting acquirer. Since neither AiXin BVI nor AiXin HK had operations
prior to December 12, 2017, the historical consolidated financial statements of AiXinZhonghong are now the historical consolidated financial
statements of the Company. The assets and liabilities of AiXinZhonghong were brought forward at their book value and no goodwill was
recognized. 

Effective
February 1, 2018, the Company changed its name to AiXin Life International, Inc. Aixin Life ). 

The
Company, through its indirectly owned subsidiary, AiXinZhonghong, develops and distributes consumer products by offering a line of nutritional
products. The Company sells the products through exhibition events, conferences, and person-to-person marketing. The Company s
business mainly focuses on a proactive approach to its customers such as hosting events for clients, which it believes is ideally suited
to marketing its products because sales of nutrition products are strengthened by ongoing personal contact and support, coaching and
education of its clients, as to the benefits of a healthy and active lifestyle. 

On
May 25, 2021, AiXin HK entered into an Equity Transfer Agreement (the Hotel Purchase Agreement with Chengdu Aixin Shangyan
Hotel Management Co., Ltd Aixin Shangyan Hotel ), and its two shareholders Quanzhong Lin and Yirong Shen Transferor ).
Pursuant to the Hotel Purchase Agreement, Aixin Life purchased ownership of Aixin Shangyan Hotel from Transferor. Eighty percent
of the equity of Aixin Shangyan Hotel was owned by Mr. Lin, and the remaining balance was owned by Ms. Shen. Under the terms of the Hotel
Purchase Agreement, Aixin Life purchased all of the outstanding equity of Aixin Shangyan Hotel for a purchase price of RMB ,
or approximately million (the Transfer Price ). The Transfer Price was to be reduced by an amount equal to any amounts
paid or distributed by Aixin Shangyan Hotel to the Transferor after December 31, 2020 and increased by an amount equal to any amounts
contributed to Aixin Shangyan Hotel by the Transferor after December 31, 2020. The acquisition was completed in July 2021. 

Pursuant to the Pharmacies
Purchase Agreement, AiXin HK purchased all of the outstanding equity of Aixintang Pharmacies for an aggregate purchase price of RMB ,
or approximately US million (the Transfer Price ). The Transfer Price was to be reduced by an amount equal to any amounts
paid or distributed by any of the Aixintang Pharmacies to the Transferor after December 31, 2020 and increased by an amount contributed
to any of the Aixintang Pharmacies by the Transferor after such date. The acquisition was completed in September 2021. 

Pursuant to the Transfer Agreement, AiXin HK agreed to purchase all of the outstanding equity of Runcangsheng for an aggregate
purchase price of (RMB ), adjusted by the amount equal to the initial net worth minus the audited net worth.
In addition to transferring their respective equity interest in Runcangsheng, both Sellers agree to forgive any loans Runcangsheng due
to them. The acquisition was completed on September 30, 2022. 

On
February 17, 2023, the Company effected a . As a result of the reverse split, every two shares of the Company s
issued and outstanding common stock will be automatically combined and converted into one issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value 
per share. The Company has approximately shares of outstanding common stock after the effect of reverse stock split and the
elimination of fractional shares. All share and earnings per share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse
stock split. 

The
Company suffered net losses of and
 for
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and and
 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and net cash outflow in operating activities of and
 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and has an accumulated deficit of as
of September 30, 2024. These facts and conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. From January 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024, the Company s cash and cash equivalents increased from to
 mainly
due to an increase in cash inflow from financing activities. 

Management
believes that it has developed a liquidity plan, summarized below, that, if executed successfully, should provide sufficient liquidity
to meet the Company s obligations as they become due for a reasonable period of time, and allow the development of its core business.
The plan includes: 

Gaining positive cash-inflow from operating activities through continuous cost reductions and the sales of higher margin products. 

Raising cash through loans from related parties and potential equity offerings. 

While
the Company s management believes that the measures in its liquidity plan including those described above will be adequate to satisfy
its liquidity requirements for the twelve months after the date that these financial statements are issued, there is no assurance that
the liquidity plan will be successfully implemented. Failure to successfully implement the liquidity plan may have a material adverse
effect on the Company s business, results of operations and financial position, and may adversely affect its ability to continue
as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification
of recorded assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities or any other adjustments that might be necessary should the Company
be unable to continue as a going concern.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . 

The
following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited financial
statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and with the audited financial statements and the notes
thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Form 10-K ). This discussion
contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should specifically consider the various risk factors identified
in our 2023 Form 10-K, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. 

Overview 

In
December 2017, we completed a reverse acquisition whereby we acquired all of the outstanding shares of AiXin (BVI)
International Group Co., Ltd. a British Virgin Islands corporation AiXin BVI ). As a result, AiXin BVI became our
wholly-owned subsidiary, and through AiXin BVI we now own all of the outstanding shares of HK AiXin International Group Co.,
Limited, a Hong Kong limited company AiXin HK ), which in turn owns all of the outstanding shares of Chengdu
AiXinZhongHong Biological Technology Co., Ltd., a Chinese limited company AiXinZhongHong ), which began distributing
nutritional products in 2013. 

In
September 2021, we completed the acquisition of nine pharmacies located in Chengdu by acquiring the entities which owned the pharmacies
for an aggregate purchase price of RMB 34,635,845, or approximately US 5.31 million. We
currently operate pharmacies at 26 locations, including 18 locations operated pursuant to a single chain license. 

Pursuant
to an Equity Transfer Agreement (the Transfer Agreement ), on September 30, 2022, we acquired all of the outstanding equity
of Yunnan Runcangsheng Technology Co., Ltd Runcangsheng for RMB 31,557,820 (approximately USD 4.4 million), reduced by
 116,802 the excess of the estimated net worth of Runcangsheng over its audited net worth as of December 31, 2021. In addition to transferring
their respective equity interest in Runcangsheng, both Sellers agreed to forgive any loans due to them from Runcangsheng. Runcangsheng
was established in April 2020, and is headquartered in Luquan Yi and Miao Autonomous County, Kunming City, Yunnan Province. 

Runcangsheng
operates a 13,000 square meter production facility, which houses R D centers, extraction facilities, preparation workshops and a
warehouse. Runcangsheng has more than 30 sub brands and is focused on promoting a healthy lifestyle through the use of foods believed
to promote well-being, health foods, modernized versions of traditional Chinese medical products and plant extracts. Runcangsheng cultivates
many of the raw materials used in its products, compounds the materials into easy to transport and use pre-packaged foods and distributes
the products at the wholesale level. As life-styles in China evolve, work pressures increase and the ingestion of meats and other western
style foods increases, Runcangsheng seeks to design and market products intended to combat the increase in obesity, hypertension, insomnia
and physical ailments associated with such changes. The acquisition of Runcangsheng will enable us to operate as a vertically integrated
company, capable of formulating the kinds of health foods and other nutritional products and supplements suitable for our clients and
marketing those products through our distribution channels. 

In
addition to our acquisitions in the health and nutritional sector, in July 2021, we completed the acquisition of Aixin Shangyan Hotel
through which we owned and operated a hotel located in the Jinniu District, Chengdu City. Effective March 31, 2024, we terminated our
lease for the Shangyan Hotel. In the termination agreement we and the landlord agreed to release each other from any claims and the landlord
agreed to return the security deposit. 

On
February 6, 2024, we entered into a lease with respect to a hotel located in Bandzhuyuan Town, Xindu District, Chengdu City. The term
of the lease commenced February 29, 2024 and expires April 15, 2034. The Lease grants us the right to occupy various areas within the
hotel, covering approximately 18,000 square meters, including the first-floor lobby, external shops (subject to the rights of the current
occupants), the second and third floors, portions of the fourth floor including the restaurant and tea shop, and the fifth through eighteenth
floors comprised mainly of guest rooms, underground and ground parking lots, and all hotel facilities and equipment. References to hotel
revenues and operating costs below are with respect to the hotel we previously occupied in the Jinniu District of Chengdu.

We
intend to look for additional opportunities to profit from the growing healthcare market in China. Though currently we are not party
to any agreements, we will explore, among other opportunities, expanding our product line through internal research and acquiring complementary
products from third parties, acquiring additional pharmacies and other retail outlets and operating nursing homes and possibly clinics
which provide medical care to clients. 

Our
Business 

We
are focused on providing health and wellness products to the growing middle class in China. We currently develop, manufacture, market
and sell premium-quality healthcare, nutritional products and wellness supplements, including herbs and greens, traditional Chinese remedies,
functional products, such as weight management tools, probiotics, foods and drinks. We offer products manufactured by us and those purchased
from third parties through a diversified, omni-channel business model which generates revenues through retail and wholesale product sales,
through company-owned pharmacies, direct marketing and e-commerce. Our marketing approach emphasizes proactively approaching customers
such as by hosting marketing events for clients, which we believe is ideally suited to marketing the products we offer because sales
of healthcare, nutritional products and supplements are strengthened by ongoing personal contact and support, coaching and education
among the Company and our clients towards how to achieve a healthy and active lifestyle. 

We
believe the competitive strengths that will enable us to grow in the health and wellness market include our ability to design and manufacture
products that are responsive to consumers needs as the life style of China s middle class evolves, our coordinated omni-channel
distribution network where we enable consumers to obtain the information they need to improve their lifestyle on our website, at our
pharmacies and through individual meetings with our team members. 

Our
ability to operate profitably and generate positive cash flow will be determined by our ability to attract a large and loyal customer
base and provide the information and products they need cost effectively. Our revenue will largely be determined by our ability to achieve
and maintain a strong brand name and company image, the volume of products we sell and the prices we can charge for such products, which
will require that we compete effectively. Our costs will largely be determined by the cost of raw materials and acquired inventory, the
labor used to design and manufacture products, and the costs incurred to deliver these products to the consumer. 

We
intend to build a reputation as a provider of premium health and wellness products that seeks to improve our customers health and well-being.
Our objective is to offer a broad and deep mix of products for consumers interested in living well, whether they are looking to treat
a health-related issue or simply maintain their overall wellness. Our premium, value-added offerings include both proprietary products
developed and manufactured by us as well as products acquired from or sold on behalf of third parties. We believe our range of products
and ability to develop new products, combined with the customer support and service we offer, differentiate us and allow us to effectively
compete against food, drug and mass channel players, specialty stores, independent vitamin, supplement and natural food shops and online
retailers. There is no assurance that we will achieve our business objectives.

Revenue 

Revenue
was 936,406 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1,066,919 in the same period of 2023, a decrease of 130,513
or 12 . The decrease in revenue was mainly due to decreases in direct sales of our nutritional products, pharmacy sales, and a decrease
in revenues from manufacture and sale segment which we refer to as Runcangsheng , which was partly offset by an increase
in revenue from our hotel sector. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had 745,545 in product revenues (of which,
 102,370 were from direct sales, 266,664 were from sales at our pharmacies, and 376,511 from Runcangsheng) and hotel revenue of 190,861.
For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had 897,457 in product revenues (of which, 208,699 were from direct sales, 273,416
were from sales at our pharmacies, and 415,342 from sales by Runcangsheng) and hotel revenue of 169,462.

Direct
Sales 

Our
direct sales revenue was 102,370 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 208,699 in the same period of 2023, representing
a decrease of 106,329 or 51 . Our direct sales revenue as a percentage of our total revenue was 11 for the three months ended September
30, 2024, compared to 20 for the same period of 2023. The decrease in revenue was mainly due to the overall economic downturn in China
as marketing and promotion became more challenging compared to last year. Additionally, due to reduced quantities of certain popular
products available from our suppliers resulting from increased raw material costs, we had to adjust our product mix. 

Pharmacy 

Our
pharmacy revenue was 266,664 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 273,416 in the same period of 2023, representing
a decrease of 6,752 or 2 . Our pharmacy revenue as a percentage of our total revenue was 28 for the three months ended September 30,
2024, compared to 26 for the same period of 2023. The decrease in revenue was mainly due to the overall economic downturn in China and
the inability of marketing and promotional activities for supplements and other health products to generate revenue comparable to those
of prior years. 

Hotel 

Our
hotel revenue was 190,861 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 169,462 for the same period of 2023,
representing an increase of 21,399 or 13 . Our hotel revenue as a percentage of our total revenue was 20 for the three months
ended September 30, 2024, compared to 16 for the same period of 2023. The increase in revenue was primarily due to the decrease of the hotel room rates for attracting
more customers. 

Runcangsheng 

Sales
revenues generated from manufacture and sales by Runucangsheng were 376,511 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared
with 415,342 for the same period of 2023, representing a decrease of 38,831 or 9 . Runcangsheng s revenue as a percentage of
our total revenue was 40 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 39 for the same period of 2023. The decrease in
revenue was mainly due to the overall economic downturn in China as marketing and promotion became more challenging compared to last
year. 

Operating
Costs and Expenses 

Cost
of Goods Sold 

Cost
of goods sold was 355,740 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 509,723 for the same period of 2023, a decrease
of 153,983 or 30 . The decrease in cost of goods sold was attributable to the decrease in Runcangsheng s business, decreased direct
sales and decrease in pharmacy revenues. 

Direct
sales 

The
cost of goods sold for our direct sales was 499 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 67,709 for the same
period of 2023, representing a decrease of 67,210 or 99 . The cost of goods sold for our direct sales as a percentage of direct sales
revenue was 0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 32 for the same period of 2023. The decrease in cost of goods
sold was primarily driven by decreased sales and the elimination in 2024 of a commission program for our sales personnel. 

31 

Pharmacy 

The
cost of goods sold at our pharmacies was 70,739 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 126,459 for the same period
of 2023, representing a decrease of 55,720 or 44 . The cost of goods sold at our pharmacies as a percentage of pharmacy product sales
was 27 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 46 for the same period of 2023. The decrease in cost of goods sold
was mainly due to our coordination of activities at our pharmacies, such as the implementation of bulk inventory purchasing which reduced
our purchasing costs; and cost reduction measures undertaken in September 2023, including reviewing our list of vendors and replacing
those vendors with higher cost products.

Revenue 

Revenue
was 3,120,615 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3,297,689 in the same period of 2023, a decrease of 177,074
or 5 . The decrease in revenue was mainly due to decreases in direct sales of our nutritional products and pharmacy sales, and a decrease
in our hotel segment, which was partly offset by an increase in revenues from Runcangsheng. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
we had 2,655,192 in product revenues (of which 625,132 were from direct sales, 764,495 were from sales at our pharmacies and 1,265,565
from sales by Runcangsheng) and hotel revenue of 465,423. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had 2,405,280 in product
revenues (of which 1,064,668 were from direct sales, 802,118 were from sales at our pharmacies and 538,494 from sales by Runcangsheng)
and hotel revenue of 892,409. 

Direct
Sales 

Our
direct sales revenue was 625,132 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 1,064,668 in the same period of 2023,
representing a decrease of 439,536 or 41 . Our direct sales revenue as a percentage of our total revenue was 20 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, compared to 32 for the same period of 2023. The decrease in revenue was mainly due to the economic downturn
as marketing and promotional activities become more challenging compared to last year. Additionally, due to reduced supplies of certain
popular products, we had to adjust our product mix in 2024. 

Pharmacy 

Our
pharmacy revenue was 764,495 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 802,118 in the same period of 2023, representing
a decrease of 37,623 or 5 . Our pharmacy revenue as a percentage of our total revenue was 24 for the nine months ended September 30,
2024, compared to 24 for the same period of 2023. The decrease in revenue was mainly due to the economic downturn as marketing and promotional
activities did not generate anticipated revenues. 

Hotel 

Our
hotel revenue was 465,423 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 892,409 for the same period of 2023, representing
a decrease of 426,986 or 48 . Our hotel revenue as a percentage of our total revenue was 15 for the nine months ended September 30,
2024, compared to 27 for the same period of 2023. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to the Company relocating its hotel and
the need to complete leasehold improvements before opening at our new location. 

Runcangsheng 

Our
manufacture and sales revenues at Runcangsheng were 1,265,565 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 538,494 for
the same period of 2023, representing an increase of 727,071 or 135 . Runcangsheng s revenue as a percentage of our total revenue
was 41 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 16 for the same period of 2023. The increase in Runcangsheng s
sales was mainly driven by participation in more shows, which raised our visibility and consequently boosted sales; and attendance by
more vendors, corporate and individual major customers to our internal shows, which expanded our sales channels, and the addition of
new salespeople and increased consumer demand for Chinese herbal products during the Chinese New Year. 

Operating
Costs and Expenses 

Cost
of Goods Sold 

Cost
of goods sold was 1,163,640 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1,136,411 for the same period of 2023, an increase
of 27,229 or 2 . The increase in cost of goods sold was attributable to the increase in Runcangsheng s business which was partly
offset by decreased sales from our direct sales and pharmacy segments.

8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 34 for the same period of 2023. The decrease in cost of goods sold was
primarily driven by the decrease of sales and the elimination in 2024 of a commission program for our sales personnel.

was 29 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 56 for the same period of 2023. The decrease in cost of goods sold
was mainly due to our coordination of activities at our pharmacies, such as the implementation of bulk inventory purchasing which reduced
our purchasing costs; and cost reduction measures undertaken in September 2023, including reviewing our list of vendors and replacing
those vendors with higher cost products. 

Runcangsheng 

The
cost of goods sold for Runcangsheng was 893,568 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 322,207 for the same period

sold was the significant increase of sales.

segments, which was partly offset by decreased operating expenses at our pharmacy and direct sales segments. 

Loss
from Operations 

Loss from operations was 1,492,654 in the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1,391,993 in the same period of 2023, an increase of 100,661 or 7 . The increase in our loss from
operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the increase in the loss in our hotel segment of approximately
 340,795, partially offset by decreased loss in Runcangsheng, direct sales and pharmacy segments. 

Non-operating
Income 

Non-operating
income was 166,612 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 332,386 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

2024 was 1,326,569, compared to a net loss of 1,065,486 for the same period of 2023, an increase of 261,083 or 25 . The increase in
our net loss was mainly due to decreased sales and decreased other income, and our hotel where the operating loss increased by nearly
 340,795 due to the Company relocating its hotel to a new location and additional costs and expenses incurred for hotel improvement and
renovation before opening to the public.

Net

by financing activities were the result of capital contributions of 142,200 and proceeds from government grant of 284,321, partly
offset by payments made against advances from related parties of 79,072. 

We
generated a 1,326,569 loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. It is likely that Runcangsheng will require additional capital
to achieve its short-term operational goals and long-range business plans. Further, we may need additional capital to maintain our other
businesses. We may also have to raise additional financing as our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with
the growth of our business. In the past we have funded our operations through proceeds from private placements of equity and advances
from our principal shareholder. Should we require capital to fund our business, we intend to finance our business by raising additional
capital or, when available, borrowing additional funds. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in
dilution to our current shareholders and could cause the price of our common stock to decrease. Further, such securities might have rights,
preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If
adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business
endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. 

We
are subject to all of the substantial risks inherent in the development of a new business enterprise within an extremely competitive
industry. Due to the absence of a long-standing operating history and the emerging nature of the markets in which we compete, we anticipate
operating losses until we can successfully implement our business strategy. Our revenue model is new and evolving, and we cannot be certain
that it will be successful. The potential profitability of our business model is unproven. We may never achieve profitable operations.
Our future operating results depend on many factors, including demand for our products, the level of competition, and the ability of
our officers to manage our business and growth. As a result of the emerging nature of the market in which we compete, we may incur operating
losses until such time as we can develop a substantial and stable revenue base. Additional development expenses may delay or negatively
impact our ability to generate profits. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that our business model will be successful or that we can sustain
revenue growth, achieve or sustain profitability, or continue as a going concern. 

Our
ability to obtain funds through the issuance of debt or equity is dependent upon the state of the financial markets at such time as we
may seek to raise funds. The state of the capital market markets may be adversely impacted by various risks and uncertainties, including,
but not limited to future and current impacts of global events such as COVID-19, the war in the Ukraine and the conflict in Palestine,
increases in inflation and other risks detailed herein. 

Impact
of Inflation 

Our
results of operations may be affected by inflation, particularly rising prices for products and other operating costs if we cannot pass
such increases along to our customers in the form of higher prices for our products and services. Generally, we are not party to long
term contracts and our inventory turns multiple times per year and we anticipate that we will be able to increase prices on products
to reflect increases in the cost of inventory. 

Contractual
Obligations 

We
have no long-term fixed contractual obligations or commitments other than leases that are disclosed in Note 12 in the notes to our consolidated
financial statements. 

37 

Contingencies 

Our
operations are conducted in the PRC and are subject to specific considerations and significant risks not typically associated with companies
in North America and Western Europe. These include risks associated with, among others, the political, economic and legal environments
in China and foreign currency exchange rates. Our results may be adversely affected by changes in PRC government policies with respect
to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary measures, currency conversion and remittance abroad and rates and methods of taxation, among
other things. 

Our
sales, purchases and expense transactions in China are denominated in RMB and all of our assets and liabilities in China are also denominated
in RMB. The RMB is not freely convertible into foreign currencies under the current PRC law. In China, foreign exchange transactions
are required by law to be transacted only by authorized financial institutions. Remittances in currencies other than RMB may require
certain supporting documentation in order to affect the remittance. 

Significant
Accounting Policies 

Our
management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial
statements, which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America US
GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as
the reported net sales and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. We
base our estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

While
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, we believe the following
accounting policies are the most critical to assist you in fully understanding and evaluating this management discussion and analysis. 

Basis
of Presentation 

The
accompanying financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles US GAAP ).
The functional currency of AiXinZhongHong, Aixin Shangyan Hotel, Aixintang Pharmacies, and Runcangsheng is the Chinese Renminbi RMB ).
The accompanying financial statements are translated from RMB and presented in U.S. dollars USD ). 

Use
of Estimates 

In
preparing financial statements in conformity with US GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, as well as the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 

Significant
estimates, required by management, include the recoverability of long-lived assets, allowance for doubtful accounts, and the reserve
for obsolete and slow-moving inventories. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Accounts
Receivable 

We
maintain an allowance for potential credit losses on accounts receivable. Management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and
analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment
patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the bad debt allowance was 89,935
and 80,640, respectively. 

38 

Revenue
Recognition 

Revenue
from sale of goods under Topic 606 is recognized in a manner that reasonably reflects the delivery of our products and services
to customers in return for expected consideration and includes the following elements: 

executed
 contract(s) with customers that we believe are legally enforceable; 

identification
 of performance obligation in the respective contract; 

determination
 of the transaction price for each performance obligation in the respective contract; 

allocation
 of the transaction price to each performance obligation; and 

recognition
 of revenue only when we satisfy each performance obligation. 

Our
revenue recognition policies for our operating segments are as follows: 

Direct
Sales 

Our
revenue from direct sales of products is recognized when goods are delivered to the customer and no other obligation exists. We do not
provide unconditional return or other concessions to customers. Our sales policy allows for the return of unopened products for cash
after deducting certain service and transaction fees. As an alternative to returning a product, customers may request an exchange for
products with the same value. 

Direct
sales revenue represents the invoiced value of goods, net of value-added taxes VAT ). All of our products sold in China
are subject to the PRC VAT of 13 of the gross sales price since April 1, 2019. This VAT may be offset by VAT paid by for raw materials
and other materials purchased in China. We record VAT payables and VAT receivables net of payments in the financial statements. The VAT
tax return is filed offsetting the payables against the receivables. Sales and purchases are recorded net of VAT collected and paid as
we act as an agent for the government. 

Pharmacy 

Our
retail drugstores recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise. For pharmacy sales, each prescription
claim is its own arrangement with the customer and is a performance obligation. We generally receive payment from pharmacy customers we satisfy our performance obligations. We record a receivable when we have an unconditional right to receive payment and only the
passage of time is required before payment is due. Sales revenue represents the invoiced value of goods, net of VAT. The products sold
in our pharmacies are subject to the VAT of 0 -13 as certain pharmacies qualify for small business exemption. 

Runcangsheng 

The
Company s subsidiary Runcangsheng recognizes revenue at the time products are shipped as this satisfies its performance
obligation. The Company records a receivable for the sales when it has an unconditional right to receive payment and only the
passage of time is required before payment is due. Sales revenue represents the invoiced value of goods, net of VAT. All of the
Company s products sold in China are subject to the PRC VAT of 13 unless it is a qualified small business subject to
exemption. 

Hotel 

Hotel
revenues are primarily derived from the rental of rooms, food and beverage sales and other ancillary goods and services, including but
not limited to souvenir, parking and conference reservations. Each of these products and services represents a distinct performance
obligation and, in exchange for these services, we receive fixed amounts based on published rates or negotiated contracts. Payment is
due in full at the time when the services are rendered or the goods are provided. Room rental revenue is recognized on a daily basis
when rooms are occupied. Food and beverage revenue and other goods and services revenue are recognized when they have been delivered
or rendered to the guests as the respective performance obligations are satisfied. All of the hotel s goods sold in China are subject
to the PRC VAT of 6 . This VAT may be offset by VAT paid by on raw materials and other materials purchased in China.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Management
of AiXin Life International, Inc. is responsible for maintaining disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s
rules and forms. In addition, the disclosure controls and procedures must ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required financial and other required disclosures. 

An
evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) of the Exchange
Act as of September 30, 2024, was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our
Chief Financial Officer. Based on their evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, they concluded that at September 30, 2024,
such disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. This was due to our limited resources, including the absence of a financial
staff with accounting and financial expertise and deficiencies in the design or operation of our internal control over financial reporting
that adversely affected our disclosure controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses. 

We
plan to designate individuals responsible for identifying reportable developments and to implement procedures designed to remediate the
material weakness by focusing additional attention and resources in our internal accounting functions. However, the material weakness
will not be considered remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded,
through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
under the Exchange Act, during our most recently completed fiscal quarter which is the subject of this report that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
