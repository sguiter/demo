EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 This report combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024, of Kimco Realty Corporation (the Company and Kimco Realty OP, LLC Kimco OP ). Prior to January 1, 2023, the Company s business was conducted through a predecessor entity also known as Kimco Realty Corporation (the Predecessor ). On December 14, 2022, the Predecessor s Board of Directors approved the entry into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the UPREIT Merger with the company formerly known as New KRC Corp., which was a Maryland corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Predecessor (the Parent Company ), and KRC Merger Sub Corp., which was a Maryland corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent Company Merger Sub ), to effect the reorganization (the Reorganization of the Predecessor s business into an umbrella partnership real estate investment trust, or UPREIT . 
 On January 1, 2023, pursuant to the UPREIT Merger, Merger Sub merged with and into the Predecessor, with the Predecessor continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent Company, and each outstanding share of capital stock of the Predecessor was converted into one equivalent share of capital stock of the Parent Company (each share of which has continued to trade under their respective existing ticker symbol with the same rights, powers and limitations that existed immediately prior to the Reorganization). 
 In connection with the Reorganization, the Parent Company changed its name to Kimco Realty Corporation, and replaced the Predecessor as the New York Stock Exchange-listed public company. Effective as of January 3, 2023, the Predecessor converted into a limited liability company, organized in the State of Delaware, known as Kimco Realty OP, LLC, the entity we refer to herein as Kimco OP . 
 Following the Reorganization, substantially all of the Company s assets are held by, and substantially all of the Company s operations are conducted through, Kimco OP (either directly or through its subsidiaries), as the Company s operating company, and the Company is the managing member of Kimco OP. The officers and directors of the Company are the same as the officers and directors of the Predecessor immediately prior to the Reorganization. 
 The Parent Company is a real estate investment trust ("REIT") and is the managing member of Kimco OP. As of September 30, 2024, the Parent Company owned 99.84 of the outstanding limited liability company interests (the "OP Units") in Kimco OP. 
 Stockholders' equity and members capital are the primary areas of difference between the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of the Parent Company and those of Kimco OP. Kimco OP s capital currently includes OP Units owned by the Parent and non-controlling OP Units owned by third parties. OP Units owned by third parties are accounted for within capital on Kimco OP s financial statements and in non-controlling interests in the Parent Company s financial statements. 
 The Parent Company consolidates Kimco OP for financial reporting purposes, and the Parent Company does not have significant assets other than its investment in Kimco OP. Therefore, while stockholders equity, members capital and noncontrolling interests differ as discussed above, the assets and liabilities of the Parent Company and Kimco OP are the same on their respective financial statements. 
 The Company believes combining the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of the Parent Company and Kimco OP into this single report provides the following benefits: 
 Enhances investors' understanding of the Parent Company and Kimco OP by enabling investors to view the businesses as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business; 

Eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more concise and readable presentation, because a substantial portion of the disclosure applies to both the Parent Company and Kimco OP; and 

Creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports. 

In order to highlight the differences between the Parent Company and Kimco OP, there are sections in this Quarterly Report that separately discuss the Parent Company and Kimco OP, including separate financial statements (but combined footnotes), separate controls and procedures sections, and separate Exhibit 31 and 32 certifications. In the sections that combine disclosure for the Parent Company and Kimco OP, unless context otherwise requires, this Quarterly Report refers to actions or holdings of the Parent Company and/or Kimco OP as being the actions or holdings of the Company (either directly or through its subsidiaries, including Kimco OP). 
 Throughout this Quarterly Report, unless the context requires otherwise: 
 The Company, we, our or us refer to: 

o the Parent Company and its business and operations conducted through its directly or indirectly owned subsidiaries, including Kimco OP; and 

o in statements regarding qualification as a REIT, such terms refer solely to the Predecessor or Parent Company, as applicable. 

Kimco OP refers to Kimco Realty OP, LLC, our operating company following the UPREIT Merger. 

References to shares and shareholders refer to the shares and shareholders of the Parent Company and not the limited liability company interests of Kimco OP.

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES AND KIMCO REALTY OP, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 o f the outstanding limited liability company interests (the "OP Units") in Kimco OP. The terms Kimco , the Company and our each refer to the Parent Company and Kimco OP, collectively, unless the context indicates otherwise. In statements regarding qualification as a REIT, such terms refer solely to Kimco Realty Corporation. The Company is North America s largest publicly traded owner and operator of open-air, grocery-anchored shopping centers and a growing portfolio of mixed-use assets. The Company s portfolio is primarily concentrated in the first-ring suburbs of the top major metropolitan markets, including those in high-barrier-to-entry coastal markets and rapidly expanding Sun Belt cities, with a tenant mix focused on essential, necessity-based goods and services that drive multiple shopping trips per week. The Company, its affiliates and related real estate joint ventures are engaged principally in the ownership, management, development and operation of open-air shopping centers, including mixed-use assets, which are anchored primarily by grocery stores, off-price retailers, discounters or service-oriented tenants. Additionally, the Company provides complementary services that capitalize on the Company s established retail real estate expertise. The Company s mission is to create destinations for everyday living that inspire a sense of community and deliver value to our many stakeholders. The Company evaluates performance on a property specific or transactional basis and does not distinguish its principal business or group its operations on a geographical basis for purposes of measuring performance. Accordingly, the Company believes it has a single reportable segment for disclosure purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). The Company elected status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with its taxable year which began January 1, 1992 and operates in a manner that enables the Company to maintain its status as a REIT. To qualify as a REIT, the Company must meet several organizational and operational requirements, and is required to annually distribute at least 90 of its net taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain. In addition, the Company will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it distributes less than 100 of its net taxable income, including any net capital gains. In January 2023, the Company consummated the Reorganization into an UPREIT structure as described in the Explanatory Note at the beginning of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. If, as the Company believes, it is organized and operates in such a manner so as to qualify and remain qualified as a REIT under the Code, the Company, generally, will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax, provided that distributions to its stockholders equal at least the amount of its REIT taxable income, as defined in the Code. The Company maintains certain subsidiaries that have made joint elections with the Company to be treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries TRSs ), that permit the Company to engage through such TRSs in certain business activities that the REIT may not conduct directly. A TRS is subject to federal and state income taxes on its income, and the Company includes, when applicable, a provision for taxes in its condensed consolidated financial statements. RPT Merger On August 28, 2023, the Company and RPT Realty RPT announced that they had entered into a definitive merger agreement (the Merger Agreement pursuant to which the Company would acquire RPT through a series of mergers (collectively, the RPT Merger ). On January 2, 2024, RPT merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving public company. The RPT Merger added open-air shopping centers, of which were wholly owned and of which are owned through a joint venture, comprising million square feet of gross leasable area GLA ). In addition, as a result of the RPT Merger, the Company obtained RPT s stake in a -property net lease joint venture. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each RPT common share was converted into of a newly issued share of the Company s common stock, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares, and each Series D Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Share of RPT was converted into the right to receive one depositary share representing one one -thousandth of a share of the Company s newly issued Class N Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value per share Class N Preferred Stock ). During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred expense s of million associated with the RPT Merger, primarily comprised of severance, legal and professional fees.

The Company is in the process of reviewing the assumptions and inputs used by the third-party valuation specialist to ensure reasonableness and that the procedures are performed in accordance with management s policy. Therefore, the final acquisition accounting adjustments, including the purchase price and its allocation, are not yet complete as of this filing. Once the purchase price and allocation are complete, an adjustment to the provisional purchase price or allocation may occur. Additionally, any excess purchase price, which could differ materially, may result in the recognition of goodwill, the amount of which may be significant.

 interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts aggregating to million. The Company did not enter into any interest rate swap agreements during 2023. The interest rate swap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges and are held by the Company to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on variable rate debt. The differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or rece ived is accrued, as interest rates change, and recognized as Interest expense in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. If the hedges are deemed to be effective, the fair value is included within the Accumulated other comprehensive (loss)/income AOCI on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. As of September 30, 2024, all interest rate swaps were deemed effective and are therefore included within AOCI. As of September 30, 2024, the Company expects approximatel y million of a ccumulated comprehensive income on derivative instruments to be reclassified into earnings as a reduction to interest expense during the next 12 months. The interest rate swaps are measured at fair value using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts (or payments) and the discounted expected variable cash payments (or receipts). The variable cash payments (or receipts) are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. The Company classifies the interest rate swaps as Level 2 and are measured on a recurring basis.

The Company s involvement with these entities is through its majority ownership and management of the properties. The entities were deemed VIEs primarily because the unrelated investors do not have substantive kick-out rights to remove the general or managing partner by a vote of a simple majority or less, and they do not have substantive participating rights.

This preferred equity investment was primarily established to develop real estate property for long-term investment and was deemed a VIE primarily based on the fact that the equity investment at risk was not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support. The initial equity contributed to this entity was not sufficient to fully finance the real estate construction as development costs are funded by the partners over the construction period. The Company determined that it was not the primary beneficiary of this VIE based on the fact that the Company has shared control of this entity along with the entity s partners and therefore does not have a controlling financial interest.

 Executive Overview 
 Kimco Realty Corporation is a REIT, of which substantially all of the Company s assets are held by, and substantially all of the Company s operations are conducted through, Kimco OP, either directly or through its subsidiaries, as the Company s operating company. The Company is the managing member and exercises exclusive control over Kimco OP. As of September 30, 2024, the Parent Company owned 99.84 of the outstanding limited liability company interests (the OP Units in Kimco OP. 
 43 

The Company is North America s largest publicly traded owner and operator of open-air, grocery-anchored shopping centers and a growing portfolio of mixed-use assets. The terms Kimco, the Company, we, our and us each refers to Kimco Realty Corporation and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. The Company s mission is to create destinations for everyday living that inspire a sense of community and deliver value to our many stakeholders. 
 The Company is a self-administered real estate investment trust REIT and has owned and operated open-air shopping centers for over 60 years. The Company has not engaged, nor does it expect to retain, any REIT advisors in connection with the operation of its properties. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had interests in 567 U.S. shopping center properties, aggregating 100.5 million square feet of gross leasable area GLA ), located in 30 states. In addition, the Company had 67 other property interests, primarily including net leased properties, preferred equity investments, and other investments, totaling 5.5 million square feet of GLA. The Company s ownership interests in real estate consist of its consolidated portfolio and portfolios where the Company owns an economic interest, such as properties in the Company s investment real estate management programs, where the Company partners with institutional investors and also retains management. 
 The Company s primary business objective is to be the premier owner and operator of open-air, grocery-anchored shopping centers, and a growing portfolio of mixed-use assets, in the U.S. The Company believes it can achieve this objective by: 
 increasing the value of its existing portfolio of properties and generating higher levels of portfolio growth; 

increasing cash flows for reinvestment and/or for distribution to shareholders while maintaining conservative payout ratios; 

maintaining strong debt metrics and our A-/BBB+/Baa1 unsecured debt ratings; 

continuing growth in desirable demographic areas with successful retailers, primarily focused on grocery anchors; and 

increasing the number of entitlements for residential use. 

On September 9, 2024, Fitch Ratings assigned the Company a rating of A- for its senior unsecured debt, assigned a BBB credit rating for its preferred stock, and assigned its Stable rating outlook. As a result, the Company achieved certain interest rate reductions and facility fee reduction for its unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility and unsecured term loans. 
 RPT Merger 
 On January 2, 2024, RPT Realty merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving public company, pursuant to the definitive merger agreement (the Merger Agreement between the Company and RPT, which was entered into on August 28, 2023. As a result of the RPT Merger, three Company acquired 56 open-air shopping centers, including 43 wholly owned and 13 joint venture assets, comprising 13.3 million square feet of gross leasable area, to the Company s existing portfolio. The Company also obtained RPT s 6 stake in a 49-property net lease joint venture. 
 Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each RPT common share was converted into 0.6049 of a newly issued share of the Company s common stock, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares, and each 7.25 Series D Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Share of RPT was converted into the right to receive one depositary share representing one one-thousandth of a share of the Company s 7.25 Class N Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value 1.00 per share (the Class N Preferred Stock ). In connection with the RPT Merger, the Company issued 53.0 million shares of common stock, 1,849 shares of Class N Preferred Stock, and 953,400 OP Units. See Footnote 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the RPT Merger. 
 Economic Conditions 
 The economy continues to face challenges which could impact the Company and its tenants, including elevated inflation rates. In response to the elevated rate of inflation, the Federal Reserve steadily increased interest rates in 2022 and 2023. During September 2024, the Federal Reserve reduced the target range for federal funds rate by 0.50 to 4.75 -5.00 , which cut its overnight borrowing rate by 0.50 , as it believed certain indicators suggested that economic activity has continued to expand and inflation has made downward progress. This reduction is intended to support growth and stabilize the labor market. Fluctuations of certain economic data and indicators could impact future interest rate considerations by the Federal Reserve. Despite this reduction, interest rate levels could adversely impact the business and financial results of the Company and its tenants. In addition, slower economic growth and the potential for a recession could have an adverse effect on the Company and its tenants. This could negatively affect the overall demand for retail space, including the demand for leasable space in the Company s properties. 
 Any of these events could materially adversely impact the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price. The Company continues to monitor economic, financial, and social conditions and will assess its asset portfolio for any impairment indicators. If the Company determines that any of its assets are impaired, the Company would be required to take impairment charges, and such amounts could be material. 
 44 

Effects of Inflation 
 Many of the Company s long-term leases contain provisions designed to help mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. Such provisions include clauses enabling the Company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants gross sales above pre-determined thresholds, which generally increase as prices rise, and/or as a result of escalation clauses, which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases. Such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices. In addition, many of the Company s leases are for terms of less than 10 years, which permits the Company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal. To assist in partially mitigating the Company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses, including common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance, resulting from inflation, the Company s leases include provisions that either (i) require the tenant to pay an allocable share of these operating expenses or (ii) contain fixed contractual amounts, which include escalation clauses, to reimburse these operating expenses.

 Revenues from rental properties, net 
 The increase in Revenues from rental properties, net of 61.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in 2023, is primarily from (i) a net increase in revenues from tenants of 44.0 million due to properties acquired through the RPT Merger, (ii) a net increase in revenues from tenants of 16.7 million, primarily due to an increase in leasing activity and net growth in the current portfolio, and (iii) an increase in revenues of 3.0 million due to properties acquired during 2023, partially offset by (iv) a decrease in net straight-line rental income of 2.2 million and (v) a decrease in revenues of 0.4 million due to dispositions during 2024 and 2023.

 Real estate taxes 
 The increase in Real estate taxes of 7.1 million and 21.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023, is primarily due to properties acquired during 2024 and 2023, primarily related to the RPT Merger, partially offset by dispositions during 2024 and 2023. 
 Operating and maintenance 
 The increase in Operating and maintenance expense of 12.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in 2023, is primarily due to (i) an increase of 8.4 million resulting from properties acquired related to the RPT Merger and (ii) an increase in repairs and maintenance expense of 3.5 million. 
 The increase in Operating and maintenance expense of 35.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in 2023, is primarily due to (i) an increase of 25.0 million resulting from properties acquired related to the RPT Merger and (ii) an increase in repairs and maintenance expense of 9.5 million.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold its remaining 14.2 million shares of ACI common stock held by the Company, generating net proceeds of 299.1 million. For tax purposes, the Company recognized a long-term capital gain of 288.7 million. The Company anticipates retaining the proceeds from this stock sale for general corporate purposes and, as a result, recorded federal and state income taxes of 72.9 million on the taxable gain. 
 The Parent Company guarantees the unsecured debt instruments of Kimco OP. These guarantees by the Parent Company are full, irrevocable, unconditional and absolute joint and several guarantees to the holders of each series of such unsecured debt instruments. 
 The Company has issued letters of credit in connection with completion and repayment guarantees, primarily on certain of the Company s redevelopment projects and guaranty of payment related to the Company s insurance program. At September 30, 2024, these letters of credit aggregated 39.8 million. 
 The Company has investments with funding commitments of 27.5 million, of which 19.3 million has been funded as of September 30, 2024. 
 In connection with the construction of its development and redevelopment projects and related infrastructure, certain public agencies require posting of performance and surety bonds to guarantee that the Company s obligations are satisfied. These bonds expire upon the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. As of September 30, 2024, there were 16.2 million in performance and surety bonds outstanding. 
 The Company provides a guaranty for the payment of any debt service shortfalls on the Sheridan Redevelopment Agency issued Series A bonds, which are tax increment revenue bonds issued in connection with a development project in Sheridan, Colorado. These tax increment revenue bonds have a balance of 41.0 million outstanding at September 30, 2024. The bonds are to be repaid with incremental sales and property taxes and a public improvement fee ("PIF") to be assessed on current and future retail sales and, to the extent necessary, any amounts we may have to provide under a guaranty. The revenue generated from incremental sales, property taxes and PIF have satisfied the debt service requirements to date. The incremental taxes and PIF are to remain intact until the earlier of the payment of the bond liability in full or 2040. 
 In connection with the RPT Merger, the Company provides a guaranty for the payment of any debt service shortfalls on the City of Jacksonville Series 2005A bonds, which are tax increment revenue bonds issued in connection with a redevelopment project in Jacksonville, FL.

 53 

bonds, including principal and interest, are 4.5 million as of September 30, 2024. There have been no payments made by the Company under this guaranty agreement to date and the Company does not expect to make any payments over the life of the agreement. 
 Dividends 
 In connection with its intention to continue to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company expects to continue paying regular dividends to its stockholders. These dividends will be paid from operating cash flows. The Company s Board of Directors will continue to evaluate the Company s dividend policy on a quarterly basis as it monitors sources of capital and evaluates the impact of the economy and capital markets availability on operating fundamentals. Since cash used to pay dividends reduces amounts available for capital investment, the Company generally intends to maintain a dividend payout ratio that reserves such amounts as it considers necessary for the expansion and renovation of shopping centers in its portfolio, debt reduction, the acquisition of interests in new properties and other investments as suitable opportunities arise and such other factors as the Board of Directors considers appropriate. Cash dividends paid for common and preferred stock for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 507.8 million and 446.6 million, respectively. 
 Although the Company receives substantially all of its rental payments on a monthly basis, it generally intends to continue paying dividends quarterly. Amounts accumulated in advance of each quarterly distribution will be invested by the Company in short-term money market or other suitable instruments with institutions that have high credit ratings. The Company s objective is to establish a dividend level that maintains compliance with the Company s REIT taxable income distribution requirements. On July 30, 2024, the Company s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend with respect to the Company s classes of preferred shares (Classes L, M and N), which were paid on October 15, 2024, to shareholders of record on October 1, 2024. In addition, the Company s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.24 per common share which was paid on September 19, 2024 to shareholders of record on September 5, 2024. 
 On October 29, 2024, the Company s Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends with respect to the Company s classes of preferred shares (Classes L, M and N), which are scheduled to be paid on January 15, 2025, to shareholders of record on January 2, 2025. Additionally, the Company s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.25 per common share, representing a 4.2 increase from the prior quarterly dividend of 0.24, payable on December 19, 2024 to shareholders of record on December 5, 2024. 
 Hurricane Impact 
 The Company incurred no significant damage to its properties in September and October 2024 as a result of hurricanes Helene and Milton, which primarily hit Florida, South Carolina and Georgia. 
 Funds From Operations 
 Funds From Operations FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure utilized to evaluate the operating performance of real estate companies. NAREIT defines FFO as net income/(loss) available to the Company s common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ), excluding (i) depreciation and amortization related to real estate, (ii) gains or losses from sales of certain real estate assets, (iii) gains and losses from change in control, (iv) impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity and (v) after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. The Company also made an election, in accordance with the NAREIT Funds From Operations White Paper-2018 Restatement, to exclude from its calculation of FFO (i) gains and losses on the sale of assets and impairments of assets incidental to its main business and (ii) mark-to-market changes in the value of its equity securities. As such, the Company does not include gains/impairments on land parcels, mark-to-market gains/losses from marketable securities, allowance for credit losses on mortgage receivables, gains/impairments on other investments or other amounts considered incidental to its main business in NAREIT defined FFO. 
 The Company presents FFO available to the Company s common shareholders as it considers it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO available to the Company s common shareholders when reporting results. Comparison of our presentation of FFO available to the Company s common shareholders to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by such REITs. 
 FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of real estate companies operating performances, which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, and therefore, should not be considered an alternative for net income or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity.

Same Property Net Operating Income Same property NOI 
 Same property NOI is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of real estate companies operating performance and should not be considered an alternative to net income in accordance with GAAP or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity. The Company considers Same property NOI as an important operating performance measure because it is frequently used by securities analysts and investors to measure only the net operating income of properties that have been owned by the Company for the entire current and prior year reporting periods. It excludes properties under redevelopment, development and pending stabilization; properties are deemed stabilized at the earlier of (i) reaching 90 leased or (ii) one year following a project s inclusion in operating real estate. Same property NOI assists in eliminating disparities in net income due to the development, acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented, and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the Company's properties. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company included Same property NOI from the RPT properties acquired through the RPT Merger, as the Company owned these properties for the full three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The amount of the adjustment relating to RPT same property NOI for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, included in the table below, represents the Same property NOI from RPT properties prior to the RPT Merger, which is not included in the Company's Net income available to the Company s common shareholders. 
 Same property NOI is calculated using revenues from rental properties (excluding straight-line rent adjustments, lease termination fees, TIFs and amortization of above/below market rents) less charges for credit losses, operating and maintenance expense, real estate taxes and rent expense plus the Company s proportionate share of Same property NOI from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, calculated on the same basis. The Company s method of calculating Same property NOI available to the Company s common shareholders may differ from methods used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.

Same property NOI increased by 12.2 million, or 3.3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in 2023. This increase is primarily the result of (i) a net increase of 11.7 million, primarily related to an increase in rental revenue driven by strong leasing activity and (ii) a decrease in non-recoverable operating expenses of 0.5 million. 
 Same property NOI increased by 36.3 million, or 3.3 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in 2023. This increase is primarily the result of (i) a net increase of 31.5 million, primarily related to an increase in rental revenue driven by strong leasing activity and (ii) a decrease in non-recoverable operating expenses of 4.8 million. 
 Leasing Activity 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company executed 1,205 leases totaling 8.0 million square feet in the Company s consolidated operating portfolio, comprised of 326 new leases and 879 renewals and options. The leasing costs associated with these new leases are estimated to aggregate 67.0 million, or 39.21 per square foot. These costs include 51.3 million of tenant improvements and 15.7 million of external leasing commissions. The average rent per square foot for (i) new leases was 22.97 and (ii) renewals and options was 19.44.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclos ures About Market Risk. 
 The Company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. The Company periodically evaluates its exposure to short-term interest rates and will, from time-to-time, enter into interest rate protection agreements which mitigate, but do not eliminate, the effect of changes in interest rates on its floating-rate debt. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 26 interest rate swaps with notional amounts aggregating to 860.0 million. The interest rate swap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges and are held by the Company to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on variable rate debt. The hedged debt is reflected as fixed rate unsecured debt in the table below. The Company has not entered, and does not plan to enter, into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
 The following table presents the carrying value of the Company s aggregate fixed rate and variable rate debt obligations outstanding, including fair market value adjustments and unamortized deferred financing costs, as of September 30, 2024, with corresponding weighted-average interest rates sorted by maturity date. In addition, the following table presents the fair value of the Company s debt obligations outstanding, excluding unamortized deferred financing costs. The table does not include extension options where available (amounts in millions).
