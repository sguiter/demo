 million to million. Select also made a voluntary prepayment of million on its term loan and a million repayment on its revolving credit facility using the proceeds derived from the Concentra IPO and debt transactions, as described in Note 15, Concentra Separation . During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a million loss on early retirement of debt as a result of the prepayment on its term loan and Amendment No. 10 to the Select credit agreement. 
 Concentra Credit Facilities 
 On July 26, 2024, Concentra Health Services, Inc. CHSI ), a then wholly-owned subsidiary of Concentra, entered into a senior secured credit agreement (the Concentra credit agreement that provides for an million term loan (the Concentra term loan ), and a million revolving credit facility, including a million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit (the Concentra revolving credit facility and, together with the Concentra term loan, the Concentra credit facilities ). 
 Borrowings under the Concentra credit facilities are guaranteed by Concentra and substantially all of Concentra's current domestic subsidiaries and will be guaranteed by CHSI s future domestic subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of Concentra s existing and future property and assets and by a pledge of Concentra s capital stock, the capital stock of CHSI s domestic subsidiaries and up to of the capital stock of CHSI s foreign subsidiaries held directly by CHSI or a domestic subsidiary. 
 Borrowings under the Concentra credit agreement bear interest at a rate equal to: (i) in the case of the Concentra term loan, Term SOFR plus a percentage ranging from to , or Alternate Base Rate plus a percentage ranging from to , in each case based on CHSI s leverage ratio; and (ii) in the case of the Concentra revolving credit facility, Term SOFR plus a percentage ranging from to , or Alternate Base Rate plus a percentage ranging from to , in each case on CHSI s leverage ratio, as defined in the Concentra credit agreement. 
 The Concentra term loan amortizes in equal quarterly installments in amounts equal to of the aggregate original principal amount of the Concentra term loan commencing on December 31, 2024. The balance of the Concentra term loan will be payable on July 26, 2031. Similarly, the Concentra revolving credit facility will be payable on July 26, 2029. 
 The Concentra credit facilities require CHSI to maintain a leverage ratio (as defined in the Concentra credit agreement), which is tested quarterly and currently must not be greater than to 1.00. Failure to comply with this covenant would result in an event of default under the Concentra revolving credit facility and, absent a waiver or an amendment from the revolving lenders, preclude CHSI from making further borrowings under the Concentra revolving credit facility and permit the revolving lenders to accelerate all outstanding borrowings under the Concentra revolving credit facility. Upon termination of the commitments for the Concentra revolving credit facility and acceleration of all outstanding borrowings thereunder, failure to comply with the covenant also would constitute an event of default with respect to the Concentra term loan. 
 The Concentra credit facilities also contain a number of other affirmative and restrictive covenants, including limitations on mergers, consolidations and dissolutions; sales of assets; investments and acquisitions; indebtedness; liens; affiliate transactions; and dividends and restricted payments. The Concentra credit facilities contain events of default for non-payment of principal and interest when due, cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions and an event of default that would be triggered by a change of control. 
 Prepayment of borrowings 
 CHSI will be required to prepay borrowings under the Concentra credit facilities with (i) of the net cash proceeds received from non-ordinary course asset sales or other dispositions, or as a result of a casualty or condemnation, subject to reinvestment provisions and other customary carveouts and, to the extent required, the payment of certain indebtedness secured by liens subject to a first lien intercreditor agreement if CHSI s total net leverage ratio is greater than to 1.00 and of such net cash proceeds if our total net leverage ratio is less than or equal to to 1.00 and greater than to 1.00, (ii) of the net cash proceeds received from the issuance of debt obligations other than certain permitted debt obligations, and (iii) of excess cash flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement) if CHSI s leverage ratio is greater than to 1.00 and of excess cash flow if CHSI s leverage ratio is less than or equal to to 1.00 and greater than to 1.00, in each case, reduced by the aggregate amount of term loans, revolving loans and certain other debt optionally prepaid (and, in the case of revolving loans, accompanied by a reduction in the related commitment) during the applicable fiscal year. CHSI will not be required to prepay borrowings with excess cash flow or the net cash proceeds of asset sales if CHSI s leverage ratio is less than or equal to to 1.00.

 Senior Notes 
 On July 11, 2024, the Company completed a private offering by its then wholly-owned subsidiary, Concentra Escrow Issuer Corporation (the Escrow Issuer ), of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due July 15, 2032 (the Concentra senior notes ). On July 26, 2024, Escrow Issuer merged with and into CHSI, with CHSI continuing as the surviving entity, and CHSI assumed all of the Escrow Issuer s obligations under the senior notes. The Concentra senior notes are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by Concentra and certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Interest on the Concentra senior notes accrues at a rate of per annum and is payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing on January 15, 2025.

 on billion of principal outstanding under the term loan, as the interest rate cap provided for payments from the counterparty when interest rates rose above . The interest rate cap, which expired on September 30, 2024, had a billion notional amount. The Company paid a monthly premium for the interest rate cap over the term of the agreement. The annual premium was equal to of the notional amount, or approximately million. 
 The interest rate cap was designated as a cash flow hedge and was highly effective at offsetting the changes in cash outflows when the variable rate index exceeded . Changes in the fair value of the interest rate cap, net of tax, were recognized in other comprehensive income and reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and into interest expense when the hedged interest obligations affected earnings. At June 30, 2024, we determined that a portion of the underlying cash flows related to our hedging relationship was probable not to occur. Accordingly, we reclassified changes in the fair value of the interest rate cap, net of tax, related to these cash flows out of accumulated other comprehensive income and into interest expense during the three months ended June 30, 2024. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the interest rate cap related to these cash flows were recorded to interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 million for professional malpractice liability insurance and million for general liability insurance. For the Company s Concentra center operations, the Company currently maintains insurance coverages under a combination of policies with a total annual aggregate limit of up to million for professional malpractice liability insurance and million for general liability insurance. The Company s insurance for the professional liability coverage is written on a claims-made basis, and its commercial general liability coverage is maintained on an occurrence basis. These coverages apply after a self-insured retention limit is exceeded. For the Company s joint venture operations, the Company has designed a separate insurance program that responds to the risks of specific joint ventures. Most of the Company s joint ventures are insured under a master program with an annual aggregate limit of up to million, subject to a sublimit aggregate ranging from million to million. The policies are generally written on a claims-made basis. Each of these programs has either a deductible or self-insured retention limit. The Company also maintains additional types of liability insurance covering claims which, due to their nature or amount, are not covered by or not fully covered by the applicable professional malpractice and general liability insurance policies, including workers compensation, property and casualty, directors and officers, cyber liability insurance, and employment practices liability insurance coverages. Our insurance policies generally are silent with respect to punitive damages so coverage is available to the extent insurable under the law of any applicable jurisdiction, and are subject to various deductibles and policy limits. The Company reviews its insurance program annually and may make adjustments to the amount of insurance coverage and self-insured retentions in future years. Significant legal actions, as well as the cost and possible lack of available insurance, could subject the Company to substantial uninsured liabilities.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 You should read this discussion together with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. 
 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 This report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include statements preceded by, followed by or that include the words may, could, would, should, believe, expect, anticipate, plan, target, estimate, project, intend, and similar expressions. These statements include, among others, statements regarding our expected business outlook, anticipated financial and operating results, including the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on those financial and operating results, our business strategy and means to implement our strategy, our objectives, the amount and timing of capital expenditures, the likelihood of our success in expanding our business, financing plans, budgets, working capital needs, and sources of liquidity. 
 Forward-looking statements are only predictions and are not guarantees of performance. These statements are based on our management s beliefs and assumptions, which in turn are based on currently available information. Important assumptions relating to the forward-looking statements include, among others, assumptions regarding our services, the expansion of our services, competitive conditions, and general economic conditions. These assumptions could prove inaccurate. Forward-looking statements also involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 changes in government reimbursement for our services and/or new payment policies may result in a reduction in revenue, an increase in costs, and a reduction in profitability; 
 adverse economic conditions including an inflationary environment could cause us to continue to experience increases in the prices of labor and other costs of doing business resulting in a negative impact on our business, operating results, cash flows, and financial condition; 
 shortages in qualified nurses, therapists, physicians, or other licensed providers, and/or the inability to attract or retain qualified healthcare professionals could limit our ability to staff our facilities; 
 shortages in qualified health professionals could cause us to increase our dependence on contract labor, increase our efforts to recruit and train new employees, and expand upon our initiatives to retain existing staff, which could increase our operating costs significantly; 
 public threats such as a global pandemic, or widespread outbreak of an infectious disease, similar to the COVID-19 pandemic, could negatively impact patient volumes and revenues, increase labor and other operating costs, disrupt global financial markets, and/or further legislative and regulatory actions which impact healthcare providers, including actions that may impact the Medicare program; 
 the failure of our Medicare-certified long term care hospitals or inpatient rehabilitation facilities to maintain their Medicare certifications may cause our revenue and profitability to decline; 
 the failure of our Medicare-certified long term care hospitals and inpatient rehabilitation facilities operated as hospitals within hospitals to qualify as hospitals separate from their host hospitals may cause our revenue and profitability to decline; 
 a government investigation or assertion that we have violated applicable regulations may result in sanctions or reputational harm and increased costs; 
 acquisitions or joint ventures may prove difficult or unsuccessful, use significant resources, or expose us to unforeseen liabilities; 
 our plans and expectations related to our acquisitions and our ability to realize anticipated synergies; 
 failure to complete or achieve some or all the expected benefits of the potential separation of Concentra; 
 private third-party payors for our services may adopt payment policies that could limit our future revenue and profitability;

 the failure to maintain established relationships with the physicians in the areas we serve could reduce our revenue and profitability; 
 competition may limit our ability to grow and result in a decrease in our revenue and profitability; 
 the loss of key members of our management team could significantly disrupt our operations; 
 the effect of claims asserted against us could subject us to substantial uninsured liabilities; 
 a security breach of our or our third-party vendors information technology systems may subject us to potential legal and reputational harm and may result in a violation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 or the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act; and 
 other factors discussed from time to time in our filings with the SEC, including factors discussed under the heading Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States and the rules and regulations of the SEC, we are under no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of any new information, future events, or otherwise. You should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results or performance. 
 Investors should also be aware that while we do, from time to time, communicate with securities analysts, it is against our policy to disclose to securities analysts any material non-public information or other confidential commercial information. Accordingly, stockholders should not assume that we agree with any statement or report issued by any securities analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report. Thus, to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections, forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of the Company.

 Overview 
 We began operations in 1997 and, based on number of facilities, are one of the largest operators of critical illness recovery hospitals, rehabilitation hospitals, outpatient rehabilitation clinics, and occupational health centers in the United States. As of September 30, 2024, we had operations in 46 states and the District of Columbia. We operated 106 critical illness recovery hospitals in 29 states, 34 rehabilitation hospitals in 13 states, 1,925 outpatient rehabilitation clinics in 39 states and the District of Columbia, 549 occupational health centers in 41 states, and 156 onsite clinics at employer worksites. 
 Our reportable segments include the critical illness recovery hospital segment, the rehabilitation hospital segment, the outpatient rehabilitation segment, and the Concentra segment. We had revenue of 5,309.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Of this total, we earned approximately 35 of our revenue from our critical illness recovery hospital segment, approximately 15 from our rehabilitation hospital segment, approximately 18 from our outpatient rehabilitation segment, and approximately 27 from our Concentra segment. Our critical illness recovery hospital segment consists of hospitals designed to serve the needs of patients recovering from critical illnesses, often with complex medical needs, and our rehabilitation hospital segment consists of hospitals designed to serve patients that require intensive physical rehabilitation care. Patients are typically admitted to our critical illness recovery hospitals and rehabilitation hospitals from general acute care hospitals. Our outpatient rehabilitation segment consists of clinics that provide physical, occupational, and speech rehabilitation services. Our Concentra segment consists of occupational health centers that provide workers compensation injury care, physical therapy, and consumer health services as well as onsite clinics located at employer worksites that deliver occupational health services. 
 Concentra Separation 
 On July 26, 2024, Concentra Group Holdings Parent Concentra ), a then wholly-owned subsidiary of Select, completed an initial public offering IPO of 22,500,000 shares of its common stock, par value 0.01 per share, at an initial public offering price of 23.50 per share for net proceeds of 499.7 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commission of 29.1 million. In addition, the underwriters exercised the option to purchase an additional 750,000 shares of the Concentra s common stock for net proceeds of 16.7 million after deducting discounts and commission of 1.0 million. Concentra shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CON on July 25, 2024. 
 After the closing of the IPO and underwriter option, Select owns 81.74 of the total outstanding shares of Concentra common stock, and continues to consolidate the financial results of Concentra. Select intends to make a distribution, which is intended to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, to its stockholders of all of its remaining equity interest in Concentra within twelve months of the IPO. 
 Impact of the Change Healthcare Cybersecurity Incident 
 On February 22, 2024, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated indicated in a Form 8-K filing, that a cyber security threat actor had gained access to some of its Change Healthcare information technology systems. Upon receiving notification of the incident, we severed connectivity with all Change Healthcare-related systems and we are not aware of any impact on our own information technology systems. However, as a result of the incident, certain of our patient billing and collections processes were disrupted and alternative platforms needed to be enabled to resume normal patient billing and collections operations. The Company began to reconnect to certain applications during March 2024, and since then there has been a significant reduction in our claims processing backlog, resulting in a decrease in our days sales outstanding. We expect a further reduction in the resulting impact on our days sales outstanding during the fourth quarter of 2024.

 Non-GAAP Measure 
 We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, as defined below, is important to investors because Adjusted EBITDA is commonly used as an analytical indicator of performance by investors within the healthcare industry. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to evaluate financial performance and determine resource allocation for each of our segments. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or substitute for, net income, income from operations, cash flows generated by operations, investing or financing activities, or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and is thus susceptible to varying definitions, Adjusted EBITDA as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings excluding interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, gain (loss) on early retirement of debt, stock compensation expense, transaction costs associated with the Concentra separation, gain (loss) on sale of businesses, and equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries. We will refer to Adjusted EBITDA throughout the remainder of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following table reconciles net income and income from operations to Adjusted EBITDA and should be referenced when we discuss Adjusted EBITDA:

 Regulatory Changes 
 Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024, contains a detailed discussion of the regulations that affect our business in Part I Business Government Regulations. The following is a discussion of some of the more significant healthcare regulatory changes that have affected our financial performance in the periods covered by this report, or are likely to affect our financial performance and financial condition in the future. The information below should be read in conjunction with the more detailed discussion of regulations contained in our Form 10-K. 
 Medicare Reimbursement 
 The Medicare program reimburses healthcare providers for services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries, which are generally persons age 65 and older, those who are chronically disabled, and those suffering from end stage renal disease. The program is governed by the Social Security Act of 1965 and is administered primarily by the Department of Health and Human Services HHS and CMS. Revenue generated directly from the Medicare program represented approximately 21 and 22 of our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and for the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Federal Health Care Program Changes in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic 
 On January 31, 2020, HHS declared a public health emergency under section 319 of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 247d, in response to the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States. The HHS Secretary renewed the public health emergency determination for subsequent 90-day periods through May 11, 2023, the end of the public health emergency. The COVID-19 national emergency that was declared by President Trump on March 13, 2020, which was separate from the public health emergency, ended on April 10, 2023 when H.R.J. Res. 7 was signed into law. 
 As a result of the COVID-19 national emergency, the HHS Secretary authorized the waiver or modification of certain requirements under Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children s Health Insurance Program CHIP pursuant to section 1135 of the Social Security Act. Under this authority, CMS issued a number of blanket waivers that excused health care providers or suppliers from specific program requirements. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, contains a detailed discussion of the federal health care program changes made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including these COVID-19 waivers, in Part II Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Regulatory Changes. Most of these COVID-19 waivers, including the waiver of the Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility IRF 60 Rule and the waiver of Medicare statutory requirements regarding site neutral payments to long-term care hospitals LTCHs ), ended for new admissions when the public health emergency expired on May 11, 2023. However, LTCHs were exempt from the greater-than-25-day average length of stay requirement for all cost reporting periods that include the COVID-19 public health emergency period. As a result, LTCH cost reporting periods that started prior to May 11, 2023, were exempt for the remainder of that cost reporting year. However, LTCH cost reporting periods that began on or after May 11, 2023, must comply with the greater-than-25-day average length of stay requirement. 
 In addition, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security CARES Act and related legislation temporarily suspended the 2 cut to Medicare payments due to sequestration from May 1, 2020, through March 31, 2022, and reduced the sequestration adjustment from 2 to 1 from April 1 through June 30, 2022. The full 2 reduction resumed on July 1, 2022. To pay for this relief, Congress increased the sequestration cut to Medicare payments to 2.25 for the first six months of fiscal year 2030 and to 3 for the final six months of fiscal year 2030. Additionally, an across-the-board 4 payment cut required to take effect in January 2022 due to the American Rescue Plan from the FY 2022 Statutory Pay-As-You-Go PAYGO scorecard was deferred by Congress until 2025. 
 The CARES Act and related legislation also provided more than 178 billion in appropriations for the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund, also known as the Provider Relief Fund, to be used for preventing, preparing, and responding to COVID-19 and for reimbursing eligible health care providers for health care related expenses or lost revenues that are attributable to coronavirus. HHS began distributing these funds to providers in April 2020. Recipients of payments were required to report data to HHS on the use of the funds via an online portal by specific deadlines established by HHS based on the date of the payment. All recipients of funds are subject to audit by HHS, the HHS OIG, or the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee. Audits may include examination of the accuracy of the data providers submitted to HHS in their applications for payments. Additional distributions are not expected and as a result, the Company does not expect to recognize additional income associated with these funds in the future.

 Medicare Reimbursement of LTCH Services 
 The following is a summary of significant regulatory changes to the Medicare prospective payment system for our critical illness recovery hospitals, which are certified by Medicare as LTCHs, which have affected our results of operations, as well as the policies and payment rates that may affect our future results of operations. Medicare payments to our critical illness recovery hospitals are made in accordance with the long-term care hospital prospective payment system LTCH-PPS ). 
 Fiscal Year 2023 . On August 10, 2022, CMS published the final rule updating policies and payment rates for the LTCH-PPS for fiscal year 2023 (affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2022, through September 30, 2023). Certain errors in the final rule were corrected in documents published November 4, 2022, and December 13, 2022. The standard federal rate for fiscal year 2023 was set at 46,433, an increase from the standard federal rate applicable during fiscal year 2022 of 44,714. The update to the standard federal rate for fiscal year 2023 included a market basket increase of 4.1 , less a productivity adjustment of 0.3 . The standard federal rate also included an area wage budget neutrality factor of 1.0004304. As a result of the CARES Act, all LTCH cases were paid at the standard federal rate during the public health emergency. When the public health emergency ended on May 11, 2023, CMS returned to using the site-neutral payment rate for reimbursement of cases that do not meet the LTCH patient criteria. The fixed-loss amount for high cost outlier cases paid under LTCH-PPS was set at 38,518, an increase from the fixed-loss amount in the 2022 fiscal year of 33,015. The fixed-loss amount for high cost outlier cases paid under the site-neutral payment rate was set at 38,788, an increase from the fixed-loss amount in the 2022 fiscal year of 30,988. 
 Fiscal Year 2024. On August 28, 2023, CMS published the final rule updating policies and payment rates for the LTCH-PPS for fiscal year 2024 (affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2023, through September 30, 2024). Certain errors in the final rule were corrected in a document published on October 4, 2023. The standard federal rate for fiscal year 2024 was set at 48,117, an increase from the standard federal rate applicable during fiscal year 2023 of 46,433. The update to the standard federal rate for fiscal year 2024 included a market basket increase of 3.5 , less a productivity adjustment of 0.2 . The standard federal rate also included an area wage budget neutrality factor of 1.0031599. The fixed-loss amount for high cost outlier cases paid under LTCH-PPS was set at 59,873, an increase from the fixed-loss amount in the 2023 fiscal year of 38,518. The fixed-loss amount for high cost outlier cases paid under the site-neutral payment rate was set at 42,750, an increase from the fixed-loss amount in the 2023 fiscal year of 38,788. 
 Fiscal Year 2025. On August 28, 2024, CMS published the final rule updating policies and payment rates for the LTCH-PPS for fiscal year 2025 (affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2024, through September 30, 2025). Certain errors in the final rule were corrected in a document published on October 2, 2024. In an interim final action document published on October 3, 2024, CMS also made modifications to the fiscal year 2025 policies and payment rates as a result of a recent decision issued by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The standard federal rate for fiscal year 2025 is 49,383, an increase from the standard federal rate applicable during fiscal year 2024 of 48,117. The update to the standard federal rate for fiscal year 2025 includes a market basket increase of 3.5 , less a productivity adjustment of 0.5 . The standard federal rate also includes an area wage budget neutrality factor of 0.9964315. The fixed-loss amount for high cost outlier cases paid under LTCH-PPS is 77,048, an increase from the fixed-loss amount in the 2024 fiscal year of 59,873. The fixed-loss amount for high cost outlier cases paid under the site-neutral payment rate is 46,217, an increase from the fixed-loss amount in the 2024 fiscal year of 42,750. 
 Criteria for Reconciliation of Outlier Payments 
 Under the LTCH PPS, CMS makes two types of outlier payments to LTCHs. First, CMS makes additional payments to LTCHs for high cost outlier cases that have extraordinarily high costs relative to the costs of most discharges. For these cases, CMS sets a fixed loss amount each year that represents the maximum loss an LTCH will incur for a case before qualifying for a high cost outlier payment. A high cost outlier threshold equal to the LTCH PPS adjusted Federal payment for the case plus the fixed loss amount determines when Medicare pays a high cost outlier payment. Such payments are based on 80 of the estimated cost of the case above the high cost outlier threshold. Second, CMS reduces payments to LTCHs for patients with a relatively short stay, which is defined as a length of stay less than or equal to five-sixths of the geometric average length of stay for that particular MS-LTC-DRG. Short stay outlier cases are paid using a per diem rate based on 120 of the MS-LTC-DRG specific per diem amount and an IPPS per diem amount.

 Outlier payments made to LTCHs during the cost reporting year may be reconciled at cost report settlement by the Medicare Administrative Contractor MAC if certain criteria are met. According to CMS, the reconciliation of outlier payments is intended to account for the fact that the LTCH s cost-to-charge ratio CCR used to pay Medicare claims during the cost reporting year may differ from the LTCH s final CCR for the year calculated by the MAC at cost report settlement. The outlier reconciliation criteria were: (1) a change in the LTCH s CCR of 10 percentage points or more when comparing the actual CCR to the CCR used during the cost reporting period to make outlier payments; and (2) the LTCH received at least 500,000 in outlier payments during the cost reporting period. If the criteria for outlier reconciliation are met, the MAC will conduct an outlier reconciliation to determine whether the LTCH was overpaid or underpaid for outlier cases. If the LTCH was overpaid, the LTCH must repay Medicare in the amount of the overpayment plus the time value of money i.e. , interest). If the LTCH was underpaid, Medicare must pay the LTCH in the amount of the underpayment plus the time value of money. 
 On April 26, 2024, CMS issued new guidance in Transmittal 12594 changing the criteria for LTCH outlier reconciliations. CMS modified the first criterion to a change in the LTCH s CCR of 20 percent or more from the CCR used to make outlier payments during the cost reporting period. CMS did not change the second criterion for reconciliation that the LTCH must have received at least 500,000 in outlier payments during the cost reporting period. The revised policy is effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2024. However, CMS notes that MACs would receive the first cost reports subject to the revised policy in March 2026. 
 Setting the threshold at 20 percent for changes in the hospital s CCR will result in more outlier reconciliations. This increases the likelihood that LTCHs will have a portion of their outlier payments recouped by the MAC at cost report settlement. Because outlier reconciliations often delay the final settlement of cost reports, and providers cannot appeal disputed reimbursement amounts until the cost report is settled, this new policy will likely delay more reimbursement appeals related to LTCH cost reports. 
 Medicare Reimbursement of IRF Services 
 The following is a summary of significant regulatory changes to the Medicare prospective payment system for our rehabilitation hospitals, which are certified by Medicare as IRFs, which have affected our results of operations, as well as the policies and payment rates that may affect our future results of operations. Medicare payments to our rehabilitation hospitals are made in accordance with the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system IRF-PPS ). 
 Fiscal Year 2023. On August 1, 2022, CMS published the final rule updating policies and payment rates for the IRF-PPS for fiscal year 2023 (affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2022, through September 30, 2023). The standard payment conversion factor for discharges for fiscal year 2023 was set at 17,878, an increase from the standard payment conversion factor applicable during fiscal year 2022 of 17,240. The update to the standard payment conversion factor for fiscal year 2023 included a market basket increase of 4.2 , less a productivity adjustment of 0.3 . CMS increased the outlier threshold amount for fiscal year 2023 to 12,526 from 9,491 established in the final rule for fiscal year 2022. 
 Fiscal Year 2024. On August 2, 2023, CMS published the final rule to update policies and payment rates for the IRF-PPS for fiscal year 2024 (affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2023, through September 30, 2024). Certain errors in the final rule were corrected in a document published on October 4, 2023. The standard payment conversion factor for discharges for fiscal year 2024 was set at 18,541, an increase from the standard payment conversion factor applicable during fiscal year 2023 of 17,878. The update to the standard payment conversion factor for fiscal year 2024 included a market basket increase of 3.6 , less a productivity adjustment of 0.2 . CMS decreased the outlier threshold amount for fiscal year 2024 to 10,423 from 12,526 established in the final rule for fiscal year 2023. 
 Fiscal Year 2025. On August 6, 2024, CMS published the final rule to update policies and payment rates for the IRF-PPS for fiscal year 2025 (affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2024, through September 30, 2025). Certain errors in the final rule were corrected in a document published on October 2, 2024. The standard payment conversion factor for discharges for fiscal year 2025 was set at 18,907, an increase from the standard payment conversion factor applicable during fiscal year 2024 of 18,541. The update to the standard payment conversion factor for fiscal year 2025 included a market basket increase of 3.5 , less a productivity adjustment of 0.5 . CMS increased the outlier threshold amount for fiscal year 2025 to 12,043 from 10,423 established in the final rule for fiscal year 2024.

 Medicare Reimbursement of Outpatient Rehabilitation Clinic Services 
 Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 contains a detailed discussion of Medicare reimbursement that affects our outpatient rehabilitation clinic operations in Part I Business Government Regulations and in Part II Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Regulatory Changes. Outpatient rehabilitation providers enroll in Medicare as a rehabilitation agency, a clinic, or a public health agency. The Medicare program reimburses outpatient rehabilitation providers based on the Medicare physician fee schedule. 
 For calendar years 2021 and 2022, CMS s expected decreases in Medicare reimbursement under the physician fee schedule were mostly offset by one-time increases in payments as a result of legislation passed by Congress. Similarly, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, provided some relief from the payment cuts in calendar years 2023 and 2024. Payments under the 2023 physician fee schedule decreased by 2 , and for calendar year 2024, final CMS policies resulted in an approximate 3 decrease in Medicare payments for the therapy specialty. On March 9, 2024, President Biden signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, which mitigated Medicare physician payment cuts by 1.68 , resulting in a lower, 1.69 cut to payments. The full 3.37 cut was applied to payments for services provided between January 1, 2024 and the March 9, 2024 effective date. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024 also extends the Medicare physician work geographic index floor through December 31, 2024. The steps Congress has taken to reduce the cuts to Medicare physician payments for the remainder of 2024 are temporary and will not carry over into 2025. CMS has estimated that its proposed policies for 2025 will not result in any increase or decrease in Medicare payments for therapy specialty. However, in the calendar year 2025 physician fee schedule proposed rule, CMS calculated the estimated payment rates without the 1.25 and 2.93 payment increases under the Consolidated Appropriations of 2023 and 2024, respectively. Therefore, if enacted, the 2025 physician fee schedule proposed rule is expected to decrease Medicare reimbursement for therapy services by approximately 2.8 as compared to the reimbursement rates in effect for most of 2024. 
 Modifiers to Identify Services of Physical Therapy Assistants or Occupational Therapy Assistants 
 Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, contains a detailed discussion of Medicare regulations concerning services provided by physical therapy assistants and occupational therapy assistants in Part I Business Government Regulations and in Part II Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Regulatory Changes. There have been no significant updates to these regulations subsequently.

The increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries is principally due to a gain of 18.9 million recognized upon gaining a controlling financial interest in a previously unconsolidated entity. 
 Interest 
 Interest expense was 55.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 50.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense was principally due to a lower gain on the interest rate cap cash flow hedge, partially offset by a decrease from the reduction in total debt as a result of the Concentra and Select financing transactions, as described in Note 7. Long-Term Debt and Notes Payable .

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had revenue of 5,309.7 million and income from operations of 492.9 million, respectively, as compared to revenue of 5,005.2 million and income from operations of 440.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 The improvement in our financial performance for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was principally due to the increase in revenue in our Critical Illness Recovery Hospital and Rehabilitation Hospital segments, as discussed below under Revenue.

 Critical Illness Recovery Hospital Segment. Revenue increased 6.4 to 1,843.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1,732.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenue was principally attributable to revenue per patient day, which increased 4.8 to 2,175 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2,076 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our patient days increased 1.6 to 844,623 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 831,022 days for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Our patient visits were 9,628,515 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 9,766,881 visits for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses consist principally of cost of services and general and administrative expenses. Our operating expenses were 4,662.2 million, or 87.8 of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4,411.0 million, or 88.1 of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our cost of services, a major component of which is labor expense, was 4,516.6 million, or 85.1 of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4,284.9 million, or 85.6 of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in our operating expenses relative to our revenue was principally attributable to the decreased labor costs within our Critical Illness Recovery Hospital segment. General and administrative expenses were 145.7 million, or 2.7 of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 126.1 million, or 2.5 of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Our Adjusted EBITDA margin for the critical illness recovery hospital segment was 12.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 10.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases in our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, were principally due to an increase in revenue. Additionally, our total contract labor costs decreased by approximately 13 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was driven by an approximate 14 decrease in utilization of contract registered nurses and an approximate 4 decrease in the rate per hour for contract registered nurses.

Our Adjusted EBITDA margin for the outpatient rehabilitation segment was 8.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 10.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decreases in our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, were principally attributable due to higher labor costs, partially offset by an increase in revenue. 
 Concentra Segment. Adjusted EBITDA increased 2.1 to 299.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 293.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

The increase in income from operations is principally attributable to increases in revenue within our Critical Illness Recovery Hospital and Rehabilitation Hospital segments, as discussed above under Revenue . 
 Loss on Early Retirement of Debt

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 In the following, we discuss cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2024 (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities 402,616 392,432 Net cash used in investing activities (198,893) (156,818) Net cash used in financing activities (224,189) (128,152) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (20,466) 107,462 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 97,906 84,006 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period 77,440 191,468 
 Operating activities provided 392.4 million of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 402.6 million of cash flows provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decline in cash flows provided by operating activities year over year is principally due to an increase in accounts receivable, which was principally driven by an increase in revenue and the continued impact of the Change Healthcare matter. The decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities was partially offset by the increase in net income. 
 Our days sales outstanding was 55 days at September 30, 2024, compared to 52 days at December 31, 2023. Our days sales outstanding was 52 days at September 30, 2023, compared to 55 days at December 31, 2022. Our days sales outstanding will fluctuate based upon variability in our collection cycles and patient volumes and the continued impact of the Change Healthcare matter. 
 Investing activities used 156.8 million of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The principal uses of cash were 158.7 million for purchases of property, equipment, and other assets, and 2.3 million for investments in and acquisitions of businesses. The cash outflows were offset in part by proceeds received from the sale of assets and businesses of 4.2 million. Investing activities used 198.9 million of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The principal uses of cash were 168.6 million for purchases of property, equipment, and other assets, and 30.4 million for investments in and acquisitions of businesses. 
 Financing activities used 128.2 million of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The principal uses of cash were payments of 1,719.5 million on our term loan, 270.0 million of net repayments under our revolving facilities, 48.5 million of dividend payments to common stockholders, and 35.8 million for distributions to and purchases of non-controlling interests. The principal sources of cash were net proceeds from Concentra s term loans of 836.7 million, net proceeds from the issuance of Concentra s 6.875 senior notes of 637.3 million, and net proceeds from the Concentra's equity issuance of 511.2 million. Financing activities used 224.2 million of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Capital Resources 
 Working capital. We had net working capital of 158.5 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 9.2 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in net working capital was principally due to an increase in cash and accounts receivable. 
 Select Credit facilities. On July 26, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 10 to the Select credit agreement. Amendment No. 10 reduced the revolving credit facility commitments available under the credit agreement from 770.0 million to 550.0 million. Select also made a voluntary prepayment of 1,640.4 million on its term loan and a 300.0 million repayment on its revolving credit facility using the proceeds derived from the Concentra IPO and debt transactions. 
 At September 30, 2024, Select had outstanding borrowings under its credit facilities consisting of a 373.0 million term loan (excluding unamortized original issue discounts and debt issuance costs of 2.2 million) and borrowings of 10.0 million under its revolving facility. At September 30, 2024, Select had 496.6 million of availability under its revolving facility after giving effect to 43.4 million of outstanding letters of credit. 
 Concentra Credit facilities. On July 26, 2024, CHSI entered into the Concentra credit agreement that provides for an 850.0 million term loan, and a 400.0 million revolving credit facility, including a 75.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit. 
 Borrowings under the Concentra credit agreement bear interest at a rate equal to: (i) in the case of the Concentra term loan, Term SOFR plus a percentage ranging from 2.00 to 2.25 , or Alternate Base Rate plus a percentage ranging from 1.00 to 1.25 , in each case based on CHSI s leverage ratio; and (ii) in the case of the Concentra revolving credit facility, Term SOFR plus a percentage ranging from 2.25 to 2.75 , or Alternate Base Rate plus a percentage ranging from 1.25 to 1.75 , in each case on CHSI s leverage ratio, as defined in the Concentra credit agreement. 
 The Concentra term loan amortizes in equal quarterly installments in amounts equal to 0.25 of the aggregate original principal amount of the Concentra term loan commencing on December 31, 2024. The balance of the Concentra term loan will be payable on July 26, 2031. Similarly, the Concentra revolving credit facility will be payable on July 26, 2029. 
 The Concentra credit facilities require CHSI to maintain a leverage ratio (as defined in the Concentra credit agreement), which is tested quarterly and currently must not be greater than 6.50 to 1.00. Failure to comply with this covenant would result in an event of default under the Concentra revolving credit facility, absent a waiver or amendment from the lenders. CHSI will be required to prepay borrowings under the Concentra credit facilities upon cash proceeds from asset sales or dispositions, issuance of additional debt obligations, and excess cash flows, further outlined in the credit agreement. 
 At September 30, 2024, Concentra had outstanding borrowings under its credit facilities consisting of a 850.0 million term loan (excluding unamortized original issue discounts and debt issuance costs of 13.0 million). Concentra had no outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility. At September 30, 2024, Concentra had 386.4 million of availability under its revolving facility after giving effect to 13.6 million of outstanding letters of credit. 
 Concentra 6.875 Senior Notes. On July 11, 2024, the Company completed a private offering by its then wholly-owned subsidiary, the Escrow Issuer, of 650.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875 senior notes due July 15, 2032. On July 26, 2024, Escrow Issuer merged with and into CHSI, with CHSI continuing as the surviving entity, and CHSI assumed all of the Escrow Issuer s obligations under the senior notes. The Concentra senior notes are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by Concentra and certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Interest on the Concentra senior notes accrues at a rate of 6.875 per annum and is payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing on January 15, 2025. 
 Concentra IPO. On July 26, 2024, Concentra completed an IPO of 22,500,000 shares of its common stock, par value 0.01 per share, at an initial public offering price of 23.50 per share for net proceeds of 499.7 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commission of 29.1 million. In addition, the underwriters exercised the option to purchase an additional 750,000 shares of the Concentra s common stock for net proceeds of 16.7 million after deducting discounts and commission of 1.0 million. Concentra shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CON on July 25, 2024. After the closing of the IPO and underwriters option, Select owns 81.74 of the total outstanding shares of Concentra common stock, and continues to consolidate the financial results of Concentra. Select intends to make a distribution, which is intended to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, to its stockholders of all of its remaining equity interest in Concentra within twelve months of the IPO.

 Stock Repurchase Program. Holdings Board of Directors has authorized a common stock repurchase program to repurchase up to 1.0 billion worth of shares of its common stock. The common stock repurchase program will remain in effect until December 31, 2025, unless further extended or earlier terminated by the Board of Directors. Stock repurchases under this program may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, and at times and in such amounts as Holdings deems appropriate. Holdings funds this program with cash on hand and borrowings under its revolving facility. Holdings did not repurchase shares under the program during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Since the inception of the program through September 30, 2024, Holdings has repurchased 48,234,823 shares at a cost of approximately 600.3 million, or 12.45 per share, which includes transaction costs. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which enacted a 1 excise tax on stock repurchases that exceed 1.0 million, became effective January 1, 2023. 
 Use of Capital Resources. We may from time to time pursue opportunities to develop new joint venture relationships with large, regional health systems and other healthcare providers. We also intend to open new outpatient rehabilitation clinics and occupational health centers in local areas that we currently serve where we can benefit from existing referral relationships and brand awareness to produce incremental growth. In addition to our development activities, we may grow through opportunistic acquisitions. 
 Liquidity 
 We believe our internally generated cash flows and borrowing capacity under our revolving facility will allow us to finance our operations in both the short and long term. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 191.5 million and 883.0 million of availability under our revolving facilities after giving effect to 10.0 million of outstanding borrowings and 57.0 million of outstanding letters of credit. 
 We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, may be funded from operating cash flows or other sources and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. 
 Dividend 
 On February 13, 2024, May 1, 2024, and July 31, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of 0.125 per share. On March 13, 2024, May 30, 2024, and August 30, 2024, cash dividends totaling 16.0 million, 16.3 million, and 16.2 million were paid. 
 On October 30, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of 0.125 per share. The dividend will be payable on or about November 26, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 13, 2024. 
 There is no assurance that future dividends will be declared. The declaration and payment of dividends in the future are at the discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including, but not limited to, our financial condition, operating results, available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, the terms of our indebtedness, and other factors our Board of Directors may deem to be relevant. 
 Effects of Inflation 
 The healthcare industry is labor intensive and our largest expenses are labor related costs. Wage and other expenses increase during periods of inflation and when labor shortages occur in the marketplace. We have recently experienced higher labor costs related to an inflationary environment and competitive labor market. In addition, suppliers have passed along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices. We cannot predict our ability to pass along cost increases to our customers.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our variable rate long-term indebtedness. Our principal interest rate exposure relates to the loans outstanding under our Select and Concentra credit facilities, which bear interest rates that are indexed against Term SOFR. 
 At September 30, 2024, Select had outstanding borrowings under the Select Credit Facilities consisting of a 373.0 million term loan (excluding unamortized original issue discounts and debt issuance costs of 2.2 million) and 10.0 million of borrowings under its revolving facility, which bear interest at variable rates. 
 At September 30, 2024, Concentra had outstanding borrowings under the Concentra Credit Facilities consisting of a 850.0 million term loan (excluding unamortized original issue discounts and debt issuance costs of 13.0 million). Concentra had no outstanding borrowings under its revolving facility, which bear interest at variable rates. 
 As of September 30, 2024, each 0.25 increase in market interest rates will impact the annual interest expense on our variable rate debt by 3.1 million per year. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered in this report. Based on this evaluation, as of September 30, 2024, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, including the accumulation and communication of disclosure to our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure, are effective to provide reasonable assurance that material information required to be included in our periodic SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the relevant SEC rules and forms. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that occurred during the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there is only reasonable assurance that our controls will succeed in achieving their goals under all potential future conditions.
