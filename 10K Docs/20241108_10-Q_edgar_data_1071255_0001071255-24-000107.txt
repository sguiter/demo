 reportable segments: Nevada Casino Resorts, Nevada Locals Casinos and Nevada Taverns. 
 The Nevada Casino Resorts segment is comprised of destination casino resort properties offering a variety of food and beverage outlets, entertainment venues and other amenities. The casino resort properties in this segment cater primarily to a regional drive-in customer base seeking a value-oriented vacation experience, with guests typically traveling from Southern California or Arizona. The Company s casino resort properties in Nevada have a significantly larger number of hotel rooms compared to the other casino properties in its portfolio. While hotel stays at these casino resorts are typically longer, the overall frequency of visitation from guests is lower when compared to the Nevada Locals Casinos.

-mile radius of these properties. The Company s locals casino properties typically experience a higher frequency of customer visits compared to its casino resort properties, with many of the customers visiting the Company s Nevada Locals Casinos on a weekly basis. The casino properties within this reportable segment have no or a limited number of hotel rooms and offer fewer food and beverage outlets or other amenities, with revenues primarily generated from slot machine play. 
 The Nevada Taverns segment is comprised of branded tavern locations that offer a casual, upscale environment catering to local patrons offering superior food, craft beer and other alcoholic beverages and are typically limited to slot machines. Prior to the sale of the Company s distributed gaming operations in Nevada, the Company owned and operated the slot machines located within each tavern. Following the sale, slot machines at the Company s branded tavern locations are owned and operated by the independent third party that acquired the distributed gaming operations from the Company. 
 As discussed in Note 1 Nature of Business and Basis of Presentation , the Company completed the sales of Rocky Gap and its distributed gaming operations in Montana and Nevada on July 25, 2023, September 13, 2023 and January 10, 2024, respectively. Prior to its sale, the operations of Rocky Gap were presented in the Company s Maryland Casino Resort reportable segment. Prior to their sale, the results of the distributed gaming operations in Montana were combined with the results of the distributed gaming operations in Nevada and presented in the Company s Distributed Gaming reportable segment. 
 The Corporate and Other segment includes certain unallocated corporate overhead costs not easily allocable to reportable segments as to do so would not be practical. 
 The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA in its segment disclosures because it is the primary metric used by the Company s chief operating decision maker in measuring both the Company s past and future expectations of performance. Further, the Company s annual performance plan used to determine compensation of its executive officers and employees is tied to the Adjusted EBITDA metric. Adjusted EBITDA represents each segment s earnings before depreciation and amortization, non-cash lease expense, share-based compensation expense, gain or loss on disposal of assets and business, loss on debt extinguishment and modification, preopening and related expenses, interest, income taxes, and other non-cash charges that are deemed to be not indicative of the Company s core operating results, calculated before corporate overhead (which is not allocated to each reportable segment).

 Nevada Casino Resorts 
 Our Nevada Casino Resorts segment is comprised of destination casino resort properties offering a variety of food and beverage outlets, entertainment venues and other amenities. The casino resort properties in this segment cater primarily to a regional drive-in customer base seeking a value-oriented vacation experience, with guests typically traveling from Southern California or Arizona. Our casino resort properties in Nevada have a significantly larger number of hotel rooms compared to the other casino properties in our portfolio. While hotel stays at these casino resorts are typically longer, the overall frequency of visitation from guests is lower when compared to our Nevada Locals Casinos. 
 The STRAT : The STRAT is our premier casino resort property, located on Las Vegas Boulevard on the north end of the Las Vegas Strip. The STRAT is comprised of a casino, a hotel and a tower, which includes indoor and outdoor observation decks, thrill rides and the SkyJump attraction. The STRAT offers hotel rooms, gaming, race and sports book facilities in an 80,000 square foot casino, ten restaurants, two rooftop pools, a fitness center, retail shops and entertainment facilities. 
 Laughlin casinos : We own and operate two casino resorts in Laughlin, Nevada, the Aquarius and the Edgewater, which are located approximately 90 miles from Las Vegas on the western bank of the Colorado River. In addition to hotel rooms, gaming, race and sports book facilities at each property, the Aquarius has seven restaurants and the Edgewater offers five restaurants. The Edgewater also offers a bingo facility and dedicated entertainment venues, including the Edge Pavilion and the Laughlin Event Center. 
 The operations of Colorado Belle Casino Resort have remained suspended since March 2020 and we voluntarily surrendered our gaming license for the property on June 30, 2023. 
 Nevada Locals Casinos 
 Our Nevada Locals Casinos segment is comprised of casino properties that cater to local customers who generally live within a five-mile radius of our properties. Our locals casino properties typically experience a higher frequency of customer visits compared to our casino resort properties, with many of our customers visiting our Nevada Locals Casinos on a weekly basis. The casino properties within this reportable segment have no or a limited number of hotel rooms and offer fewer food and beverage outlets or other amenities, with revenues primarily generated from slot machine play. 
 22 

Arizona Charlie s casinos : Our Arizona Charlie s Boulder and Arizona Charlie s Decatur casino properties primarily serve local Las Vegas gaming patrons, and provide an alternative experience to the Las Vegas Strip. In addition to hotel rooms, gaming, race and sports book facilities and bingo facilities , Arizona Charlie s Boulder offer s three restaurants and an RV park with 221 RV hook-up sites and Arizona Charlie s Decatur offers four restaurants. 
 Pahrump casinos : We own and operate three casino properties in Pahrump, Nevada, which is located approximately 60 miles from Las Vegas and is a gateway to Death Valley National Park. In addition to gaming and race and sports book facilities at each of our Pahrump casino properties, the Pahrump Nugget offers hotel rooms, four restaurants, bingo, a bowling center, and a 5,200 square foot banquet and event center. Our Lakeside Casino RV Park also offers a bingo facility, a restaurant and 159 RV hook-up sites. 
 Nevada Taverns 
 Our Nevada Taverns segment is comprised of branded tavern locations that offer a casual, upscale environment catering to local patrons offering superior food, craft beer and other alcoholic beverages, and are typically limited to 15 slot machines. Most of our branded taverns are located in the greater Las Vegas, Nevada metropolitan area and cater to local patrons seeking more convenient entertainment establishments than traditional casino properties. Our tavern patrons are typically younger than traditional casino customers, which diversifies our customer demographic. Prior to the sale of our distributed gaming operations in Nevada, we owned and operated the slot machines located within each tavern. Following the sale, slot machines at our branded tavern locations are owned and operated by the independent third party that acquired the distributed gaming operations from us. Accordingly, Golden typically receives a large percentage of the gaming revenue from the tavern slot machines in exchange for allowing the independent third party that acquired the distributed gaming operations to place the slot machines in our taverns. Our tavern brands include PT s Pub, PT s Gold, PT s Ranch, PT s Place, Sean Patrick s, Sierra Gold, SG Bar, Sierra Junction, Lucky s and Great American Pub. As of September 30, 2024, we owned and operated 72 branded taverns, which offered over 1,100 onsite slot machines.

Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and condensed notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Revenues Gaming 75,684 165,177 240,880 535,619 Food and beverage 41,849 44,507 128,623 137,312 Rooms 28,938 31,417 89,760 92,912 Other 14,762 16,625 43,351 56,615 Total revenues 161,233 257,726 502,614 822,458 Expenses Gaming 20,141 94,820 67,796 307,126 Food and beverage 34,226 33,576 102,702 101,243 Rooms 16,202 15,978 48,888 46,118 Other 4,276 5,487 11,140 17,222 Selling, general and administrative 57,056 67,727 173,130 196,856 Depreciation and amortization 22,626 22,213 67,362 67,175 Gain on disposal of assets (256) (5) (242) (125) Gain on sale of business (305,829) (68,944) (305,829) Preopening expenses 234 50 377 575 Total expenses (income) 154,505 (65,983) 402,209 430,361 Operating income 6,728 323,709 100,405 392,097 Non-operating expense Interest expense, net (7,959) (15,306) (27,255) (52,345) Loss on debt extinguishment and modification (4,446) (405) Total non-operating expense, net (7,959) (15,306) (31,701) (52,750) (Loss) income before income tax benefit (provision) (1,231) 308,403 68,704 339,347 Income tax benefit (provision) 6,398 (67,187) (20,951) (74,219) Net income 5,167 241,216 47,753 265,128 
 
 Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenues 
 The 96.5 million, or 37 , decrease in rev enues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period resulted from decreases of 89.5 million, 2.7 million, 2.5 million and 1.8 million in gaming, food and beverage, rooms, and other revenues, respectively. The decrease in gaming revenues was primarily attributable to the exclusion of the results of Rocky Gap and our distributed gaming operations in Montana and Nevada from their respective dates of sale on July 25, 2023, September 13, 2023 and January 10, 2024, respectively. The decrease in food and beverage revenues was primarily driven by the exclusion of the results of Rocky Gap and a strategic decision to reduce the number of entertainment offerings at our Laughlin Event Center, which resulted in decreased visitation at our Laughlin properties during the current year period. We also experienced lower occupancy rates at our Nevada Casino Resorts during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period, which resulted in lower food and beverage, rooms, and other revenues. 
 The 319.8 million, or 39 , decrease in revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period resulted from decreases of 294.7 million, 8.7 million, 3.1 million, and 13.3 million in gaming, food and beverage, rooms, and other revenues, respectively . The decrease in revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year was driven by the year-over-year trends observed for the three months ended September 30, 2024 discussed above. 
 
 24 

Operating Expenses 
 The 75.0 million , or 50 , decrease in operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period related to decreases of 74.7 million and 1.2 million in gaming and other operating expenses, respectively, partially offset by the increases of 0.7 million and 0.2 million in food and beverage and rooms operating expenses, respectively. The decrease in gaming operating expenses was primarily attributable to the exclusion of the results of Rocky Gap and our distributed gaming operations in Montana and Nevada following their respective dates of sale. The decrease in other operating expenses was driven primarily by a decrease in costs related to entertainment at our Laughlin Event Center. The increase in food and beverage operating expenses was primarily attributable to the addition of seven branded taverns since the prior year period. Rooms operating expenses increased due to the higher labor costs incurred at The STRAT during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. 
 The 241.2 million , or 51 , decrease in op erating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period resulted f rom decreases of 239.3 million and 6.1 million in gaming and other expenses, respectively. The decrease was partially offset by increases of 1.5 million and 2.7 million in food and beverage and rooms operating expenses, respectively. The changes in operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period were primarily driven by the year-over-year trends observed for the three months ended September 30, 2024 discussed above. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 The 10.7 million, or 16 , decrease in selling, general and administrative SG A expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period was primarily attributable to the exclusion of the results of Rocky Gap and our distributed gaming operations in Montana and Nevada following their respective dates of sale. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in costs related to insurance and related reserves, utilities, legal, vendor fees, and maintenance contract fees. 
 The 23.7 million, or 12 , decrease in SG A expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period was primarily driven by the year-over-year trends observed for the three months ended September 30, 2024 discussed above. 
 SG A expenses are comprised of marketing and advertising, utilities, building rent, maintenance contracts, corporate office overhead, information technology, legal, accounting, third-party service providers, executive compensation, share-based compensation, payroll expenses and payroll taxes. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 The increase in depreciation and amortization expenses of 0.4 million, or 2 , and 0.2 million, or 0.3 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior year periods was primarily related to the addition of four Lucky s locations in November 2023 and two GAP locations in April 2024 and depreciation of new assets placed in service upon completion of the room remodels at The STRAT. 
 Gain on Disposal of Assets 
 Gain on disposal of assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by disposal of certain assets in our Nevada Locals Casinos segment. Gain on disposal of assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by sales of used gaming equipment in our Distributed Gaming segment. 
 Gain on Sale of Business 
 There was no gain on sale of business for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The 68.9 million gain on sale of business for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the sale of our distributed gaming operations in Nevada on January 10, 2024. 
 Preopening Expenses 
 Preopening expenses consist of labor, food, utilities, training, initial licensing, rent and organizational costs incurred in connection with the opening of branded tavern and casino locations as well as food and beverage and other venues within our casino locations. Preopening expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were related to our new branded tavern openings within our Nevada Taverns segment. 
 Non-Operating Expense, Net 
 The decrease in non-operating expense, net of 7.3 million, or 48 , and 21.0 million , or 40 , for the three and nine months 
 25 

ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior year periods was primarily related to the decrease in interest expense, net of interest income, in the amount of 7.3 million and 25.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively. The decrease in interest expense, net was primarily attributable to the reduction in the amount of debt obligations outstanding and higher interest income generated during the current year period. The interest expense reduction was partially offset by the 4.0 million increase in loss on debt extinguishment and modification primarily due to the write-off of debt issuance costs and discount as a result of the redemption of all of our 7.625 Senior Notes due 2026 2026 Unsecured Notes on April 15, 2024. Refer to Note 6 Long-Term Debt in Part I, Item 1: Financial Statements for further information. 
 Income Taxes 
 The effective income tax rates were 519.7 and 30.5 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 differed from the federal income tax rate of 21 primarily due to the benefit recorded from the reduction of our uncertain tax positions UTP payable. The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 differed from the federal income tax rate of 21 primarily due to the tax effect of the sale of our distributed gaming operations in Nevada and the benefit recorded from the reduction of our UTP. The effective income tax rates were 21.8 and 21.9 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, which differed from the federal tax rate of 21 primarily due to the limitation on tax deductions for executive compensation in excess of 1 million under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
 
 Revenues and Adjusted EBITDA by Reportable Segment 
 To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ), we use Adjusted EBITDA because it is the primary metric used by our chief operating decision maker and investors in measuring both our past and future expectations of performance. Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to the users of our financial statements by excluding specific expenses and gains that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results. Furthermore, our annual performance plan used to determine compensation for our executive officers and employees is tied to the Adjusted EBITDA metric. It is also a measure of operating performance widely used in the gaming industry. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do. 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before depreciation and amortization, non-cash lease expenses, shared-based compensation expense, gain or loss on disposal of assets and business, loss on debt extinguishment and modification, preopening and related expenses, interest, income taxes, and other non-cash charges that are deemed to be not indicative of our core operating results, calculated before corporate overhead (which is not allocated to each reportable segment).

 Revenues decreased by 6.0 million, or 6 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily due to decreases of 1.7 million, 1.6 million, 1.4 million and 1.3 million in gaming, food and beverage, rooms and other revenues, respectively. The decrease in revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by lower visitation to our Nevada Casino Resorts in part related to the strategic decision to reduce the number of entertainment offerings at our Laughlin Event Center. 
 Revenues decreased by 6.6 million, or 2 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily due to decreases of 4.0 million, 2.0 million, and 2.4 million in gaming, food and beverage, and other revenues, respectively, offset by 1.8 million increase in rooms revenues. The decreases in the current year period were primarily driven by the year-over-year trends observed for the three months ended September 30, 2024 discussed above. 
 27 

Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 6.2 million, or 20 , and 11.7 million, or 13 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to prior year periods primarily due to higher labor costs incurred at The STRAT during the current year and the reduction in revenues compared to the prior year period. 
 Nevada Locals Casinos 
 Revenues decreased by 2.5 million, or 7 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily due to a decrease of 2.0 million, 0.1 million and 0.4 million in gaming, food and beverage, and rooms revenues, respectively. The decrease in gaming revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to lower slot and bingo revenues at certain of our Nevada Locals Casinos due to lower visitation from our rated players, which also impacted our food and beverage and rooms revenues. 
 Revenues decreased by 6.7 million , or 6 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily due to decreases of 6.4 million and 0.7 million in gaming and rooms revenues, respectively, offset by increases of 0.2 million each in food and beverage and other revenues. The changes in gaming and r ooms revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily driven by lower visitation from our rated players, with food and beverage and other revenues relatively flat year-over-year. 
 Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 2.6 million, or 15 , and 7.8 million, or 14 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to prior year periods, primarily due to higher labor costs during the current year periods and the reduction in revenues compared to the prior year periods. 
 Nevada Taverns 
 Revenues decreased by 0.5 million, or 2 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily due to decreases of 1.2 million and 0.1 million in gaming and food and beverage revenues, respectively, offset by a increase of 0.8 million in other revenues. Our Nevada Taverns experienced lower visitation during the current year period, which impacted our gaming and food and beverages revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Other revenue increased compared to the prior year period due to certain of our taverns operating under a space lease arrangement where we receive a fixed monthly rental fee. 
 Revenues increased by 0.5 million, or 1 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increase of 2.8 million in other revenues, partially offset by decreases of 0.8 million and 1.5 million in gaming and food and beverage revenues, respectively. The changes were primarily driven by the year-over-year trends observed for the three months ended September 30, 2024 discussed above. 
 Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 2.2 million, or 29 , and 3.8 million, or 16 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior year periods primarily due to higher labor costs and cost of goods in the current year periods. 
 Distributed Gaming 
 This reportable segment was comprised of our distributed gaming operations in Montana and Nevada, which were sold on September 13, 2023 and January 10, 2024, respectively. Refer to Note 1 Nature of Business and Basis of Presentation and Note 2 Divestitures in Part I, Item 1: Financial Statements for further information. The decreases in revenues and Adjusted EBITDA compared to the prior year periods reflected the exclusion of results from our distributed gaming operations in Montana and Nevada following their respective dates of sale. 
 Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of segment revenues (or Adjusted EBITDA margin) was 25 , 40 and 20 for Nevada Casino Resorts, Nevada Locals Casinos and Nevada Taverns segments, respectively, compared to Adjusted EBITDA margins of 29 , 45 and 28 , respectively, for the prior year period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Adjusted EBITDA margins were 26 , 43 and 25 for Nevada Casino Resorts, Nevada Locals Casinos and Nevada Taverns segments, respectively, compared to Adjusted EBITDA margins of 29 , 47 and 30 , respectively, for the prior year period. 
 The lower Adjusted EBITDA margins for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily attributable to increases in labor costs and cost of goods and the reduction in revenues compared to the prior year periods.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 68.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and borrowing availability under our 240 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements during the next 12 months. As of September 30, 2024, we had borrowing availability of 240 million under our Revolving Credit Facility (refer to Note 6 Long-Term Debt in Part I, Item 1: Financial Statements for additional information regarding our Revolving Credit Facility). As discussed above, on January 10, 2024, we sold our distributed gaming operations in Nevada for aggregate cash consideration of 213.5 million plus working capital and other adjustments and net of cash transferred at closing. In addition, commencing in February 2024, our Board has declared a recurring quarterly cash dividend of 0.25 per share of our common stock, the first of which was paid on April 4, 2024. Refer to Note 7 Shareholders Equity and Stock Incentive Plans in Part I, Item 1: Financial Statements for further discussion on dividends. 
 During the second quarter of 2024, we reduced our long-term debt obligations by redeeming in full all of our 2026 Unsecured Notes, and we modified the terms of our senior secured credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the Credit Facility to reduce the interest rate margins applicable to term loan borrowings under the Credit Facility. The transactions improved our net leverage and are expected to have a positive impact on our ability to access capital resources in the future. Refer to Note 6 Long-Term Debt in Part I, Item 1: Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Our operating results and performance depend significantly on national, regional and local economic conditions and their effect on consumer spending. Declines in consumer spending would cause revenues generated by our operations to be adversely affected. 
 To further enhance our liquidity position or to finance any future acquisition or other business investment initiatives, we may obtain additional financing, which could consist of debt, convertible debt or equity financing from public and/or private credit and capital markets. 
 Cash Flows 
 Net cash provided by operating activities w as 69.8 million and 128.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 58.5 million, or 46 , decrease in operating cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period was primarily related to a decrease in operating income as a result of divestitures of Rocky Gap and our distributed gaming operations in Montana and Nevada and the timing of working capital spending. 
 Net cash provided by investing activities of 155.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to the cash receipts of 204.1 million from the sale of our distributed gaming operations in Nevada in January 2024, offset by 41.7 million spent on capital expenditures, primarily at The STRAT, and 7.3 million spent on the acquisition of GAP. Net cash provided by investing activities of 293.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily related to the cash receipts of 365.0 million from the sale of Rocky Gap in July 2023 and our distributed gaming operations in Montana in September 2023, offset by 71.7 million spent on capital expenditures, primarily at The STRAT. 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 354.0 million and 268.1 million f or the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 85.9 million, or 32 , increase in net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily related to a 276.5 million payment to redeem and repay in full our 2026 Unsecured Notes and a 45.5 million year-over-year increase in the aggregate amount paid for the repurchases of our common stock under our share repurchase program. The increase in net cash used in financing activities was partially offset by a 8.5 million reduction in the amount paid for tax withholdings on option exercises and the vesting of time-based restricted stock units RSUs ), and a 8.0 million reduction in fees paid for debt extinguishment and modification costs during the current year period, as well as a 3.2 million increase in proceeds from stock option exercises. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we made a 175 million prepayment under our Credit Facility using a portion of the proceeds from the sale of Rocky Gap and paid a one-time cash dividend of 2.00 per share of the outstanding common stock in the aggregate amount of 57.7 million. 
 Long-Term Debt 
 Refer to Note 6 Long-Term Debt in Part I, Item 1: Financial Statements for discussion of our debt instruments. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 Share repurchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions, block trades, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan or in private transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws and regulations and other legal requirements, including compliance with our finance agreements. There is no minimum number of shares that we are required to repurchase and the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. Refer to Note 7 Shareholders 
 29 

Equity and Stock Incentive Plans in Part I, Item 1: Financial Statements for additional information regarding our share repurchase program and common stock purchases made pursuant to our share repurchase program. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 1,804,233 shares of our common stock at an average price of 30.67 per share for a total purchase price of 55.4 million. Subsequent to quarter end, we repurchased an additional 134,613 shares of our common stock at an average price of 31.19 per share for a total purchase price of 4.2 million under our Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. 
 
 Other Items Affecting Liquidity 
 The outcome of the following specific matters, including our commitments and contingencies, may also affect our liquidity. 
 Commitments, Capital Spending and Development 
 We perform on-going refurbishment and maintenance at our facilities, of which certain maintenance costs are capitalized if such improvement or refurbishment extends the life of the related asset, while other maintenance costs that do not so qualify are expensed as incurred. The commitment of capital and the related timing thereof are contingent upon, among other things, negotiation of final agreements and receipt of approvals from the appropriate regulatory bodies. We intend to fund such capital expenditures through our operating cash flows and Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Refer to Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies in Part I, Item 1: Financial Statements for additional information regarding commitments and contingencies that may also affect our liquidity. 
 Other Opportunities 
 We may investigate and pursue expansion opportunities in our existing or new markets from time to time. Such expansions will be influenced and determined by a number of factors, which may include licensing availability and approval, suitable investment opportunities and availability of acceptable financing. Investigation and pursuit of such opportunities may require us to make substantial investments or incur substantial costs, which we may fund through cash flows from operations or borrowing availability under our Revolving Credit Facility. To the extent such sources of funds are not sufficient, we may also seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings or from other sources. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that, if available, such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to us. Moreover, we can provide no assurances that the investigation or pursuit of an opportunity will result in a completed transaction. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Management s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to the application of the acquisition method of accounting, long-lived assets, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, revenue recognition, income taxes and share-based compensation expenses. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable, based upon information presently available; however, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 A description of our critical accounting estimates can be found under Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report. For a more extensive discussion of our accounting policies, refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplemental Data in our Annual Report. There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Seasonality 
 We believe that our businesses are affected by seasonal factors, including holidays, weather and travel conditions. Our casino properties and branded taverns in Nevada have historically experienced lower revenues during the summer as a result of fewer tourists due to higher temperatures, as well as increased vacation activity by local residents. Our branded taverns typically experience higher revenues during the fall which corresponds with several professional sports seasons. While other factors like unemployment levels and market competition may either offset or magnify seasonal effects, some seasonality is likely to continue, which could result in significant fluctuation in our quarterly operating results. 
 30 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 1 Nature of Business and Basis of Presentation in Part I, Item 1: Financial Statements for information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements. 
 
 Regulation and Taxes 
 Our business is subject to extensive regulation by state gaming authorities. Changes in applicable laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 The gaming industry represents a significant source of tax revenues to regulators. From time to time, various federal and state legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax law, or in the administration of such law, affecting the gaming industry. It is not possible to determine the likelihood of possible changes in tax law or in the administration of such law. Such changes, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. 
 
 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have no off balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our variable rate long-term debt. As of September 30, 2024, our variable rate long-term debt primarily comprised our indebtedness under the Credit Facility (refer to Note 6 Long-Term Debt in Part I, Item 1: Financial Statements). 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 395 million in principal amount of outstanding term loan borrowings under the Credit Facility with no outstanding borrowings under our 240 million Revolving Credit Facility (defined in Note 6 Long-Term Debt in Part I, Item 1: Financial Statements). Our primary interest rate under the Credit Facility is the SOFR rate plus an applicable margin. The weighted-average effective interest rate on our outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility was 7.56 and 7.90 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Assuming the outstanding balance under our Credit Facility remained constant over a year, a 50 basis point increase in the applicable interest rate would increase interest incurred, prior to effects of capitalized interest, by 2.0 million over a twelve-month period. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 68.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the objective that information in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified and pursuant to the requirements of the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), we carried out an evaluation , with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, which factors could materially affect our business, financial condition, liquidity or future results. There have been no material changes to the risk factors described in the Risk Factors section in our Annual Report. The risks described in our Annual Report are not the only risks facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, prospects or stock price. 
 
 ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 Issuer Purchase of Equity 
 From time to time, we repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our 100 million share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors on July 27, 2023. Share repurchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions, through block trades, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan or in private transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws and regulations and other legal requirements, including compliance with our finance agreements. Share repurchases may be made at management s discretion based on market conditions and financial resources and there is no minimum number of shares that we are required to repurchase. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. 
 The following table presents our common stock repurchases for the three months ended September 30, 2024: 
 Total Number of Shares Purchased (1) (2) 
 Average Price per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of a Publicly Announced Program Approximate Dollar Value That May Yet Be Purchased Under the Program

As discussed in Note 7 Shareholders Equity and Stock Incentive Plans and Note 13 Subsequent Events in Part I, Item 1: Financial Statements, on November 5, 2024, our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase authorization by 100.0 million, creating 131.4 million of availability under our share repurchase program. 
 
 ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION 
 Our directors and officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f)) did not or any Rule 10b5-1 trading plans or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements (as such terms are defined in Item 408(c) of Regulation S-K) during the three months ended September 30, 2024.
