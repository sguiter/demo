The 2021 Senior Notes and the 2023 Senior Notes are collectively the Senior Notes . We, along with CLIH, have a credit facility, the Eighth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the Credit Facility for an aggregate borrowing commitment of million with a million accordion feature. The Credit Facility is secured by first priority interests in (1) substantially all of the tangible and intangible personal property, and equity interest of CLIH and certain of the Company s U.S. and foreign subsidiary companies; and (2) instruments evidencing intercompany indebtedness owing to the Company, CLIH and certain of the Company s U.S. and foreign subsidiary companies.

Any outstanding balance under the Credit Facility is due at maturity on , subject to springing maturity on July 12, 2025, if any portion of the Company s 2021 Senior Notes Series A due January 12, 2026, in the aggregate principal amount of million, remain outstanding on July 12, 2025, unless the Company s liquidity equals or exceeds the principal amount of the 2021 Senior Notes Series A outstanding on such date. The available capacity at any point in time is reduced by outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit which totaled approximately million at September 30, 2024 , resulting in an available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility of approximately million. In addition to indebtedness under the Credit Facility, we had approximately million of outstanding letters of credit and performance guarantees and bonds from other sources as of September 30, 2024.

At September 30, 2023 , the outstanding balance on our Credit Facility had been reduced to , and approximately million of losses were reclassified to interest expense associated with the ineffective period of the hedging relationship, as it became probable that certain of the forecasted transactions would not occur within the originally specified time period.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 On May 1, 2023, Core Laboratories N.V. completed its previously announced redomestication transaction (the Redomestication Transaction ), which, through a series of steps, resulted in the merger of Core Laboratories N.V., a holding company in the Netherlands, with and into Core Laboratories Luxembourg S.A., a public limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg, with Core Laboratories Luxembourg S.A. surviving, and subsequently the migration of Core Laboratories Luxembourg S.A. out of Luxembourg and its domestication as Core Laboratories Inc., a Delaware corporation. The Redomestication Transaction has been accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control. There is no difference between the combined separate entities prior to the Redomestication Transaction and the combined separate entities after the Redomestication Transaction, therefore, comparative information reported below does not differ from amounts previously reported under Core Laboratories N.V. s consolidated financial statements. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Core Laboratories Inc. s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, Core Laboratories N.V. s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and Core Laboratories N.V. s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, including Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . 
 The following discussion highlights the current operating environment and summarizes the financial position of Core Laboratories Inc. and its subsidiaries as of September 30, 2024, and should be read in conjunction with the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q Quarterly Report ).

For a more detailed discussion of some of the foregoing risks and uncertainties, see Part II, Item 1A - Risk Factors of this Quarterly Report and Item 1A - Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). 
 Outlook 
 Currently, global oil inventories are low relative to historical levels, and with continued supply restrictions from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC+ ), global supply is expected to be managed and maintained at a level to meet forecasted growth in oil demand for the next few years. During the last couple of years, OPEC+ and its key member, Saudi Arabia, announced several mandatory and voluntary reductions in production that are expected to remain in place through November 2024, after which, the cuts will be phased out on a monthly basis as scheduled starting December 1, 2024, stretching to November 2025, with the flexibility to pause or reverse the adjustments as necessary. 
 The current global demand for crude oil and natural gas remains at a high level and according to the latest International Energy Agency s report, global demand is expected to continue increasing in 2024, 2025 and beyond. As a result, it is anticipated that crude-oil commodity prices for the near-term will remain at current levels or increase if projections for demand remain accurate or disruptions to supply occur. In 2023, capital spending towards the exploration of crude oil and natural gas reached its highest level in over a decade with modest growth in 2024 and additional growth expected in 2025. Therefore, our clients' activities associated with the appraisal, development and production of crude oil and natural gas are also expected to remain at current levels or increase for the remainder of 2024. Outside the U.S., international oil and gas projects continue to build and are expected to grow and accelerate into the next several years. U.S. onshore drilling and completion activities are expected to remain at current levels with some typical seasonal decrease towards the end of the year. 
 The ongoing geopolitical conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East continue to cause disruptions to traditional maritime supply chains and the trading of crude oil and derived products, such as diesel fuel. The maritime supply chains associated with the movement of crude oil have continued to realign and stabilize throughout 2023 and in 2024, which has reduced some of the volatility in crude-oil prices and disruptions to our operations. Core Lab expects crude-oil supply lines 
 22 Return to Index 

to remain more stable, and the Company's volume of associated laboratory services to be commensurate with the trading and movement of crude-oil into Europe, the Middle East, Asia and across the globe. The United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and other countries continue to expand sanctions, export controls and other measures against Russia, Belarus, Iran and other countries, officials, individuals or industries in the respective territories, which may have further impact on the trading and movement of crude oil and derived products. We have no way to predict the progress or outcome of these events, and any resulting government responses are fluid and beyond our control. 
 We continue to focus on large-scale core analyses and reservoir fluids characterization studies in most oil-producing regions across the globe, which include both newly developed fields and brownfield extensions in many offshore developments in both the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S. we are involved in projects with many of the onshore unconventional basins and offshore projects in the Gulf of Mexico. Outside the U.S. we continue to work on many smaller and large-scale projects analyzing crude oil and derived products in every major producing region of the world. Notable larger projects are in locations such as Guyana and Suriname, located offshore South America, Australia, Southern Namibia and the Middle East. Analysis and measurement of crude oil derived products also occurs in every major producing region of the world. Additionally, some of our major clients have increased their investment in projects to capture and sequester carbon dioxide CO2 ). The Company s activities on these projects have expanded and are expected to continue expanding in 2024 and beyond. 
 Additionally, on March 6, 2024, the SEC finalized rules to require certain climate-related disclosures in filings for public companies, beginning for fiscal year 2025 for large accelerated filers. However, the rule has been subject to consolidated legal challenges in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and the SEC has announced that it will not implement the rule while litigation is pending. While we are still assessing the rule s potential impact on us, if the rule takes effect, we will be required to comply.

Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2024 and for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Service Revenue 
 Service revenue is primarily tied to activities associated with the exploration, appraisal, development, and production of oil, gas and derived products outside the U.S. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, service revenue was 98.8 million, an increase of 6 year-over-year and 3 sequentially. Year-over-year, the increase was due to growth in activity levels in both international and U.S. markets. Activity on reservoir rock and fluid projects continues to expand and reservoir fluid analysis services in several international regions showed improvement when compared to the prior year. Additionally, well completion diagnostic services in the U.S. market showed strong growth in 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. The growth in revenue continues to be negatively impacted by the on-going geopolitical conflicts previously discussed and delays of well diagnostic projects in the Gulf of Mexico caused by multiple hurricanes during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 26 Return to Index 

Sequentially, the increase in service revenue was primarily driven by growth in international reservoir rock projects and fluid analysis services, offset by delays in projects associated with well completion diagnostic services in the U.S. impacted by multiple hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico during the current quarter. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, service revenue was 291.7 million, an increase of 5 compared to the same period in the prior year, driven by increases in both international and U.S. activity, as well as strong growth in well completion diagnostic services in the U.S., as discussed above. 
 Product Sales Revenue 
 Product sales are primarily tied to supporting the U.S. onshore drilling and completion activities and bulk product sales to international markets. Product sales to international markets are typically sold and shipped in bulk and revenue can vary from one quarter to another. The average U.S. land rig count for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 10 lower when compared to the same period in 2023, U.S. onshore drilling and completion activities continue to decline during the three months ended September 30, 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, product sales revenue of 35.6 million increased 10 year-over-year and 4 sequentially. The year-over-year growth in product sales was driven primarily by a larger volume of bulk shipments to international markets partially offset by lower level of product sales in the U.S. onshore market during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Sequentially, the increase was due to a higher level of bulk shipments in the international market offset by a lower level of product sales in the U.S. onshore market. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, product sales revenue was 102.9 million, and decreased 1 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to decreased sales in the U.S. onshore market as discussed above. 
 Cost of Services, excluding depreciation 
 Cost of services was 75.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 9 year-over-year and 1 sequentially. Cost of services expressed as a percentage of service revenue was 76 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 74 for the same period in the prior year, and 78 compared to the prior quarter. Year-over-year, the increase in cost of services as a percentage of service revenue was primarily associated with higher employee compensation and higher operating costs as a result of additional costs incurred due to the fire incident at one of our U.K. facilities. The additional costs and loss of income from business interruption were substantially covered by insurance proceeds recorded in Other (income) expense, net . 
 Sequentially, the improvement in cost of services as a percentage of services revenue was primarily due to the improved utilization of our global laboratory network with a higher revenue base and a slightly different mix of services provided in the three months ended September 30, 2024, versus the prior quarter. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cost of services was 224.2 million, an increase of 6 compared to the same period in the prior year. Cost of services expressed as a percentage of service revenue remained relatively flat compared to the same period in the prior year. Although utilization of our global laboratory network has improved with higher revenue, these efficiency gains have been offset by the impact of higher employee compensation and operating costs as discussed above. 
 Cost of Product Sales, excluding depreciation 
 Cost of product sales was 31.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 13 year-over-year and 11 sequentially. Cost of product sales expressed as a percentage of product sales revenue was 88 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 85 year-over-year and 82 sequentially. The year-over-year increase in cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales was primarily due to a decrease in manufacturing efficiencies and absorption of fixed costs as product sales have decreased in the U.S. market. 
 27 Return to Index 

Sequentially, the increase in cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales was primarily due to the decrease in manufacturing efficiencies as discussed above. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cost of product sales was 90.1 million, an increase of 3 compared to the same period in the prior year. Cost of product sales expressed as a percentage of product sales revenue was 88 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 84 for the same period in the prior year. The increase in cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales revenue was primarily due to lower levels of product sales in the U.S., which resulted in higher absorption of fixed costs on a lower revenue base and other factors as discussed above. 
 General and Administrative Expense, excluding depreciation 
 General and administrative G A expense includes corporate management and centralized administrative services that benefit our operations. 
 G A expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 8.6 million, which decreased 0.8 million compared to the same period in 2023. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a 1.9 million reversal of stock compensation expense previously recognized, as the performance targets levels were determined to be unachievable for certain awards vesting in 2024. The decrease in this compensation cost was partially offset by implementation costs of a global human capital management system and a third-party assessment of the Company s IT cybersecurity environment initiated in 2024. 
 G A expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, of 8.6 million decreased 1.6 million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. The sequential decrease of 1.6 million in G A expense was primarily due to the reversal of stock compensation expense discussed above partially offset by changes in other employee compensation costs. 
 G A expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 30.7 million and decreased 0.9 million compared to 31.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower stock compensation expense offset by higher levels of expense for system implementation costs and cybersecurity assessments in 2024 as discussed above. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
 Depreciation and amortization expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 3.7 million, a decrease of 6 year-over-year and 2 sequentially. Depreciation and amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 11.3 million, a decrease of 5 year-over-year. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense compared to the prior year periods and sequentially is primarily due to assets which became fully depreciated and lower levels of capital expenditures.

Interest Expense 
 Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.1 million relatively flat year-over-year and down 3 compared to the prior quarter. The Company retired 75.0 million of senior notes on September 30, 2023, which carried a fixed interest rate of 4.11 . These senior notes were partially refinanced with 50 million of new senior notes which carry fixed interest rates of 7.25 and 7.50 . Although the total debt of the Company has been reduced, the current debt carries a higher blended interest rate. Sequentially, the decrease was primarily due to lower average borrowings on our bank revolving credit facility during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 9.7 million compared to 9.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the changes in borrowings and the associated interest rates, as discussed above. 
 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 
 The Company recorded an income tax expense of 4.7 million and 10.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to an income tax expense of 2.3 million and an income tax benefit of 4.3 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 28.1 and 28.8 , respectively. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 20.0 and (14.4 ), respectively. The tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was impacted by the earnings mix of jurisdictions subject to tax for the period and items discrete to the quarter. The tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was largely impacted by the reversal of net deferred tax liabilities attributable to Core Laboratories N.V., which were not realized following the Redomestication Transaction on May 1, 2023. 
 Segment Analysis

Reservoir Description 
 Reservoir Description operations are closely correlated with trends in international and offshore activity levels, with approximately 80 of its revenue sourced from existing producing fields, development projects and movement of crude oil products outside the U.S. 
 Revenue from the Reservoir Description operating segment of 88.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 4 year-over-year and 3 sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to growth in reservoir rock and fluid analysis projects in the international market and higher demand for crude-assay analysis services in certain regions. These increases continue to be negatively impacted by the on-going geopolitical conflicts previously discussed and delays in fluids analysis projects caused by the hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico during the current quarter. 
 Sequentially, the increase in revenue is associated with a slightly elevated level of activity in reservoir rock and fluid analysis for international projects, as well as increased revenue associated with crude-assay analysis services. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of laboratory equipment and delays in fluids analysis projects caused by the hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico during the current quarter. 
 Revenue from the Reservoir Description segment of 259.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 4 from the same period in 2023. The increase in revenue during 2024 is primarily due to growth in activity levels on international projects for reservoir rock and fluid analysis services, particularly the Middle East and Asia Pacific, and improvement in the level of some crude-assay analysis services in the Europe and Africa regions. The growth in revenue was partially offset by delayed project revenue caused by the fire incident at one of our U.K. facilities as discussed above. The Company holds insurance policies for both property damage and business interruption, which has minimized the loss to the Company associated with the fire. 
 Operating income of 16.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased 3.5 million, year-over-year and 5.0 million sequentially. Operating margins were 19 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 15 year-over-year, and 13 sequentially. Year-over-year, the increase in operating income and operating margins was primarily attributable to the improved utilization of our global laboratory network with higher revenue base, and some insurance proceeds received in the current quarter to recover losses previously absorbed from the fire in the Aberdeen facility. These improvements were partially offset by higher employee compensation and operating expenses. Sequentially, the increase in operating income and operating margins was primarily due to 1) incremental revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024; 2) gain on insurance recovery of losses absorbed in previous quarters from the fire, and 3) a lower level of Corporate G A expenses absorbed in the segment. See discussion of General and Administrative Expense , above. Operating income of 34.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 6.0 million year-over-year compared to the same period in 2023. Operating margins were 13 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a slight increase compared to 12 in the same 
 31 Return to Index 

period in prior year. The increase in operating income is primarily driven by incremental revenue of 10.6 million year-over-year. 
 Production Enhancement 
 Production Enhancement operations are largely focused on complex completions in unconventional oil and gas reservoirs in the U.S. as well as conventional projects across the globe. U.S. onshore drilling and completion activities typically experience a seasonal decline at end of the year with activity levels increasing at the beginning of the year. Average rig count in the U.S. land market for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was down by 10 year-over-year and 3 sequentially. International rig count remained flat year-over-year and decreased 3 sequentially. 
 Revenue from the Production Enhancement operating segment of 45.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased 13 year-over-year and 3 sequentially. Year-over-year, there was strong growth in well completion diagnostic services coupled with a higher level of bulk sales in the international markets. Sequentially, increased product sales to international market substantially offset by a decline in the U.S land completion activity and delayed well completion diagnostic projects in the Gulf of Mexico caused by hurricanes during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Revenue from the Production Enhancement segment of 135.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 2 from the same period in 2023. The increased revenue in 2024 was primarily driven by strong growth in well completion diagnostic services in the U.S. markets substantially offset by lower activity and product sales into the U.S. onshore market. 
 Operating income of 3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased 1.7 million year-over-year, and decreased 1.2 million sequentially. Operating margins for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were 7 , compared to operating margins of 4 year-over-year and 10 sequentially. Year-over-year, the increase in operating income and margins was primarily driven by a higher level of service revenue that contributed to higher margins in 2024 compared to 2023, and a lower level of corporate G A expenses absorbed by the segment. Sequentially, the decrease in operating income and margins was primarily due to delayed well diagnostic projects with high decremental margins caused by the hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico during the three months ended September 30, 2024 although a lower level of corporate G A expenses was absorbed by the segment. 
 Operating income of 9.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 1.1 million compared to the same period in the prior year. Operating margins were 7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a slight decrease compared to 8 in 2023. The decrease in operating income and margin were primarily due to a decrease in product manufacturing efficiencies in the U.S. and other factors as discussed above. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General 
 We have historically financed our activities through cash on hand, cash flows from operations, bank credit facilities, equity financing and the issuance of debt. Cash flows from operating activities provide the primary source of funds to finance operating needs, capital expenditures, dividends and our share repurchase program. Our ability to maintain and grow our operating income and cash flow depends, to a large extent, on continued investing activities. We believe our future cash flows from operations, supplemented by our borrowing capacity and the ability to issue additional equity and debt, should be sufficient to fund our debt requirements, capital expenditures, working capital, dividends, share repurchase program and future acquisitions. The Company will continue to monitor and evaluate the availability of debt and equity markets. 
 We are a holding company incorporated in Delaware. Therefore, we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries. Our cash availability is largely dependent upon the ability of our subsidiaries to pay cash dividends or otherwise distribute or advance funds to us and on the terms and conditions of our existing and future credit arrangements. There are no 
 32 Return to Index 

restrictions preventing any of our subsidiaries from repatriating earnings, except for the unrepatriated earnings of our Russian subsidiary which are not expected to be distributed in the foreseeable future, and there are no restrictions or income taxes associated with distributing cash to the parent company through loans or advances. As of September 30, 2024, 20.0 million of our 21.5 million of cash was held by our foreign subsidiaries. 
 The Company continues to maintain the quarterly dividend of 0.01 per share.

Comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the same period in the prior year, cash flows provided by operating activities improved to 35.8 million in 2024 compared to 5.4 million in the same period 2023. The Company improved its overall working capital primarily by lowering its level of inventory during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Cash flows used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 2.8 million were primarily driven by funding capital expenditures of 8.6 million offset by proceeds on the sale of assets of 0.9 million, net proceeds of 2.1 million from insurance recovery associated with the fire incident earlier in the year at one of the U.K. facilities and proceeds on company owned life insurance policies of 2.8 million. Cash flows used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 4.2 million were driven primarily by funding capital expenditures of 7.8 million offset by proceeds on company owned life insurance policies of 3.4 million. 
 Cash flows used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 26.6 million includes a 24.0 million net reduction in long-term debt, quarterly dividends of 1.4 million and 0.8 million costs associated with the Redomestication Transaction. Cash flows provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were nominal and primarily driven by a 6.0 million net increase in long-term debt, and 1.3 million of debt issuance costs associated with the new senior notes issued in July 2023. Additionally, we paid quarterly dividends of 1.4 million and incurred 2.8 million in costs associated with the Redomestication Transaction. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 21,458 shares of our common stock to satisfy personal tax liabilities of participants in our stock-based compensation plan for an aggregate purchase price of 0.4 million. 
 We utilize the non-GAAP financial measure of free cash flow to evaluate our cash flows and results of operations. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities (which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure) less cash paid for capital expenditures. Management believes that free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding the cash available in the period that was in excess of our needs to fund our capital expenditures and operating activities. Free cash flow is not a measure of operating performance under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation nor construed as an alternative to operating income, net income (loss) or cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, each as determined in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow does not represent residual cash available for distribution because we may have other non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from the measure. Moreover, since free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and thus is susceptible to varying interpretations and calculations, free cash flow as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 A complete discussion of our controls and procedures is included in Core Laboratories Inc.'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, under the supervision of and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024, at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. Further, the design of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our system of internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
